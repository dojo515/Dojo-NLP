Apple,"This is the version of the iphone you want if you are an international traveler from the states. Either the iPhone 5, 5c, or 5S; if you don't get the factory unlocked version online, then buy the Verizon Wireless version only. Unlike AT&T and Sprint (DO NOT buy the Sprint model, they don't support enough LTE bands for international travel) Verizon sells their phones unlocked. With AT&T you have to go through a lot of red tape just to get it unlocked; not cool. If you decided to buy directly from a Verzion store, just buy the phone without a contract and go with a month-to-month plan. People think they are getting a deal on the phone by getting the 2-year contract, but in the long run, you will be spending WAAAYYY more than if you would just spend the money for the phone out right and go with a prepaid plan. You'll save a lot more money that way. Spend $500 now and have the freedom to go with any phone company you want, or spend about $2000 for the next two years? The choice is yours... >:D",72,5
Apple,"I did not receive a Verizon wireless,as stated in the title, but instead a T-mobile wireless.",31,1
Apple,Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,11,5
Apple,"First off this is NOT a verizon phone. I put the verizon sim card in it and it did not get any cell service. I contacted verizon and they told me the serial number was not a real phone so what is it?? Ridiculous. Second. It charged one time. And did not charge agian. The phone would not take a charge. It said charging, but the battery just went down. Better get a refund.",11,1
Apple,This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time.,27,1
Apple,"Picked this phone up and was pleasantly surprised, it arrived in original iPhone packaging, all accessories included and not a scratch. I'd swear this phone was brand new perfect in every way including operation. Brought it to Verizon where they installed a new SIM card and activated the phone with contacts from an older flip model. Total time in store was about 15 minutes without a single issue. Logs on to our home network and receives a great signal and clear voice. All apps work flawlessly, not a single complaint, very pleased, highly recommended.",12,5
Apple,"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it.",21,1
Apple,"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",121,1
Apple,"The Seller didn't factory unlock this phone as stated... He kept saying that he unlocked it, and I checked with APPLE, ISP, and a couple of professionals and it was locked. I would never buy from this idiot again. He defies all logic and just keeps telling me that it's unlocked. He provided no answer other than it was unlocked, and the iphone didn't work. So I professionally unlocked the phone, and it works now.Beware of people that tell you that the iphone is factory unlocked.",75,1
Apple,"the buyer is no good. this iPhone camera didn't work and the Touch ID didn't work, I will never buy another phone here.",48,1
Apple,"I had to take this phone in after owning it for 3 months (kept in a life-proof case). I was told by Apple that it was a refurbished phone, the screen is loose, and I am having software problems. This was not a new phone as advertised.",10,1
Apple,"I bought this phone ""new"" only to find out it is not. The battery percentage was going crazy so I took it into the apple store, only to find that it had been used for the last year and a half and the battery was failing because of it. Also, the software did not pass the apple test when I took it in. So if you want a failing phone with bad software this is the right place for you!",33,1
Apple,"Okay so first of all, I emailed the seller and asked if there was any way he'd be able to get my order to me quicker, and he did just that. Secondly, the phone came ready to use. It came about half way charged all I needed to do was turn it on. Also the phone came as described, used but like new. There were a few scuffs on the top but no scratches or cracks that weren't previously mentioned from the seller. Finally, all I did was put my sim card in (T-Mobileƒ??) and the phone was working right away. I didn't have to call my phone company and this phone set up in any way. Great seller and great product.",12,5
Apple,Telephone has a lot of scratches on the screen and it was not mentioned in the description.,13,3
Apple,Do NOT buy This phone it was not unlocked as it said. It would NOT work with Verizon yet seller stated it would. I spent 1 hour 38 minutes with Verizon trying to figure it out. They called apple and Apple would not unlock it. The phone will NOT work with Verizon.,14,1
Apple,Amazon sent this phone in like new condition. The problem I have is that I didn't realize how outdated this iPhone is compared to the newest generations.... If you just want an iPhone then it is a good bargain.,22,4
Apple,All the other IPhones are overrated. The 2g works just as well. Basic. Sleek. Cool. Holds just the right amount of information that one needs.,14,5
Apple,Well I'm not sure if this one said unlocked or not but it came to us locked. However by looking it up we were able to jailbreak and unlock it. I think this is a good phone for the price. I would most defense recommend people getting it if they aren't looking to keep up with the times. However every experience is different but I think it was worth it.,16,5
Apple,"This item arrived on time, and looked great, it just didn't work. I couldn't even turn it on! Seriously I sat there for maybe 15 minutes looking at the frozen start-up screen hoping it would pass. Then, when I went to exchange it for a working one they tell me 'I see you placed this order with our subsidiary Warehouse Deals. With Warehouse Deals' inventory constantly changing, we're unable to replace your order.'So now, I have to find a printer to print out the return label, wait for it to get there, THEN wait 3-5 bussiness days for the money to get back. Don't even bother.",15,1
Apple,"***UPDATE...I forgot to mention that the phone was listed here on Amazon, as a 16gb, and it turned out when the tech at Apple ran the test on the phone, it was determined that not only was the phone junk...it was an 8gb. phone, not a 16gb. as the Seller and Amazon had listed!!! again...Beware!!!*****BEWARE AND BE ADVISED THAT THIS SELLER IS VERY DISHONEST AND A CROOK!!!!*****I BOUGHT THE 3G PHONE FROM YOU BY YOUR AMAZON LISTING STATING THAT THE PHONE IS LIKE NEW CONDITION WITH NO SCRATCHES OR ANY ISSUES OR PROBLEMS WITH THE PHONE WHAT SO EVER! PROBLEMS::::THE CASE HAS MANY SCRATCHES ON THE BACK OF IT,BUT IF THAT WAS THE ONLY ISSUE I WOULD NOT BE CONTACTING YOU. ***THE PHONE IS JUNK!! THE PHONE HAS BEEN JAIL BROKE AND WAS USED WITH ANOTHER CARRIER,(SUCH AS TEAM MOBILE). I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTERS 15th BIRTHDAY. WE DID NOT TRY TO HAVE THE PHONE ACTIVATED AS SOON AS WE RECEIVED IT, BECAUSE HER BIRTHDAY WAS A WEEK LATER. AFTER SHE OPENED THE WRAPPED UP PHONE ON HER BIRTHDAY, WITH ALL HER FRIENDS (Her Gift from us-Mom and Dad),THE NEXT DAY WE TOOK HER AND HER PHONE TO OUR LOCAL CORPORATE AT&T STORE TO HAVE THE PHONE ACTIVATED, THEY ATTEMPTED (for over 2.5 long Hours!!) TO ACTIVATE THIS PHONE. IT WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE AT&T INFO AND PROGRAM TO ACTIVATE IT AND WORK. THEY THEN SENT ME TO THE APPLE STORE AT THE SHOPPING MALL (which was over an hour away!) I had to wait 2.5 hours while a technician looked at the phone and ran test to see whether or not the phone could be activated...***THE FINAL DECISION WAS THAT THE PHONE HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH INTERNALLY AND HAD BEEN JAIL BROKEN TO ACCEPT ANOTHER CARRIER AND WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO BE RESTORED OR REASSIGNED TO AT&T!!!! I FEEL THAT YOU KNEW THAT THERE WAS AN INTERNAL ISSUE AND YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME AND TOOK MY MONEY KNOWING GOOD AND WELL THAT THE PHONE COULD NEVER BE RESTORED ACTIVATED BY ANOTHER CARRIER!!!! *** ***UPDATE...I forgot to mention that the phone was listed here on Amazon, as a 16gb, and it turned out when the tech at Apple ran the test on the phone, it was determined that not only was the phone junk...it was an 8gb. phone, not a 16gb. as the Seller and Amazon had listed!!! again...Beware!!! I AM REALLY PISSED AND THE FACT THAT YOU MADE US LOOK LIKE AN ASS TO OUR DAUGHTER, AS SHE CRIED AND WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE PHONE NOT WORKING AND NOW SHE STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PHONE!!! AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, WE BOUGHT A $60.00 DOLLAR OTTER BOX TO PUT THE PHONE IN TO PROTECT IT!! SO NOW I AM OUT $172.99 PLUS ALL MY WASTED TIME AND GAS!!! BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE....I WOULD ADVISE ANY AND ALL PROSPECTIVE BUYS TO STEER CLEAR FROM THIS SELLER AND ALL AMAZONS USED PHONES AS THEY ARE LIKE CROOKS,SCAM ARTIST AND A LAIRS!!!!!!!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!",249,1
Apple,"Though the touch pads are a bit too sensitive and the phone do sometimes 'misbehave' by self-dialing unintended contacts,phone is generally outstanding and meets my expectations.I can't ask for better!",10,5
Apple,"The phone that Amazon sent me was all scratched up, and it honestly looked as if the dropped it a few time then rubbed steel wool on the back of it. Thumbs down. This is one customer that wont be buying from Amazon anymore.",43,1
Apple,"Very pleased. The used iphone came in great condition, and actually better than I expected it would be! Great phone for the value.",42,5
Apple,"got i 3g i phone from you ..was told by amazon it was unlocked ..contacted amazon and told me to contact apple so i did and was told not there problem ...contacted amazon again ...told its the sellers fault .and was send this.... I looked into your order and see that it was placed with ""Warehouse Deals"", a seller on our website. Because Warehouse Deals's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace or send items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon. I understand this is disappointing and we are really sorry about it. DISGUSTED as it is a present for Christmas ...and now paying out of my pocket 67 euros....and no offer of paying for the unlock of the i phone ...",38,1
Apple,It turned out to be a perfect gift for a loved one works well as expected but I had to unlock it.,16,5
Apple,"The iPhone was fine. It works and is in good condition but one major thing was wrong with this product!!It was categorized under 'unlocked phones' but when I received it, it was clear that it was LOCKED! I had so much trouble with this phone and to sell a product that is different from the description on such a crucial feature is very very WRONG!",157,1
Apple,"This review is not for the product as you may find it everywhere in the www world. This is for the quality of the product that I received from the seller - Amazon Warehouse deals. I bought it used - like new condition. Luckily it came with a version of firmware that is easily unlockable (as I needed a phone to use it overseas). The quality was very good, battery holds well, screen was pristine and there were very minor scuffs and scratches on the back (which should be expected on a used piece). The sockets and ports were well cleaned up and came with NEW headphone, power adaptor and cable !! Highly recommend Amazon warehouse seller for this product.",64,5
Apple,"Bought this used locked GSM iPhone 3GS 16GB for two reasons:1. it's sold by trust-worthy Amazon WarehouseDeals2. it's advertised that product was ""From the Manufacturer""Received the phone in excellent shape, well packed, like new, with the latest 5.0 firmware. It came with a new set of genuine Apple earphones with remote and mic, dock connector to USB cable and USB power adapter. Touchscreen and battery seemed to be newly replaced as well!Googled around, selected a company on the internet that claimed to be the No. 1 iPhone unlock service provider; after payment to them, received from them a message claiming that ""software was being developed and would be available soon (without a commitment date when software will be available)"". Since then, I've never been able to get my money back through PayPal!Fortunately, there's a professional independent iPhone repair shop in town (not at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell) who could help activate, jailbreak and unlock my phone; the phone works great now! I don't have to purchase a 2-year plan, I can use the best-deal package plan I want from either at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell any time. One important note: NEVER update your firmware after the unlock, otherwise, everything will be reset to previous locked configuration!",51,5
Apple,"works very well, for the most part, but its unlocked so it took a little effort to get picture messaging to work and after every 5-7 texts or every phone call, I have to turn it off and back on to get signal.",10,4
Apple,"I bought this phone specially because it was described as UNLOCKED. When I received my phone everything was ok until I put the SIM card, phone didn't work and I had to pay initially US15 to unlock the phone, next day when I tried to download applications I couldn't because the phone was not updated to ISO 4.3 or plus. Then I had to pay US$25 to update the phone to IOS 6.0 and unlock the phone for ever. I contacted the seller and he replied saying how he could help I told him to refund the initial $15 dollars I spent he replied just saying he didn't know how to refund the money and never replied to any of my following emails. In fact the phone was in really good condition but locked I had to pay totally $154 + $40 to repair. No happy with the shopping and the seller",23,2
Apple,"i purchased this phone trusting that it is really unlocked. Apparently Amazon doesn't really check these things. I am outside the country now and cant make any calls as i keep getting invalid sim message. And then to make it worse,its a dead battery.Only a red battery line shows on the screen and this makes the phone trip off after 2 minutes. I'm so sad",12,2
Apple,"This phone is locked, and thats really a bad way to do business by displaying another label.I cannot afford to come back to US to send it back but I think this would serve as a reminder",21,1
Apple,"I bought this iphone and discovered that it is LOCKED to AT&TDon't BUY , I am returning it back to Amazon warehouse !!!",21,1
Apple,I look for an unlocked iphone and this was not. The article said iphone 3gs yet sent me an iphone 3g and I did not pay for it .... this is not right and it is wrong because it is a deception.,20,1
Apple,I am very disappointed as I ordered an Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB (Black) however received a 3g with model number A1241. All the packaging said that it was a 3gs however the phone itself is a 3g. This is made worse as I am living and working In Africa and had a friend bring it over when he visited.,19,2
Apple,"I was surprised to notice that I still need to have the phone restored before using it. I paid 70 $ to have it restored or ''unlocked'' ( according to the specialist words). The battery is not good, I need to charge twice a day even though I have not used it. I would not recommend anybody to buy it.",63,2
Apple,"I'm not too interested in having the latest technology I just wanted an iOS device that was a little more portable than my iPad 3 and I happened to be needing a new phone as well, so I decided to go with the iPhone 3GS. It was just as described by the seller, brand new, a great price, works well on iOS 6 and adequately runs all of the apps that I use frequently. Maybe later I will be tempted to update to a newer model but for now I am satisfied. Great product.",58,5
Apple,Unfortunately the product did not meet my expectations. I could not update the version of IOS (was only in the number 4). This shows that the device was unlocked not in the way that appears in the ad. I had to pay a technical assistance that confirmed the problem. I would return it and get my money back. I bought two devices on two different dates and two had the same problem.,42,1
Apple,"I bought this iphone as ""new"" and when i received it i realized it was furbished and it did not work. I ask someone to help in this case.",32,1
Apple,"The phone needed repair after 15 days, cost me $90.00 and then the battery needed to replaced 7 days after that.The phone was not new as claimed. This has been a horror story.",31,1
Apple,"I ordered a used iphone and it came on time, unlocked, updated, and in the exact condition that was listed. I have not had any issues with this phone. Compared to the price of other new or used iphones, this is a great buy. I would buy from this seller again.",11,5
Apple,"Phone was unlocked, but didn't come in a box and there was no ear piece. Therefore not sure if it was new as it was advertised",12,3
Apple,"when the battery charge drops to 70% the phone is turned off, data cable does not work.The phone looks new.",12,1
Apple,"I was really excited to get my phone. From the very first charge it stopped and started charging. I did not send back, this was my 1st I-phone and I didn't know if this was something that just came with the territory. 2 months later, the phone won't take a charge. It's a brick and it's too late to get a refund.It now serves as a pretty paperweight.Don't get ripped off thinking your experience will be different, you are flipping a coin.",13,1
Apple,It is really brand new factory unlocked Iphone 3GS and no issues at all. It is nice and great phone.,14,5
Apple,"This unlocked phone works great on T-Mobile. I just had to insert the SIM card from my old black-berry phone. Within a few minutes, it got signal. Because it was factory unlocked, it was updated to to iOS 6 just fine and remained unlocked afterward. Don't buy those iPhones that are unlocked by software, because you can't update iOS.My existing T-Mobile contract doesn't have a data plan. All I had to do was disabling 3G and Data from Settings > General > Cellular. After that Wi-Fi works fine and I don't have to pay for a data plan.Note that if you do a factory reset on the phone, the only way to get through the initial setup is either by having a data plan or activate via USB cable attached to a computer having iTune installed.The condition of the phone is dependent on who you buy it from. My copy was near perfect.",39,5
Apple,"I ordered a WORKING 3GS, and it came with a non-working mic. He blamed it on the USPS, and offered to fix it for free, but I could tell that the silver layer attached to the back cover was a bit off, so I took it to a local shop that knows who I am. I have a nose for when things don't smell right. They looked at it for free. The back cover was ghetto rigged on in a manner that the screen came out too easily, and that when a new mic was inserted, the home button would not work anymore. 607 Tech Solutions is the highest rated Tech Repair shop in Broome County, NY. They are professionals, and took the phone apart and put it back together three separate times with three new mics. I watched take an hour to do something that should have taken ten minutes on a normal device. He did not charge me, and told me to send the product back.",13,1
Apple,I ordered this used iphone for my son instead of buying him a ipod. The price was better than that of a new ipod and he can use it on his cell phone plan. The phone came unlocked and as described. He is very happy with it.,17,5
Apple,"This is a nice phone, but it is not net ten ready it can only be serviced through Verizon. I learned that the hard way and bought everything for net ten and spent two days trying to activate it to find out you can only use Verizon .",16,2
Apple,"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, who had been wanting an iPhone, for the longest time. I found this deal, and I was very excited to get it for her. I've had great experiences with the Amazon Warehouse, I've bought numerous games on here.Anyways, I went with my great experiences and bought the phone. I give the phone to her on Christmas Day. The home button does not work. After the phone is on for a long amount of time, the screen turns yellow.The worst part about it is, I have always bragged on Amazon's Customer Service. They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist. I would love for somebody from Amazon to contact me and make good on this deal. I have always respected and bragged about this company. I will never, ever pay for Amazon Prime with the treatment I have received regarding this transaction.So Amazon, thank you for ruining my girlfriend's Christmas.",366,1
Apple,"I have one and my son had to have one. I have been supporting Apple since 1983 and they now have all #1 products. The nice thing about this is you have lots of options with AT&T. We use the pay as you go plan, no 3g and we get online at hot spots which are everywhere these days. No need to spend that extra cash if you don't need to. The 4 still is new enough to get all of the upgrades from Apple too. All that I can say is that it is a great phone or as I sometimes call it my mini ipad. I use it more than I use my computer these days. I will make one recommendation, if you buy one, get ""The Otter Box case"" as it will save your phone from lots of damage and breakage.Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&TAfter 3 weeks the camera stopped working and music would go on and off and loose calls left and rightI am sending it back",105,5
Apple,"I wanted the Iphone 4 without being attached to a contract with a carrier so I decided to buy on Amazon. I was so surprised when I received the phone. It was flawless; no scratches or dings looks like new. The phone works very well and came with the apple charger, apple ear phones, documentation, and apple stickers. It shipped from the Amazon Warehouse and I am very pleased with this purchase.",85,5
Apple,"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as ""like new"". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems.",10,1
Apple,"i bought i phone 4 and this i phone supposed to be used like new but i surprised when i found the back camera is scratched and not working , really it was very bad",10,2
Apple,"The product was advertised as ...""IPHONE 4 32GB BLACK.UNLOCKED USING TURBO SIM . UNLOCKED TO USE FOR ANY CARRIER. NEW CONDITION AND COMES WITH ALL ACCESSORIES: WALL CHARGER, USB CABLE, and HEADPHONES.This phone is Brand new, with box, charger and earbuds . The phone is unlocked using Gevey""The phone works fine, but I took it to t-mobile, and they said it was locked. Also, it appears to be the 04.11.08 baseband, which is apparently more difficult to unlock than most.Sent an email, but no response after a couple of days.",46,1
Apple,"Phone waa a great purchase, was in great condition no scratches came in an iphone 4 box which was a nice touch.",45,5
Apple,Next Time you sell something you should have the box Sealed .When i got this product the Box Was Opened and it said New and you saidyou opened it to see if everything was in the box .Inside was a 16.Gb Phone Instead of a 32.Gb Phone .You tried to take me as a Skr.,27,1
Apple,"The item was sold as new, but when I received the phone it was easy to see that the phone had had its screen replaces. Not only that, the screen was poorly replaces and was moving. It was frustrating, since the item was supposed to be a gift, and so I had to find a different one at the last second.",25,1
Apple,The phone is great but I can not activate because there is a balance on the account it is linked too. Very frustrating.,24,1
Apple,The iPhone was like other experiences with iPhone orders I have had with Amazon. Everything was perfect! The phone arrived exactly on time and was in mint condition just as the seller described.,19,5
Apple,"If your an Apple customer you'll love it , just like new , no scratches or appearance of usage .Be sure to have your sim card ready for it ... Comes in box with all accessories needed.",17,4
Apple,"The iphone 4 shipped quick and came with all accessories in the original packaging. The phone looked almost brand new but the home button did not always register. Ive heard that this issue is not that uncommon because lint and dust get trapped under the button. This was however a $315 phone listed as ""like new"" so I expected it to work flawlessly. This is my first amazon return but the process has been pretty easy so far.",15,3
Apple,"i bought a cell phone that has a hardware problem, i sent it to repair to an official app store and they told me that i had been cheated by the seller...so think before buying to cell squad because it can happen the same to you!",29,1
Apple,"Bought this as a backup until I got iPhone 5. The phone was in excellent condition, without any scratches. like new.",12,4
Apple,"defective, did not disclosed was having problems, took it to apple and is not repairable, ended up buying new one, should have gone that route from the beginning, ended up paying him over 250 and for new one for 500.will not recommend to anyone for used iPhone, from internet",20,1
Apple,"After Verizon changed its upgrade cycle that coincided with both of my phone upgrades, I was left to either replace my son's non-functioning phone by purchasing an iPhone 5 for over $600, wait for next year to upgrade/replace or pay $200 to repair my son's originally free phone. I opted to check out what was being offered for last year's iPhone on Amazon and found a reasonably priced slightly used iPhone 4 with a great deal of memory. The device works as expected, no blemishes (at least none that I could find and I think there was mention of typical minor wear and tear - I saw none but I think that has to be put out there for used/refurb devices) and all cords, chargers were included in packaging. It was delivered early and my son is thoroughly pleased to go from a free Samsung smartphone to an iPhone 4 (granted he wanted the 5 but he's 15 - he'll live...besides he's happy to be at the same level his friends are at with their phones). I will be purchasing my phone this way and going outside of Verizon's market from now on. This seller is outstanding, the service and quality easily exceeds expectations. Thoroughly pleased!!!!",138,5
Apple,I had a defective speaker in the first month. I sent it back to VERY HQS and they asked if I would take the phone back if they fixed the speaker. I agreed to it for a slight reduction in price. About 2 months after that my home button started having problems. Its gotten now into the fourth month. This is a lemon. I asked for a refund for this phone that keeps having problems. They refused to take it back. Thanks VERY HQS for your customer service.,67,1
Apple,Phone works really well. I had to take to Verizon store to have activated. However I was expecting a 32gb and only received a16gb so that was disappointing.,62,3
Apple,It is great althought my home button only works half the time and so i have to hit it several times to get back to my home screen from anywhere. Not good!,38,1
Apple,At first I was almost sure I was going to get scammed because this was such a great deal! It works perfectly and I couldn't be more satisfied with my new iPhone 4. Love it! Thank you!,28,5
Apple,Camera looks like I was standing in a cloud of smoke. I loved the camera on my old phone but this one is completely useless. I wouldn't buy another used phone ever.,28,1
Apple,I spent two hours on the phone to activate it for it to not even be a Verizon phone. Its made for AT&T. Very unhappy.,24,1
Apple,"This phone doesn't pull as many reception bars as my black phone. It does most things except complete calls well. That's the trouble. What good is a phone that doesn't do its main job of completing phone calls well? And even though it was brand new, Apple said, ""It's from an outside vendor, and you're on your own.""Too bad.",19,2
Apple,though i ve been using the phone regularly i will b taking it to the apple store to exchange it the home button rarely works and the which means i had to put one on the screen and the screen doesnt shut off due to a faulty proxy sensor which means when im talking i either mute people out or im bumping buttons leaving loud beeping noises in the other persons ear,13,3
Apple,Works like an absolute charm. The seller got this too me EXTREMELY speedy and was extremely nice. Never ever had any problem with it and I've had it for almost 2 months now. Works beautifully.,17,5
Apple,Everything is fine except the home button only works half the time. But the price was pretty low and it's otherwise fully functional.,15,3
Apple,Great deal on this phone. I took a big chance and had a lot of doubt. The phone arrived on excellent condition and for the price this was a great deal. Thank you',15,4
Apple,"We bought 3 phones from Pure Mobility in December for our three kids as Christmas gifts. By March my son's phone was not working right, the on/off switch didn't work. He took it to the local Apple Store to be told that it was a pre-owned phone & had been repaired before, plus, the warranty was no longer valid due to it originally being purchased over a year ago. Now, in May, my daughter's phone does not work AT ALL! This is only 5 months after buying it! She took her phone to the Apple Store & was told the same thing...it was pre-owned AND repaired before we bought it, therefore, they can do nothing about it.We are very unhappy with our purchase and would not advise any one to purchase from Pure Mobility.When we contacted Pure Mobility, they told us that there was nothing they could do about it!! Can you believe that?!We feel that we just threw almost $1,000 in the trash.",67,1
Apple,This phone will grow on you. It is not only useful for making phone calls but serves as a mini computer and reference device for any number of tasks. It also allows you to carry with you the latest books and newspapers. It will not only lighten the amount of paper you might carry but will entertain you also.This device is highly recommended to anyone who is on the go and has no time to sit down at a desktop or lap to reference information.,12,5
Apple,"When I ordered it at the end of June, I was happy. It came fast and looked new. But In mid November IT QUIT WORKING. LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING. IT WAS NEVER DROPPED AND I HAD A CASE ON IT 24/7 AND IT JUST RANDOMLY QUIT WORKING. I am so mad . I spent a huge amount of money and its already broke? Thats bull crap.",21,3
Apple,This iphone4 cost me twenty dollars in gas and a day's work trying to get this phone fixed. I went back and forth from an apple store and my service provider. Apple gave me a new phone because the one I purchased was still under warranty. After spending all day trying to get the phone to work the apple service rep went in the back room and got the original phone and did a history check from the original owner up until I got the phone. Status unlocked: False. The apple rep told me they could not change the status of the phone they were required to return my new phone with the same set up as the old phone. The apple rep said until the person or company I got the phone from change the settings to factory unlocked there would not be anything I could do with this phone. I sent an email to Amazon about the problem and they were going to contact the provider with this issue. To date I have heard nothing from the provider or Amazon. If I could rate the product with a zero star I would. Right now I have spent over three hundred dollars out of my pocket and lost a day's work. The best thing I could do with this phone is make a boat anchor with it but it would not even be good for that. I found out by trying to save money it would have been better just to buy a new phone. I guess the old saying holds true you get what you pay for.,12,1
Apple,"I recieved my Iphone4 in the mail and was so excited to see that it was practically brand new. No scratches, no visible defects just like as the description said. I love it and I would order again from the seller!",14,5
Apple,"I purchased the iPhone 4. I am extremely pleased with the product. The phone is in great condition, it looks brand new. It came with a charger, headphones, and a quality Outterbox phone case. I got the phone activated at Ntelos with no problem and everything works perfectly. Also, shipping was very fast. I would recommend this seller! Thanks for the wonderful purchase!",10,5
Apple,"Let me start off by saying this phone does in fact work with straight talk. I was also kind of skeptical of it too but I was reassured by the seller (iconverwireless) that it would work with straight talk. Matt, the one I contacted was so helpful. The phone arrived in 3 days and in great condition. It did not include Apple stickers or earbuds but I didn't want any, so no loss. We got the phone activated in less than 4 min. No joke. This phone was amazing, and DOES work with straight talk. Totally recommend. ????",52,5
Apple,"I bought this phone of the 4th of December and shouldve received it by the 18th as a Christmas present but it got here the 27th. This phone was to be used for Straight Talk, only the sim card that is sent with the phone isnt for Straight Talk so you will need to buy a different SIM card. There were no instructions, no order form. I am still waiting for the seller to contact me so I can return it!!! Do not order this phone! Its not worth the headache! You'd be better off buying a brand new IPhone for a few more dollars.",10,1
Apple,It a great phone and worth the price! It's fast and easy to use. It's easy to set up. I am very happy with it.,47,5
Apple,"We are very satisfied with the phone, it has worked better than expected. We were told it would work in some area codes in our area, but so far it has worked for us. Would recommend this phone and the no contract plan.",30,5
Apple,I love my phone it came way earlier than it was supposed to. It did not come with headphones but it came with everything else mentioned. My sisters are even buying phones from here I recommend it !,27,5
Apple,"Everything was delivered so quickly and perfect condition!! My only advice to you (for those of us who are NOT tech smart) is when including instructions on how to register the phone for straight talk, explain that the ""access code"" is replacing the ""meid"" number b/c they asked me for that meid number SO many times & I went round & round with them for over an hour before I figured that one out!! Ha! Not tech smart!! But you give great quality service & product!",12,5
Apple,Received the phone early which is a definite plus since I'm impatient. Looks brand new and got it all set up with no issues. The only issue I had was I was not aware that it didn't come with a charger before I bought it. No biggy since I can get one at any gas station.,12,4
Apple,"Decent but there are some serious errors in its shippment and description. pros: no damage, came in box (sealed) , with charger and headphones. cons: its meant to be used for a verizon phone only, and cannot be converted to straight talk (regular sim card slots were not built in), and it came with no phone card like promised and described. overall: good phone and i like it, but it simply wasnt what i ordered! blame: the sellers of the phone (ship fast tech llc) who did not deliver what they promised in their ad, used false advertising, and have not altered it even after similiar or more critical reviews refered to the straight talk dilemma. if u want striaght talk, dotn buy this, if you dotn care and just want an iphone 4, go ahead, but watch out, you might not be a lucky as me.",12,3
Apple,"When i recieveed my phone, way ahead of the exspected delivery date, The seller ""sikksounds"" had given me a free upgrade to a 16gb, which was great and much appreciated. The phone was in almost perfect condition, and came with all the acsessories. I was very satisfied with the phone, but ultimatley had to return it do to straight talk not letting me activate it in my area, but Andy was extremly understang and immeadatly refunded me my money and gave me a return label within the hour i originally contacted him. I would highly reccomend him for his great service!",22,5
Apple,I greatly appreciated the fact that it DID INDEED come before christmas. I didnt recieve any texts or emails of where the package was at any given time. You should work on that. But it was a good feeling to see my little brothers face when he opened his present and saw a new iphone. Thnxs :3,15,4
Apple,"Check out this facebook page that outlines their shady business practices: [...]The 1-star rating is not for the iphone itself - that would be a 5-star. The 1-star rating is for the seller - WIREOVIAI bought this in March 2012, seeing that it was ""Factory Unlocked by Apple, Never Opened"" and ""New In Shrink-Wrap and Original Packaging"".Just yesterday, a little over 2 months of having the phone, the speaker stopped working so I bring it into Apple, thinking it would be covered under warranty.The apple employee informs me that the iphone was owned and registered in September 2010 - 17 months before I bought this ""new"" iphone.Do not buy ANYTHING from this vendor - WIREOVIA - as you cannot trust the authenticity of what they're selling! What you buy would also not be covered under the manufacturer's warranty if it's older than you think it is. You will just end up with a useless, piece of junk and less several hundred dollars.",177,1
Apple,"""I've had the MOST FRUSTRATING experience with this seller in my life. I wouldn't actually leave any stars for them, just had to. This was iPhone 4s box, the bottom of the which was roughly sealed with some dirty paper to cover the real specks, it was blocked and 16 GB instead of 32 GB. Moreover, the seller wouldn't confirm the return of this product despite my 2 emails to them. I do not recommend anyone to do business with this seller ever!!!""",80,1
Apple,"The phone looked good when I opened it but once I started using it I felt that some part of the touch screen is not recognizing the taps. I tried several tests to ensure the problem and finally I went to apple website and follow the resolution but for no improvement. But when I tried to enter the serial no and seek help from Apple specialists system denied saying 'Service coverage expired' where as I am supposed to get 1 yr warranty as per the seller commitment.I looks like although this is claimed as New, it is a replaced/refurbished phone. I felt very sad and need to return it.",66,1
Apple,"I bought this Iphone form SJohnson236, and they send me locked Iphone with Gevey Adapter and ATT Software, I returned it the same day, and I got the refund, Thanks to Amazon",10,1
Apple,"It wasnƒ??t only a refurbished item instead of unused item. The IPhone 4 I received and sent back is a fraud.On october 17, I spent more than 2 hours at the Genius Bar of Apple Store at 5th Avenue, New York. They recommended me to do a back up first and come back the other day.The following day, 18, in Apple Store at 14th Street, New York, I spent another 2 hours at the Genius Bar just to know 1) that they couldn't just replace the phone because it was out of warranty - it expired two years before, one year after it had been bought by its first owner, in June 2010. So if wanted a replacement I'd have to pay US$ 150 for it - which I accepted; and 2) at the very moment of the transaction, the guy who served me at the shop counter noticed something in the iPhone and asked me to wait. He checked the serial number and found that the iPhone was originally a black one - the one I bought was a white one. He couldn't replace it.They didn't have a new iPhone 4 to sell, and I needed desperately to buy a cell phone because I was leaving the next day to Brazil. I bought an iPhone 5C unlocked for $649 + taxes, as you can see in the annexed file. Total: US$ 706.59.If you want to be fair, please deposit the difference of U$ 266,50 (706,59 - 439,98) I had to pay. I wont charge for the four hours of my vacation I wasted at Appleƒ??s counter, neither for the worry and inconvenience I had with your item .I send alrady several emails and I'm still waiting for an answer. Hope to hear from you soon.",10,1
Apple,I'm paying over 400 for this iPhone which is fine but don't advertise that the phone is excellent condition if the home button is broken and the back glass seems like it was put in unprofessionally. The camera hole in the back is not align with the glass.,28,2
Apple,"When I received this iphone 4 it was in great condition, but it somehow slipped through the cracks and the unlock and updated os was not completed. I found this out when I tried to have a prepaid service turned on and shelled out $60 for a chip that was nonrefundable. I was furious, I expected the worst to try and resolve this issue, but when I emailed him on Friday night about 6 pm western time he responded within 20 minutes. He apologized profusely and talked me through how to finish the unlock and update til 11:30. then when I installed my new chip it works fine and has been fine ever since I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. Things happen and he stood behind his product well past regular business hours.",27,5
Apple,This product was an OLD re-built iPhone pieced together and sold for WAY too much money! I bought this product specifically for traveling overseas so I could substitute SIM cards in different countries. I had problems with it and took it into an Apple Store. They examined it and said the serial number had been changed as well as the components. I had to buy a REAL iphone from them. The warranty period was very short but I plan to discuss this with Amazon.com to see if anything can be done to refund my money.This seller is a total rip-off - donƒ??t buy from Ross Cellular!,22,1
Apple,"When I got the package everything looked all right, but appearances can be deceiving. The USB connector would not accept any cable, just the one shipped inside. This is weird, but I could live with that glitch. Then, 2 weeks later, I noticed that all pictures taken with the front camera got blured and the 5M Pixels back camera had some issues in focusing the image.After 2 months using, I figured some extra bad surprises. The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear ""pops"" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the ""Face Proximity Sensor"" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not ""Very good"" as advertised. Not at all!! I payed a good money for it, and will cost me a lot of extra money to repair it, which is not acceptable.",16,1
Apple,"I was sold a phone by this seller under the description of ""used like new"", the package arrived before the due date which was awesome and appeared to be as described, COSMETICALLY . The next day the charger wasn't working, no big deal chargers are easy to replace. A week to the day I received the product it quit working completely. I notified the seller immediately!! He replied within 2 hours, explaining he worked in the week and would get back to me over the weekend with options of how to go about fixing the problem. Which in turn ended up in me sending a second email of which he informed me that he would not give me a refund, and offered $40 maximum... I BARLEY HAD THE PHONE A WEEK!!!!! THE PHONE WAS NOT IN WORKING CONDITIONS, AND I SPENT ALMOST $400 IN THE PRODUCT AND SHIPPING FOR A BROKEN PHONE THAT THE SELLER BELIEVES IS NOW ONLY WORTH $40!!! I AM BEYOND UPSET AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE MAKE A PURCHASE FROM CAM-O-RAMA WITH OUT HAVING A LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE TO LOOK FOR LOOP HOLES IN THE REFUNDING DEPARTMENT! I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING OFF OF AMAZON KNOWING THAT THERE IS REALLY PEOPLE LIKE THIS OUT HERE!! I read almost all the reviews and ratings before buying from this seller, as well as other sellers before making my purchase. I am now out of $400 dollars, and have a black screened iphone to show for it! THANK YOU CAM-O-RAMA!! FOR NOTHING!""Since I can only provide DOA (dead on arrival) guarantee and because the phone wasdelivered as in described condition (used but fully functional), Iwon't be able to take a full return for it. HOWEVER, I always do thebest I can to help my buyers. I would like to offer you a $40 refund...""",16,1
Apple,"I purchased the iPhone 4s through Amazon to try and save money. I have tried to activate the phone through Sprint only to find that it is stolen. I am returning the phone today and if my money is not returned I will take legal action. Save the hassle and just don't buy from this company. Keep in mind this review is solely rated to the seller, NOT the iPhone 4s",84,1
Apple,"There are a few things I would like to say about this:1. This item DID NOT come in the original iPhone box.2. The charger for the iPhone DOES NOT work.3. When information from amazon was confusing at first during a chat session, the seller didn't even read the PDF file attached to a complaint including such confusing information, and I got customer service in a very rude and unpleasant attitude. I was even threatened to be reported to Amazon, situation that never happened and I have e-mails and evidence to proove it.4. I got 10 usd in reward from amazon for the whole situation, which DOES NOT compensate all I went through.Conclusion: I still have a locked phone with Sprint with a charger that doesnt work, and my problem remains unsolved.Sorry but if there was a chance to give MedMedia246 half a star or even a NEGATIVE rate i would definetely do it.",68,1
Apple,"Got iPhone it looked fine until after i turned it on and the set up was complete. I then found that it was someones phone, it still had all their text messages and contacts in it, all there apps, ect. I contacted Srint to find that it is not lost or stolen, and can be activated. Still, the page said new iPhone and it was not it had been activated for 4 months. For $100 dollars more I could have bought a brand new one at retail price, just be aware of what you're getting yourself into.",10,1
Apple,"I ended up returning the phone! I ordered an iPhone 4S for a sprint! When I got it, it was for a Verizon phone! Also, the lock button didn't work, and then the back kept slipping off, and lastly at the bottom of the screen it looked funky! I was frustrated cuz I was gonna give it as a gift to my fianc??e :( I emailed the seller, and asked about it, and they told me (check this out) they told me that somewhere (which I couldn't find!) that it said in the description not compatible with Sprint!! What?!?!! It was advertised as a Sprint phone! Anyways, the person started to argue with me and told me that I was wrong! Nice! Anyways... I returned it, and I got my money back, so I thank them for that... Never going to buy from them again!",10,1
Apple,"dont buy it from this person, they are stolen. whoever it is will send it to you with no esn on it, so that means it's stolen. plus they are pretty much jipping you about 200 dollars.",24,1

Apple,"I recently bought an iPhone 4S from this seller. When it arrived it looked fine. We went to Verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. The camera light would not turn off, the tech said that's a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. I booked a Genius Bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. When they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.Contacted the seller who sent us another iPhone 4S. POTENTIAL BUYERS READ THIS: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. It's even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn't supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I'm fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. Remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iPhone.",152,1
Apple,"I try to activate the iphone 4s in front of the Verizon wireless, but the service told me that the iphone 4s I just bought from Werehouse Deal is a stolen one!!!!",120,1
Apple,"Although the description doesn't say it's a new phone, it doesn't say it's a used one either, the one I got had all kinds of information from the previous owner. I don't have a problem buying a refurb, but I'd like to pay the price of one, not a slightly lower price than brand new one. So beware, you may be looking to buy a used phone.",113,1
Apple,"This is a defective phone advertised under the precept of it being used - VERY good condition. Advertised as slight water damage causing screen to have minor discoloration on top and bottom, no crack screen ..which we discovered meant in reality that it was severely water damaged, the camera didn't work (very good condition ..not), it had a replacement screen that was not properly connected to give complete visibility (no crack screen ..of course not it was replaced), the screen continuously jumped up and down and evenly went black (which i'm not sure if that is better or worse than the minor discoloration on top and bottom of screen) all within 3 hours of activating the phone. This phone was in anything but good condition, and dishonest semantics justified dishonest behavior and that is bad business dealing for such (what I thought was) a trustworthy site as Amazon.",54,1
Apple,The phone was supposed to be new but it clearly wasn't. The battery is shot and drains itself completely in about an hour. And when I plugged it into the computer there was already someone's name associated with it.,53,2

He did contact me to say that he had to get the phone first before he gave me my 300.00 back. The phone was delivered to his home a few days ago and I have not heard anything yet. I am going to contact them next. I am very disappointed that this is a seller of amazon and he can get away with selling stolen phones.",38,1

As for the charger I got, It was a used charger and didnt work at charging my iphone. I contacted customer service and they told me to contact Apple. I contacted apple then went back to the seller to try and get my AC charger replaced or have them send me a new one. Niether has happened. Very disappointed in the customer who is selling this product. Bottom line is phone is great seller is terrible.",31,3
Apple,"I had a droid phone and had lots of problems. Verizon swapped it out 3 times and the problems never ceased. Got this phone and love it. No problems, no glitches and have signal. Love it!!",25,5
Apple,The seller stated the phone was in good condition and that the phone was being sold with conversion kit and original white cover. It was altered by apple with a green conversion kit. The phone had a few scratches on the edges but most importantly the seller did not state that all pictures taken with the cameras flash on have a green light on them from the conversion kit. Also the original white case was not included.,12,3
Apple,All good! Item as described - even came with a bonus case. Would have no problem dealing with this trader again.,19,4
Apple,"This iPhone 4s worked good, but it looked like refurbished. I bought this for my friend in China, and she liked it very much.",13,5
Apple,i dislike because they sold an broken phone to me and this phone is locked on the verizon so it cant use other sim cards,17,1
Apple,It was advertised as a Verizon phone but in reality it was a sprint phone. Completely useless to me considering my provider is Verizon.,14,1
Apple,Is a phone brand new if there's no plastic around the box? Original screen protector sheets around the phone? A hair in the the box? After I cleaned the fingerprints the phone only worked after I removed and reinserted the SIM card. I love iPhones and couldn't stand being without it so I did not contact the seller. But beware of who your buying from when not directly buying from amazon.,14,3
Apple,"Yeah, so don't buy this phone. It's not unlocked. These dudes are either incompetent, scamma-lamma-ding-donging us, or unable to articulate exactly what they think ""unlocked"" means.",159,1
Apple,"My first review on Amazon after being a customer for over a decade. This is a total fraud, the charger is cheap off the street, as for apple packaging see the picture of attached box and the plastic sleeve it came in.",141,1
Apple,"Extremely disappointed.I purchased the phone as unlocked. It had ATT label on the box and did not read my SIM card. I called and got a replacement which was no different than the first one (also locked). The overall quality of the phone is bad and the charger parts do not fit properly into each other. The first one I charged over night and the battery emptied out after few hours without any use! (as the phone was not even activated!!)I also had problems with the shipping company. They do not stick to the hours they post on the website. They told me the item was delivered when it was still on its way!Now after wasting four days between the first one and the replacement, I will have to go through the headache of returning the 2 phones.",128,1

Apple,"I'm really not happy with the quality of these phones. I have ordered two used and factory refurbished. One had an amazingly horrible battery. I charged it to 100%"" set it up, and it was almost dead. And would die as soon as it hit five percent. So I ordered this one. It arrived with its test pictures still on it, the background was not reset to factory settings, and to make matters worse it won't connect to the Internet! My phone got stolen out of my car, iPhones are crazy expensive, and I thought factory refurbished from Amazon would be the cheaper way to go. Definitely NOT! Think twice before ordering these phones!!!",10,2
Apple,Phone is not unlocked as described. It is a Verizon phone. Waited a long time for this phone as I live in Central America and can't return it. What a waste of time and money.,38,1
Apple,"I am very angry.This phone is not Refurbished phone.The iphone's back has many hairline scratchesand Battery life is very short. Is only one-fifth of the normal.Setup iOS version is 9.0, so iphone speed is very slow.OMG purchase.",31,1

Apple,"The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue.",24,3
Apple,I was conscious of buying a iphone online due too so many people getting ripped off by a broken iphone sent to them or stolen one that can't be activated even. Best advice i can give read the sellers reviews and positive reviews number anywhere between 90 to 98 you should be fine. I have been wanting a iphone for awhile but i don't have 600 to shell out for one. About this iphone it is a 4s it has a sim card slot side it was a unlocked phone which it maybe but said cell phone carrier Verizon. So my best guess it is unlocked and previous owner used them. either way it worked just fine with Straight Talk i could text and send photos. I have a sim card slot but did not have to use it they ask me for some numbers and it worked. The video is ok i would say a lot better then old cellphone. 1080/30p good for taking pics with family friends video. Or a good stand by but by no means should this be used for professional filmography. The buttons are on the left a two volume buttons up and down and button to set the phone to ring on be silent. Theres a home buttom that is round wit a Square graphic the to button right issleep/shut down towards the left is a head phone jack and what seems to be a mic. Wifi works the apps store is great you can download a free magic app or google voice to make free wifi calls. Wifi does work. It runs IOS 9.3 the newest one. Memory 16GB you may want to a little more on a 32 GB. Icloud gives you 5GB free which is not a lot.,23,5
Apple,Was locked to Verizon Useless for me.,12,1
Apple,"Good afternoon amazon, the iphone was received in good physical conditions but with some marks, however the phone is desactivated and the screen indicates to conect it to a pc by using itunes, I tried to activate it through iTunes without success. The iphone is inoperative. Plase i hope you can help me so i can use the article i bought.",22,1
Apple,The phone looks brand new! There are no scratches anywhere. The charger was even wrapped as the new ones! I've tried it with my at&t unlocked sim card and with an international sim card and it works perfectly so far.,20,5
Apple,The phone looks great and was well packaged. At first I was concerned that the phone was not fully unlocked because it was a verizon phone but everything works great. I dont know why some customers had issues with this phone being an old verizon phone unless they just never tried putting a sim card in it but im satisfied with everything,17,5
Apple,"I was so excited to get this however:1) I ordered an UNLOCKED phone and the one shipped to me was clearly labeled for Verizon. Right I'd give it a try anyway. No dice.2) the ""flash"" light on the back will not turn off.3) arrived dead, charged overnight to 100%, spent an hour updating the software, battery already at 50%.Highly disappointed, sending in for a refund",17,1
Apple,The title says it is unlocked. But acctually it is locked to verizon. What happened to Amazon? There are more and more liers now. I am really disappointed.,17,1
Apple,"Got here a day early, however the battery would constantly act up, the phone would shut off and say it was dead, it over heated and lastly--it just stopped sending texts. Returning asap.",14,1
Apple,"buy 2 , one would run a few weeks the wifi and then stopped when I wanted to make a claim had already spent time replacement",15,2
Apple,"I did something stupid with my iPhone and needed to order another one. I got one from Amazon's used selection figuring that a few scratches would just be a minor issue. What I received was a unit that looked like new. After updating the software, everything worked like a champ. And just like the one I destroyed, this one is a lot more useful than I ever thought it would be. From the mail application to the flashlight. From Maps to the phone. It's just a handy little device and unlike the Android devices, at least the ones I've seen, a lot more intuitive which is great for me since I don't like to read manuals :-).",19,5
Apple,"At the time I was reviewing my options to order a phone, I read the different comments by the sellers, as well as the feedback by previous buyers. I cannot stress the importance of this when ordering a phone.The long and short is that I ordered the same device from another seller first. And in the selling comments, it ""implied"" that the device will ship quickly. However, if you read the fine print, or the delivery window, that truly told the story. It is my belief that certain sellers may actually list an item more than once, and over the several week timeframe they have to ship it out, well, I beleive they end up shipping it to the highest bidder. Basically, I never received the phone that was described as perfect. Might be a scam.That brings me to this seller. Not only did I receive my phone, (described as good condition), but in reality, the phone i received was FLAWLESS!!It truly was PERFECT!! The original apple box was intact, the headphones, charging cord, and outlet were all in the original packaging sleeves, and the phone looked brand new!! Not even a tiny scratch.We just activated it yesterday, and so far so good. So I'm just saying, if you are looking at buying a used iPhone, make sure you consider buying from a seller with reviews...and good ones at that. I really think this is important to share with others looking for iPhones. Especially after having the bad experience in trying to buy from someone who posted a long delivery window. I believe the delivery window gives them time to achieve the most amount of money while the people who ordered it had their dreams crushed while waiting for a phone they thought they would receive.What happens, is that at the end of the delivery window, the seller will send a bogus apology letter to the buyer stating that they could not ship it because they found some malfunction on the device.I SWEAR THIS HAPPENS!! I have such a letter to prove it from an order placed (on a different cell phone) several months ago!!!",94,5
Apple,"...without checking the serial number against the lost and stolen list with your carrier. We made the mistake of buying a used iPhone 4S without doing that and after we received it from an Amazon vendor, we found that it could not be activated because it was previously listed as lost or stolen. To Amazon's credit they refunded our money through their A to Z Guarantee. But don't put yourself in that position, check the serial number with your carrier BEFORE you buy!",67,1
Apple,"I ordered this and as I opened the box, noticed there was no plastic wrap around the box, then opened up the box and the phones jack looked used...and it wasn't a Verizon phone, it was already used before with Sprint!!!? I figured well maybe its just me, either way took it to Verizon and they had a problem programming the phone..well, I decided to get all the guess work out. The phone was NOT NEW, but USED and it was NOT a Verizon Phone.Sent it back via Amazon. Love Amazon...they know what to do...I mean the phone was over 600.00 dollars why would anyone think people would not notice these things.They took it back, even apologized, well of course...Don't cheat honest people, not all of us are unaware of what we get!",48,1
Apple,The iPhone was a gift for my granddaughter and upon receiving the iPhone we had difficultly trying to activate the iPhone with Verizon. I immediately contacted the seller and he responded so quickly wanting to do anything to resolve the issue. I did end up returning the iPhone and did receive a new iPhone that we have connected and it is working great. It was good to know that this seller takes pride in providing quality service and product. I would highly recommend this seller.,12,5
Apple,"I had been looking for a replacement iPhone 4S since I accidentally drowned my original Verizon purchase and ruined it. A Verizon Wireless rep suggested that used phones purchased through one of Amazon's used item stores where probably a safe bet. Referencing an email from Amazon based on my past searches, I looked at the phones sold by Amazon Warehouse Deals.This was a used phone, packed in the original Apple sealed packaging. No problems, cosmetic or otherwise. Phone was easily set up and activated without any assistance from Verizon Wireless service reps.When activating your phone to replace the dead phone, be sure to use the ""Reset to Factory Settings"" option under settings which essentially makes your used iPhone a ""new"" phone. I also found my current iCloud backup on the phone and restored that so that my apps and contacts would be current.Dialing *228 from the new phone will contact Verizon Wireless and activate the replacement iPhone. You will be prompted for the number of the phone you are replacing and the last four digits of your Social Security number to verify you are the legit owner of the account (you were asked for this info when the account was created). In a few seconds, your new phone will be activated and ready to use.There is no need to follow the documented iTunes activation procedures to get the replacement phone online.Regardless of what other articles say, there was no need to know the ESN (MEID) of the old or new phones or remove the battery to find this info (note that a charged iPhone displays its MEID under settings).",23,5
Apple,Once you go Apple you will never go Back! Best investment ever made! No problems with soft wear glitches and not getting messages. Def recommend to a friend.,12,5
Apple,I recovered the product faster than expected and in excellent condition. It didn't come with the proper iPhone box but did have headphones and a charger.,19,5
Apple,"No contract, unlimited data plan and a phone that works!The condition of the iPhone is great, I'm completely happy with this purchase.",13,5
Apple,"My family has a Verizon family share plan with unlimited data. With Verizon's new policies, we cannot get any more subsidized phones without losing our unlimited data plan. We currently need to replace a few phones with ""global"" phones, so I have been looking at either purchasing new without contract, or purchasing used.I took the risk and purchased a ""used - like new"" phone from Amazon Warehouse Deals. The phone arrived in the original box, but the box was rather messy and held shut with scotch tape. Inside the package, the charger, cable, and headphones were all there and appeared to be unused.The phone itself had no scratches whatsoever but did have a tiny nick in one corner. However, I had to look hard to find it. Under casual inspection, the phone appears brand new. The prior owner must have protected the phone well with case and screen protector.The phone had been fully reset and cleared so it came up the same as a factory fresh phone. I had no trouble activating the phone with my existing Verizon account. This was my biggest worry because I have purchased used phones before that had been stolen or lost and Verizon would not activate them. In general, if a phone is replaced under warranty, then the original phone cannot be re-activated.The only problem I have was that the micro-SIM card was missing. Normally, Verizon provides a micro-SIM tied to your own number that is used when you are travelling internationally and need to use the GSM network. It is possible that, even if the SIM was provided, it wouldn't have worked for me. I made a quick call to Verizon, and they are sending me a free SIM in the mail.I have only been using the phone for two days now. The battery seems to be holding a charge well. I will update this review if I have any problems with the battery.So far so good. If I don't have any problems in the next few weeks, I will be buying another from Amazon Warehouse Deals. I am still uncomfortable with purchasing a used phone from a random vendor.=== Updated Jan 2014 ===Nine months later, and all is well. I have now purchased three ""like new"" 32G iPhone-4S models from Amazon Warehouse Deals so everyone in the family has a global phone. The first two came in previously used iPhone boxes. The third came with plain cardboard packaging. All three phones were in great shape and all three came with headphones, charger, and USB cable. I have no complaints whatsoever and will buy from Warehouse Deals again.",18,5
Apple,"The seller did a really good job on shipping quickly. I received the phone before the estimated due date which was great. What wasn't so great was the condition of the phone. It wasn't like new at all. The bottom part where the charging port is was all dented. There were also markings on the top part of the phone where the power button is situated. Amazon's description of Used - Like New: An apparently untouched item in perfect condition. Original protective wrapping may be missing, but the original packaging is intact and pristine. There are absolutely no signs of wear on the item or its packaging. Instructions are included. Item is suitable for presenting as a gift.There were no instructions and no box. The phone had been put in bubblewrap and shoved in a postage box with the accessories. Additionally, the ""free accessories"" that were provided had seen better days. The otterbox case was supposed to be white but it was so dirty and scratched it couldn't have been used.Now this may seem like I'm nit-picking but I really am not. I expected a like new phone and didn't get one. When you fork out $349 and it doesn't meet your expectations, it's very disappointing. Not to mention the fact it's a lot of money.Overall the seller was understanding, although he stood by his description and said the condition is subjective and down to the end users interpretation. Misleading in my book. So the phone was returned and I did get a full refund - thankfully.",14,2
Apple,"Caution. What he sells to you is something that does not work. I opened my ""brand new"" (purchased thinking it was new not refurbished) iphone and tried to set it up while I was in the car. It told me to hook it up to itunes so I did on my laptop, but it gave me an error. Took it to the apple store and i was notified that it had been wet. That there was a red spot on top of the phone that notifies that it had been tainted with water. I notified the seller and he tried to blame it on me saying that if I had wet it somehow. Like really? I got it and saw it did not work and took it to the apple store, which I was told that I would have to buy a whole new one because this phone does not have warranty in any way not even the 30 day warranty that you should get and he advertises. I would ask the seller questions about the iphone and he was very rude. I asked him if I can have a refund and he said ""Well I guess knowing the amazon policies"". So if it was up to him he would not refund anything, even though he is selling cheap stuff that does not work at all. It is just a waste of money if you guys go and buy from him.",79,1
Apple,"Advertised as: New, in the box, sealed w/ original shrink-wrap, never opened, iPhone 4S, factory unlocked. Received item not shrink-wrapped, w/ minor marring on edges of iPhone, locked to AT&T, dirty places on box. No way this is just a ""mistake."" Clearly, a mass hit or miss on order recipients as to who will or will not make a fuss about it, and odds are, many will use AT&T as their carrier upon receipt so it would not even come up. Hate being baited and switched by anyone. Have asked for return and replacement, but will change to just return and refund as do not trust seller now.",56,1
Apple,"Bought a white 34GB iphone for my brother 18 Bday and paid for 2 day shipping because I was going to the US for a few days. Wireovia sent a 16GB and I notice when I was outside the US. Contact seller and they could not provide my with what information they needed to fix my problem form the start. Several emails and about 2 days had pass before a solution could be provided. Just when the problem seems solved I discover that the iphone doesn't work. Can't make or receive calls, local iphone provider says it's hardware problem not software. BEWARE with seller.",20,1
Apple,"This is a lie my Iphone came opened and with no original charger also it comes tight with a garbage bag closure, I feel cheated!! Do not buy from them.",18,1
Apple,This was defective item. The product was said to be factory unlocked gsm worked any where world wide .Its not working,10,1
Apple,I order this and upon receipt of the order found that this item was defective and not what was advertised. When I approached the seller he refuse to refund me saying that it was over a month old and he did not guarantee the item after a month. I advise any one else who buys from this seller examine closely your product before doing anything else.,33,1
Apple,I cannot talk about the product as it is not working. I bought it on September 7th with transformers and gsm phones as an unlocked phone worldwide and it is LOCKED by orange UK. I have been exchanging e-mails with the company and until now I was not able to have my money back and return the i-phone. They said they would send me a label for me to return it to the USA and now they say that they cannot send the label outside USA. I would like Amazon to help us out with this issue because the money was already taken from my credit card and I still do not have a phone or my money back! How disappointing!!!,15,1
Apple,"My teenaged daughter loved her iPhone 4 but only had 16GB of storage for her music and photos (wait! It's a PHONE, right?) so this is the perfect solution. She gets an upgrade on the storage to 64GB and gets Siri without switching to an iPhone 5. Saves us the huge cost of a new phone 5 which she doesn't want; she keeps the version (iPhone 4) she loves.IMPORTANT:Be sure you check the specific item details to make sure the phone you're buying is the right one for your carrier. We were lucky. The phone we bought said ""Verizon"" in the description and it only took us a few minutes to get it authorized as a replacement on our Verizon account. Consider asking the seller for the IMEI number (found in General/About/IMEI) to confirm the phone will work or is not stolen BEFORE you buy it. The purchase will take longer but is the only guarantee that once you receive the phone it will work.Hopefully your purchase will be successful like ours",11,5
Apple,"I am from QATAR, and the new Iphone 4s factory unlocked is something unbelievable. I can use it here in the Middle East or Europe or US or anywhere!

Apple,"Fast delivery, iPhone is new and unlocked as advertised by seller Wholesale Connect LLC.Came with all accessories in sealed box. Works perfectly after installation of SIM.Very pleased. After reading reviews all over Amazon that people were getting phones that weren't unlocked or were refurbished when advertised new, I am glad this seller is as advertised. Will buy again.",12,5
Apple,I chosen this phone because it was advertised as UNLOCKED and it was not. Very disappointed!!!!!,76,1
Apple,"I was very excited to receive this phone after my old one was stolen from behind the register while I was working. It came on time, however, the phone was very scratched up. The sides were chipped and the phone looked as though it had been dropped multiple times. I'm disappointed in the seller, but I do not have the time to return the item and wait for a new phone.All in all, I am disappointed with this expensive product. I definitely expected more from it. Read the reviews, do your research, and proceed carefully.",10,4
Apple,I was not happy at all. When I received the phone it did not work you could not hear the person on the other end. When I made contact I did receive a return label timely but if I received a broken product I should not have to pay shipping and handling but I did. Also I was expecting for it to be resolved before Christmas due it was a gift. So for me I will not recommend this company to anyone.,10,1
Apple,"False advertising. The battery didn't hold a charge. It would die within an hour of use. They state the phone works with AT&T and T-Mobile but fail to mention it is not compatible with either network's LTE bands, even though it is led to be believed that is the case. It did not come with the original charger or cable, but instead a third party charger and cable. I love the iPhone, but I cannot recommend the company selling these products due to their lack of honesty and integrity. Thank God for Amazon returns.",11,1

Apple,"When you read it, you think it is a certified refurbished by Apple and would come in the manufacturer packaging. But it is certified by 3rd party whose refurbishment work is way worse than buying conventional used smart phone. Vibration is not working, WiFi is not detecting easily.Please note that I have received the product unlike described.Although it says ""Incl. all original accessories"", it actually came with a low quality charger and USB cable. Also there was no headphone. Please check the attached photo of the package as received !!!",124,1
Apple,"This phone came without all original accessories (no earphones, no SIM ejection tool, and no quick-start guide). More importantly, its battery was beyond its useful life. Do not purchase this product.",119,1
Apple,"The phone itself is fine, but the claim that it comes with all original accessories is false. Mine came with a fake charger, fake cable, no earphones, no sim ejection tool and no quick-start guide.The fake charger and cable were identified as un-certified by the phone, and would not charge it, rendering it useless until I went to the local Apple store and purchased genuine ones. The fake ones don't look anything like the real ones.Unless you are replacing a previous phone and have all the accessories, don't touch this.",116,1
Apple,this phone did not work correctly. it constantly buzzed when i was on calls and no one could hear me.,96,1
Apple,Thank you for phone! It works great. Phone came with charger(not original) but it's okay.,51,5
Apple,It did not work. It would not keep a password. I changed my apple password 6 times. I took the phone to tmobile they couldn't figure it out they told me to take it to apple. They couldn't get it to remember a password either. I sent back last Monday.,41,1
Apple,Works Great????Looks Brand New. Had No Marks or Scratches. I love it????,12,5
Apple,i got completely used phone with lot of scratches... if i use it for 5 minutes its heating a lot...,17,1
Apple,"The phones were looking as brand new and working perfectly. I bought 2 phones at the time. Both of them were unsealed. They are working perfectly and look like brand new. But inside the box were the headphones that was worth probably 3$. Sound was awful, the buttons were not working. Hardly could plug it in to the phone. So the seller probably switched it and kept the good ones for himself. When we recieved 2 iphones, I went to tmobile and it was not working. They matched the phone in their system and it was reported as a stolen phone but next day the seller changed it to a new one.",46,3
Apple,"The unit is associated with whoever bought them on tmobile. Using the IMEI, they can call the carrier to have this blocked. They can do this after the 120 days after you bought it here. A timeframe needed to return the item. So whoever sold me(Amazon seller: Cali-Wholesale)the unit also applied a claim for replacement on the insurance. It has been working since May until today which I no longer have service due to a blocked imei. Amazon guarantee program is currently trying to assist me with this, I will keep you posted. I advice anyone to buy at apple if you plan to keep it for peace of mind.",42,1
Apple,Great phone works very well. I'm happy ????,11,5
Apple,"this phone is blacklisted.. T-Mobile has a block on it & it was reported lost.. If T-Mobile allows me to connect the phone , I will change my review.. until then I'm very dissatisfied with your false advertising.",25,1
Apple,The seller did not state that the phone was inoperable and would require extensive COSTLY repair.,16,1
Apple,The phone was okay and new but Charger was broke when I got the phone . Need improvement to make sure device pieces work,11,3
Apple,"The shipping was rather quick (though I did pay extra for expedited), it came in a padded envelope rather than a box and without the IPhone box itself (which i don't understand as the item is listed as brand new) in addition with a charger stuffed in there, both the cable and solid wall charger which could have ended up badly. A bit more caution should have been taken in my opinion. The listing also said ""accessories"" which was false as the headphone that come with the phone were not included costing me another $32 after tax. However, when I received the phone all things seem in working order and had no issue activating it with my Verizon carrier. So far it seems to be in flawless condition visually and operationally. I shall update if anything happens with in. All and all I am happy with my purchase and will consider buying from this seller again.",67,3
Apple,"First of all, I am not an iPhone or Apple faithful. I use products based on how well they perform and suit my needs. This phone blows away the others. I had an iPhone 3, then switched to an HTC Android, then the Droid Razr. Now I'm back to the iPhone again. I like the clarity of the screen, which helps when reading text with these old eyes. The Facetime feature is great and the Verizon LTE is super fast. The screen and all of the apps are much more responsive than the iPhone 3 or any of the Android devices I've had. I'm sure another stunning Android phone will come around and I will just as likely switch again. For now, the iPhone 5 performs at every level.",48,5
Apple,The phone was delivered and all that was included in the package was physically in very good condition.... but the battery was dead and had to be immediately replaced. That was very disappointing and I believe I should have been informed before buying it...,12,1
Apple,"I bought this phone as a replacement for my iPhone 5C that had an unfortunate spin cycle in the washer when my wife washed my pants. I guess that's what happen when you make the no insurance gamble. Being faced with buying a brand new phone at full price was not exactly something I was happy about. I looked at the price for an iPhone 6 or 6S, but was not prepared to pay $800+ for a phone. Even replacing my 5C turned out to be over $400. In desperation for a replacement iPhone I began looking at used devices and came across this one which I purchased for $220. Although it was technically a downgrade from the 5C, I knew that the differences were merely cosmetic and it was well worth the potential price savings. I was a little skeptical at first, but I asked the Amazon Warehouse Deals customer service a few questions and ordered. The phone came in unofficial packaging, but with brand new official accessories. I wouldn't say the phone looked brand new, but it was in great condition. There were no scratches on the screen and very light wear on the back of the phone that was hardly noticeable. The earpiece was a little dirty, but there was no real actual damage to the device from use. I began loading my apps and programs onto the phone and using it, but within the first week I realized one thing was horribly wrong. The battery life was awful! It would not even make it past lunch time! I called customer service and was ready to ship it back. Shortly before getting it packaged and ready to go, my mother reminded me that there was a battery recall on iPhone 5s and that if it was one of the models on recall I could proabably get the battery replaced by Apple for free. I checked Apple's website and typed in the phone serial and sure enough, it was on the recall list. I reluctantly drove to the Apple store and had them check it out. After about 4 hours they replaced the battery free of charge with a brand new battery. Now the phone works as good as new! Overall, the used gamble paid off and I would definitely recommend trying a use device if you are in a similar situation. I think Amazon does need to check these devices and make sure they have Apple replace the batteries before selling them to customers though. Even though the replacement is free, it did cost me time and gas which is inconvenient.",22,4
Apple,"What can I say about the iPhone 5? My wife attempted upgrade from 4 with this Amazon seller and we received a defective phone. Be VERY careful with ""refurbished"", or ""loose"" (not in box and sealed) phones.Beware THIS seller in particular: ""Quag's Buy, Sell, Trade.""",22,5

It's not holding a charge, dies at 50% battery, won't turn on sometimes, etc. Today I took it to the Apple Store to see what might be wrong. What's wrong is that all of the Apple parts were stripped out and replaced with non-Apple parts. It looks like an iPhone, used to work like an iPhone, but Apple won't touch it with a 10 ft pole and I'm out $400.",34,1
Apple,"I ordered this iPhone because I had an unlimited data plan with Verizon and didn't want to update the contract...leaving me to buy a phone at retail cost. I figured I could save some money by purchasing a used iPhone. The phone appeared to be in good condition with limited wear and tear. I was initially please until I realized that I could only make phone calls while it was in speaker phone mode. I brought it to Apple and they couldn't repair it. I've returned it. If not for that, I would have had zero complaints, but a phone is still a phone and should be able to make a simple call.",23,2
Apple,"Described as advertised, no damage to my product. It looks as though it was a new iPhone 5. Clean IMEI number, the phone only cannot silence its camera shutter. I did some research and figured it could have been marketed for another country where it is illegal to silence the shutter function. Nonetheless this is fine. The only issue was it looks as if it came with its original battery so it was an old and almost entirely depleted battery. That was an easy fix, with a experienced local phone repair shop the battery is relatively cheap as del for older iPhone models. No issue with the new battery, when the phone was opened the internal components were without damage as well. Product was delivered in a great orderly fashion, no headphones were included, just the charger wire and wall unit piece.",11,5
Apple,"This iPhone didn't work when I bought it - Be careful before buying ""Certified Preowned Items""",25,1

Still awaiting for procedures to get my phone correctly sent as receiving a reimbursement might be a wast of resources at this point. I'm traveling and had to postpone my returning ticket so I can receive the correct item before leaving the country, very disrespectful treatment as there's no phone to contact for emergencies like this and my extra expenses as a consequence of their mistake are not being covered.",20,1

In other words certain keys where just not working. How disappointing!! They apologized and asked me to send them a receipt of my shipping charges... At first I thought ok no big deal i will just re-order another phone once I get my credit.. We returned the item expecting a full refund when two weeks later discover that they charged us $81.58 for re-stocking fee... Not acceptable for a phone that doesn't function as advertised. Not only did I lose my time and money but had to deal with the aggravation of the incompetence of this Company... Take my advice... Avoid!!!!,62,1

Apple,"This one-star review is for the iPhone 5 that was received.When you are buying used iPhones here on Amazon, beware of being sold an iCloud-Locked iphone. There is NO WAY to bypass an iCloud-Locked iphone. Being iCloud-Locked is different from having an iphone locked to a particular carrier. The iCloud-Lock is where an apple user's email & password are locked onto the iphone. You may see ""iCloud Bypass"" solutions advertised elsewhere on the internet, but they are all fake ""bypass"" ads and you will be stuck with an iCloud-Locked iphone that is essentially a bricked doorstop.Personally myself have been fortunate to have previously purchased six good iPhones (5, 4, 4, 4, 3GS, 3G) -- all of my OTHER PREVIOUS iphones, purchased here on amazon, get five stars. However, this LATEST purchase of this particular iPhone 5 turned out to be a unfortunate one-star experience because this particular iphone was iCloud-Locked. It was sold on this page as an AT&T iphone. But it was a Sprint iphone. There was no sprint sim card in the phone and therefore no way to activate it. No AT&T sim card and no Tmobile sim card would work on this Sprint iphone. So, had to separately get a special sprint sim card (SIMGLW406R) that only works on the Sprint iPhone 5. It is only when you have that sprint sim card is when you can activate this particular Sprint iPhone 5. But for this iphone, once it tried to activate, the activation screen comes up requiring someone's email and password. This iphone was iCloud-Locked!Prior to buying this iphone, myself personally sent message questions to the seller asking if this iPhone did NOT have a passcode and was NOT iCloud-Locked. The seller replied, ""Correct"".Later, in the seller's message replies after buying this iPhone, the seller tried to say this iphone was ""for repairs or parts"" -- but the seller's original description did NOT say that at all. The seller's (scottb1114) specific description for this iphone said this iphone had a cracked lcd screen, had a jammed top button, and that this iphone ""CAN BE EASILY FIXED."" Yes, the lcd screen was cracked and can be easily replaced. But, no, the top button was not jammed. Normally, an iphone in this shape can be fixed, but this iphone was iCloud-Locked and therefore was NOT ""easily fixed"". IMHO, it seems various sellers (like this particular seller: scottb1114) turn out to be either they are liars, or they do not know what they are selling, or they do not know iphones at all, or they have bad writing & reading comprehension skills. Speaking of reading comprehension skills, watch out for sellers who only read messages and email on their phones because they may not read everything you might write in a detailed email to them -- those type of sellers seem to have problems reading beyond a couple lines of text because they apparently treat everything they read as short text messages when reading on a phone.So, beware if a product description for an iphone may look attractive to you and beware if the seller is saying yes to everything you ask -- because you may really have a fifty-fifty chance of actually getting an iCloud-Locked iPhone that may also be on the wrong carrier. Although this amazon product page may be for an AT&T iPhone, various sellers may actually be trying to get away with selling Sprint iPhones or Verizon iPhones on amazon pages for an AT&T iPhone. The sprint and verizon iphones should really be on the other amazon pages that have sprint or verizon iphones. But some sellers just don't know any better or are trying to get more money because AT&T iphones sell for more. Personally, my opinion is you want an AT&T iPhone as your first choice if you are on AT&T, and then next you want a Verizon iPhone because you can put an AT&T sim card in a verizon iphone and it should work. You really do not want a Sprint iPhone because it will only work on sprint and NOT on AT&T. And then all bets are off if the iphone is icloud-locked because it will not work for you at all.The question then becomes can an iphone like this one have its iCloud-Lock be bypassed. You will have to search on the internet to find out if a bypass is actually possible. You will find people promising to do bypasses, but actually a bypass can no longer be done because Apple has really locked down the iCloud activation process.",17,1

Apple,"I bought a factory unlocked iphone 5 from this vendor while I was in the visiting friends in USA in December. When I opened the sim tray it stroke me that there was an ATT nano Sim there. Back home, I tried to activate the phone with my carrier from Argentina (Movistar) and the phone could not activate saying that my carrier's nanosim was imcompatible. So it seems like the iphone is actually locked (probably to ATT). We do not have oficial Apple Stores in my country so I'm stuck. Fortunatelly, I am travelling again to the USA in 15 days soI will book an appointment at San Francisco's Apple store to see if the can confirm that the iphone is locked and hoperfully they can swap it for an unlocked unit.I have paid more than 700 dolars and I can't use this phone. This is outrageous.AVOID!!!",130,1
Apple,"I bought this new 32GB white but I receive used 64 GB what's wrong with you? No seal, no film and the box looks so old!",87,1
Apple,"I had to write a second review for this product after using it for a week. The seller is a fake and a thief. The phone camera lens is cracked the keeps on hanging and i have to restart it over and over. The seller knew of these issues and sold them to me. My advice to all buyers never buy from this seller again she is a fake and a crook. Her explanation is that she is sorry the product did not meet my expectation, which means she knew what she was selling and thought she could get away with it. Well no horrible product like this would ever meet someoneƒ??s expectation. Please do not purchase from this seller",62,1
Apple,"I ordered an Unlocked Phone and a friend brought it to Africa where I work and when I got it here, found out it was locked. Had to send it back with another friend to get my money back.",53,1

Apple,"The phone was Defective not like they said ""used like-new, just open box to check internet"" Dropping calls and the Battery dying really fast.Plus, I also got a defective charger cable that i NEVER GOT BACK the new one from them. I don't recommend this seller AT ALL, they are selling BAD products over the internet.",39,1

Apple,"I bought Iphon5 Unlocked. The seller -Everyday Black Friday- promised that phone will be new, with established iOs6. But to me sold phone which was in the use. In a box there is no paper clip for access to a tray with Sim. Model and Imei number on a box don't correspond to numbers in phone. The seller - the deceiver.",19,1
Apple,"It happened that I would never imagine to have to return the iPhone I have bought and to ask for refund because I trusted it would be a new item, which should not have been used before.I can remember I have red in the item description at Amazon site, this iPhone was being sold as ƒ??new condition itemƒ? according to the statement announced.I stayed totally disappointed when the guy from Apple Support Department told me: - ƒ??this iPhone you bought was not a new item. It was already activated, by the end of 2012... Someone owned this phone beforeƒ?. In spite of this situation, the screen did not work. The screen was damaged as you will can observe in the attached pictures.I am so sorry to participate through this awkward situation.Regards,Eduardo Martins Santos",17,1
Apple,"The ""Unlocked"" phone it is unlocked, but unlocked to UK, HONG KONG, GERMANY, ETC. The version this is the A1429 GSM. That version will work with AT&T, and T-Mobile; but will not allow you to use LTE, only 3G in the United States. There is no Unlocked version of the phone yet to be released in the United States. So be aware of this. They just want the money, and people are buying without getting complete details of the actual item. Shady, so for that they get a 1 star. Keep in mind if you do go overseas this phone will work with the LTE there not here.AT&T: A1428 (GSM)Verizon & Sprint: A1429 (CDMA)Overseas: A1429 (GSM) <----- the one on this page..",192,1
Apple,"this ad says in the description ""Item model number: A1429"" .. what i received A1428!!there is difference between the two models! i wouldn't made the purchase if they said it's A1428!",60,1
Apple,"First, the imei number on the box DOES NOT match the one on the phone. Second, on the box it says it's a ""16gb"" iphone while it is actually a 64gb one. Third, there is a scratch on the iphone!!! See my picture attached below. Thought it's not a major one but it could mean some body damage inside this phone. Furthermore, there's bubble in the protective screen film which is really uncommon for a new phone.One more thing, the battery is out when I received the phone. I owned almost a dozen of Apple products and none of them had ZERO battery when I received it.And most importantly!!! After 20 minutes charging, I couldn't even open it!",10,1
Apple,"This Iphone was a replacement for my non-smart phone and 64gb Ipod touch.It's slim enough to fit into your pocket with the right protector and is very, very light.I can get the battery to last a full day with moderate data usage, some calling, and a bunch of text messages.I went the unlocked route with a monthly carrier, and am going to save over $1000 in 2 years when compared to a 2-year contracted carrier.Headphone jack is on the left underside, and not the right side like the 4th generation.Camera is great with an auto-focus feature, editing, and great resolution.There is a switch right above the volume controls on the left side of the device that changes the phone from vibrate to ringer or vice versa, which has come in handy quite a few times just in the past few weeks.Replacing/changing the SIM card is difficult and requires an unbent paper clip to push an release the clipping mechanism on the right side of the phone.Volume and clarity of phone calls meet and exceed my expectations.The Siri voice commands are a neat feature. I have used it when hands weren't very free to text. Just make sure environmental noise isn't very prominent in comparison to your voice, otherwise Siri will just keep thinking and never come up with any text. (from my experiences at least)The ease of operation and speed at which the Iphone performs tasks is considerably quick in my opinion.Overall, I am super satisfied with this particular Iphone!Would recommend getting it if you're already on the verge of wanting one, have high familiarity with the Ipod touch, like a very user friendly interface, or like Apple products in general.Thanks for listening!",38,5
Apple,The above distributors sold me an I phone 5 that had already been returned to them since it was defective.The I phone arrived to me with the SIM card of the earlier customer.The I phone's sound was bad and its speed mediocre compared to the one my daugther has . I paid nearly 1000 dolalrs for this unlocked phone WorldWide Distributors .Since I travel a lot I was not able to return it on time and the 30 days passed . WorldWide Distributors refuses to deal with me anymore.BEWARE OF ITEMS Sold by WorldWide Distributors...they coud be defective as my i phone 5 is.,35,1
Apple,"I totally love the phone but was deeply upset when I found that the phone shipped to me came with an AT&T nano SIM and I was unable to use my Ethiopian and Afghan SIM cards. I plan to have an actual ""UNLOCKED"" 64GB IPhone 5 shipped to me since I paid astronomical prices and received a useless locked version.",13,1
Apple,"Phone is great condition and working order as described. No issues at all with purchase, very pleased overall with phone.",57,5
Apple,"Iphone 5c is basically an Iphone 5 with a colorful plastic case which makes it about a $100 cheaper (regular Iphone 5 and 5s is metal and plastic). Outside of the colorful plastic you really won't notice the difference between this, the iphone 5 and the iphone 5s unless you're REALLY knit picky. I'm a Samsung guy who stayed away from the Iphone for years due to the small size of the phones, I decided to try this one out because of the price and that it is relatively similar in size to a smaller Samsung phone like the Galaxy Victory I had before and it hasn't been that big a deal to switch over (so far).I wanted to take the time to address some of the negative reviews regarding purchasing these phones as many come from user error. If you're going to buy a used phone from a 3rd party vendor be sure to read the description of the phone on that specific venders profile and not the Amazon listed one (which is for a new phone). The one I bought was refurbished but the vender (mybullfrog) listed specifically what it came with (charger and cable), the condition of the phone (near great condition with perfect screen) and what it didn't come with (a sim card). Putting that together basically this phone was a warranty exchange because the previous owner dropped it and cracked the screen and they just replaced it for them with a new phone, fixed the screen on the other phone and is reselling it. I got it exactly 3 days from when it was shipped and it was exactly as described (picture included).When you buy a used phone with a sim card already in you run the risk of getting a phone that won't be able to be activated as that phone could possibly still be active on someone else's account (a regular complaint on low scored reviews).When you buy a phone without the Sim you have to get the Sim from the network provider of the phone (in this case Sprint). If you don't know this information it can be a hassle which accounts for most of the complaints. If you go to a corporate Sprint store (IE a store that does in store phone repairs) they do carry Sim cards there and shouldn't charge you for them if you're activating the phone at their store (though they're less than $4 if they do). If you just go to a regular Sprint store generally they won't have spare Sim cards and will look at you funny.Anyway so far so good, I checked everything out, got phone calls, sent and received texts, watched TV on aps, used the headphone jack and it all worked perfectly. So far no complaints from me.",55,5
Apple,Nice phone as described.....quick shipping!! Connected to Sprint without an issue...just needed a SIM Card from Sprint....No problems at all :-),54,5

Apple,"very pleased with this purchase. I was skeptical buying a previously owned iphone but just couldnt see paying full price for a brand new one since we werent eligible for an upgrade yet. It was a gift for my daughter for christmas. It was in such good shape with the box and all, she had no idea it was previously owned.",27,5
Apple,Love my new IPhone and it was a great price there was a small issue with the phone and the seller didn't have a replacement in my color.,22,5

Apple,"I'm an Android person, got an I-phone 4 and HATED it, decided I'd be an Android person forever, but then I thought I'd try this and I really like it. With all the changes and updates it does most of the Android stuff, easier to clean up memory, the only thing it's missing is Swype.",20,5
Apple,It is less expensive than the iphone 5s and I bought it with no contract to replace the iphone 4s that she had. She loves it and I think the phone looks nice and sleek.,17,5

Apple,I was a little leery but it was a brand new phone and no problems at all activating and getting AT&T to switch the sim to this new phone.,46,5

Apple,I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,13,5
Apple,Love it. Works well no problems with this phone and I like all the features. Recommended to some of my friends who have Samsung.,15,5
Apple,"Even though the phone was advertised as unlocked, it was not unlocked. The phone came with an AT&T SIM and worked fine the first time I turned it on. However, when I used my T-Mobile SIM it kept saying ""invalid sim"". I tried it two other GSM sim from a different country too. If you are buying it to use with any other carrier than AT&T please dont buy. With Amazon's great customer service policy, I was able to return it. But doesnt worth all the hassle",127,1
Apple,"Order this phone on Dec 2014. Was fine for a while. Then one day. The phone becomes locked and now unable to use it with the carrier I want... I thought this was unlocked....

Apple,"The phone was locked to At&T only. I had purchased the phone to use on the T-Mobile network. Since the phone was new I tried to unlock the phone through AT&T's website. Since I didn't have the phone on the AT&T network for 6 months they could't unlock the phone for me. Not a problem with their policy but a problem with the person who sold me the phone and said that it was already unlocked. Sheesh, what a waste of my time.",43,1
Apple,This phone is nice i just got one for my daughter but wen it came the charger didn't work I had to go buy a new one,32,4
Apple,The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,21,1
Apple,"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones.

Apple,Thank you for the wonderful phone. I was giving this phone as a gift and I really appreciate the great service,14,4
Apple,"I'm more than happy with my iPhone 5c. I was able to transfer my data from the 3g easily. I bought an AT&T SIM card and was able to activate the new phone via Chat with an AT&T rep. Now I can take advantage of LTE service. I like the new interface and ease of use; I'm impressed with the 5c's camera, too.",10,5
Apple,AT&T says this phone I bought was reported stolen.,17,1
Apple,This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint,124,1
Apple,"I was a little skeptical at first about buying this phone from amazon because i got it at the price $499 (brand new!! Sealed) but i couldn't be happier! The phone of course is running ios 7 straight from the box and the touch i.d is probably the best thing ever. If you're debating whether to get the 5c or 5s definitely spend a little more for the 5s its totally worth it. The camera is great. Extremely fast and extremely clear. There are new options on it like the slomo effect which is fun to play with. The dual tone flash takes mobile picture taking to a whole other level. The best camera on a phone in the market. Take that from someone who has had a galaxy note 2 and samsung galaxy s3. The screen size is something people might not want to over look. If you have extremely big hands i would say go in store and try it out, see how well you can operate it. But its definitely ""one handable"" meaning you can use it with only one hand and not ever have to over stretch. The resolution is crystal clear, no doubt about that. Although the phone is 1.2 ghz it is blazing fast. It is a 64 bit. I can play heavy games like GTA and not ever freeze on me, even with lots of apps running in the background. Battery life is as expected when dealing with apple. But one thing i have noticed standby times are incredibly great. I can go to sleep with my phone at 100% and wake up and its at 99% sometimes still 100%. This phone is not ""droppable"" you'll have lucky moments when you drop it and it doesn't shatter but if it falls too high and too hard or at the wrong angle, your screen will be gone. Though I've had mine for over a month I haven't cracked it because i always keep it in a case. So invest in something protective like a speck case or otterbox or some generics.",56,5
Apple,Doesn't work for tmobile at all. Tried to put the SIM card in and it won't read itDon't buy this phone.,55,1
Apple,I love this phone! I cut my original Sim card that was in my Samsung Galaxy and put it in the new Iphone 5s and it works great.Internet responds super fast and the fingerprint unlock is amazing. Condition is perfect and it came in the original box. I'm very happy with my purchase.,10,5
Apple,"Not for American use. Japanese tmobile. Not the right model. Took forever to get it, send it back, and get my refund.",47,1
Apple,Horrible the battery sucksss! Very disappointed with my purchase,11,1
Apple,Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,28,1
Apple,"Scam, the phone was barred off the network after 1 week due to ""Unpaid payments in the T-Mobile payment plan"", returned immediately to amazon. I'm very disappointed.",26,1
Apple,"This phone was bought as a birthday gift.(I didnt open the package to inspect because I assumed it was new and nothing to worry about. It was sealed in plastic) The first thing the birthday girl noticed was the dust under the screen, stickers everywhere and the knock off charger. She over looked it because the phone worked. Two days later the phone stopped working and she asked if the phone was used. After taking the phone into tmobile together, they confirmed the phone was used and the imei # is blocked from their network (that means either stolen/owing money/fraud). In other words they cant help me and I should return it. Went home to pack the phone back in the box and arrange to return it then I noticed the stickers I mentioned earlier were actually meant to hide info on the box. Long story short, the box is not for this phone. The imei on the sticker is different to the one on the box. So this seller got an old box, printed stickers to match the imei/specs of the phone and placed it over the info on the box. Do not buy from this person. If you do make sure to ask for that IMEI first. Here's some pictures just in case they plan to re-sell the same phone without being honest. I blacked out the end of the imei for security reasons but it's clear the both numbers don't match. Worst purchase ever!!!!!",49,1
Apple,"I purchased the gold 16 GB variation of the iPhone 5s and it is so beautiful for a device. The gold color on the back is very light, more like a champagne color, but it's a very unique and unseen color for any phone, which makes, whoever buys it, stand out and unique. it's an iPhone, so that only means that it's synonymous with greatness! I love the new, fresh OS that came preloaded on the device, and the hardware is excellent too, especially the newly-debuted fingerprint reader. This phone is just downright simplistic and user-friendly that even your nana or grandpa can use it.",15,5
Apple,"Very happy with this 5S 64GB iPhone. We had expected the prices on the 5S 64GB to drop significantly after the iPhone 6 came out. But the issues with the iPhone 6 immediately after launch caused the 5S 64GB to stay in demand. We were happy to find it here, and at a good price. We activated it on Verizon, and Verizon provided the SIM Card at no charge. They said that they always provide free SIM Cards at their Verizon Corporate stores. Reviews that mention the fact that you need to get a SIM Card to go with this phone may be unaware that Verizon customers can take it to a Verizon Corporate store to have it activated and get the SIM Card at no charge.",88,5
Apple,"My iPhone arrived sealed in the box. Everything was perfect! I needed mine for Verizon Wireless, so I can't say if it was unlocked or not. The phone had all the accessories it was supposed to come with and everything works well. I am pleased!",81,5
Apple,"The phone turned out to be a Verizon phone, and was not ""unlocked"" to be used on other networks.This was definitely false advertizing and currently struggling to return it for full refund...do to traveling.",10,1
Apple,"This phone is very good, it is new, no one used, data line and a full range of headphones, the seller is also very careful, phone also is equipped with a Verizon phone card to the buyer after receiving the phone, although the delivery later than expected for several days, but the seller attitude is very sincere to apologize to me and explanation, like this phone, and like the seller deals!",32,5
Apple,Verizon indicates that the phone is not compatible with their system,13,1

Yes, it is a world phone, factory unlocked by VERIZON... You can take this any place, & to drop in a SIM CARD it will WORK... Great company, they gave allot of information to me, & a place to cal for anything wrong, NO PROBLEMS, NONE, AT ALL...

YES, & NO (contracts) with (anybody) but, I can take it to Anybody,, HAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!",13,5
Apple,"I was very nervous about buying an expensive item from Amazon, but I gave it a try and DO NOT regret it! I got my package in record time and it was exactly, if not better, than what I was hoping.",16,5
Apple,"I purchased an iPhone 5s from MassTechtronics, and I am very unsatisfied. The Post said that there were no problems with the phone. When I got the phone, it already had problems. It keeps freezing up, and turning off. Every time I try to text someone, it tries to do the typing itself. Any time I am on social media, it Scrolls through the posts and likes things by itself. To fix it, I have to lock and unlock the screen every few seconds. Most of the time, I can't even unlock the screen. I have to restart the phone sometimes.",12,1
Apple,"Although the description did not say so, these phones (I bought 2) were shipped without SIM cards. I am told that this is usual for phones sold on Amazon or e-Bay, although I have no idea why this should be true for new phones.This caused me considerable trouble, as the 3 area Sprint stores I called claimed they did not have any SIM cards for the Apple iPhone 5s, but they could order them and probably get them in in 2-3 weeks. One store quoted me a price of $35 per SIM card, and another wanted $36. I was also told that I could not get the Sprint SIM cards I needed at an Apple store. This was NOT acceptable, but if you read Sprint forums online, it appears that it is not unusual. The Sprint stores REALLY want you to buy your phone from them, not Amazon, or Apple, or elsewhere...and they offer the 16GB 5s at the full retail price of $649.99 (plus tax, of course).Luckily, I had also called Apple Tech Support about the problem of the missing SIM cards (1-888-My-Apple). They called the local Apple store while I was on the phone with them, and informed me that not only did the Apple store have the Sprint SIMs in stock, but that they would provide them to me free of charge. Now that's better.We were able to easily install the SIM cards and then take the phones to the local Sprint store to have them activated (you can no longer do this online, unfortunately). This was a very long process because we wanted to keep our current phone numbers, but eventually we were able to get everything squared away.Moral of the story: buy the phone from Amazon (great deal), call Apple Tech support, procure a SIM card, install it, and THEN and ONLY THEN, consult Sprint.",126,5

I was on the Boost Sprint network which had spotty coverage in my area.verizon has a $45 pre paid plan which is working quite well for me so far.now to the iPhone 5 s: I really like the 4 inch screen, the iPhone fits in my hand and it is easier to navigate all the apps. I find typing with the keyboard much easier. I always had trouble using the keyboard on my galaxy s3, even with different keyboards. the iPhone is not as customizable as android but I can live with that. so far, the battery has lasted over 2 days and is still at 32%. this is since I activated it 2 days ago.True, I am still setting it up but I will manually sync my iPhone with iTunes. my android phone was driving me nuts, always updating several times a day from google play. my battery lasted around 1 1/2 to 2 days. if the iPhone is similar, I will be happy. all in all I am very pleased with my new, pre owned iPhone 5s. buying from amazon warehouse or fulfilled by amazon is the way to go!",10,5
Apple,"SHAME ON ""Solid PUrchases"" as a shipping company. I placed my order on 2/7/2014, and received a dirty used phone on 2/19/2014. It was shipped in just a flimsy soft envelope, with a bit of bubble wrap. It certainly should have been shipped in a small box! The apple box was previously opened and the corner smashed. The phone was covered with greasy fingerprints. All the attachments, except the cheap earbuds were missing. No info or operating instructions. There is no identification if it is an 15s, or 15, or locked or not.Now I have to wait up to three days to obtain approval from ""Solid (Crap) Purchases"" to return it, and wait again for a refund.. Other shipping companies associated with Amazon have better wrapped and cared more in delivering a $10 item, in comparison to a fragile new apple iphone costing several hundred dollars. I will never purchase anything from ""Solid Purchases"" again. Avoid the big disappoint I am experiencing, and consider selecting another shipper.",81,2
Apple,"Shipping was quick, product was brand-new in original box very happy with my purchase ..",11,5
Apple,The phone itself is great. But this phone is NOT UNLOCKED for other carriers. It is an ATT phone and it would not register and I couldn't get a SIMS card to activate with any other carrier. I spent plenty of time trying. I feel cheated for trusting product description and advertisement.,36,2

Apple,Actually 0 stars. DO NOT BUY. They LIE. Claim the phone is new. It started freezing after a month. Convenient for them. I contact Apple. Lo and behold the phone is KNOWN AS DEFECTIVE. Now they won't refund because of the time. They also won't post a truthful review on their site if it's not glowing. BEWARE!,29,1
Apple,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at first. I only purchased this phone because my son really wanted one for his birthday and I could not afford the $450 it usually costs. So I took a leap of faith and I am glad I did. The phone did have a few scratches on it, but none on the screen itself, and my son didn't seem to care. To hook it up, all I did was take it to T-mobile (my cell phone carrier) and got sim card that fit it. After putting the in sim, it took me through the usual new cell phone set up and then it was good to go. Overall, I am pleased with the phone and my son absolutely loves it.",12,5

I was very excited to learn the iPhone was getting a bigger screen, but when I learned there was two choices, immediately I was torn between getting the 6 or the Plus. I went as far as making a paper cutout with exact dimensions and going to a store to mess with the Galaxy Note 3 as they are similar in size (this was before the iPhone release). I ended up going with the iPhone 6 Plus and pre-ordered it, followed by the iPhone 6 a few weeks after launch for my wife.The first thing I must admit is everything about this phone is amazing. There are no 90* angles, no rough edges, no flaw on the phone. Everything is smooth and looks gorgeous. The screen is crystal clear, it is extremely light, and it just feels great. The size of the screen is massive - it honestly is bigger than you can imagine without actually holding it in your hand. The increase in size over the older models and even the 6 is excellent for watching movies, reading books, surfing the web, using Facebook, and much more. Having the extra screen size allows you to use your email and text app in landscape mode, which is helpful. Everything was great for me, at first. I found the more I used it, especially for longer durations in the day, it becomes quite uncomfortable to hold in your hand all day, especially if you text or email a lot. Unless you have a massive hand, one handed iPhone use is most certainly a think of the past.",36,5
Apple,Seller is amazing. Phone was new and would definitely buy a device from this seller again.,20,5
Apple,paid the money phone never made home. It was horrible experience and the person never emailed me back. I emailed 4 times. Do NOT buy phone from this!!,13,1
Apple,"The phone is nice, great shape. BUT, it is not compatible with Sprint as it says it is. It is a GSM phone. This made it more of a hassle than I was expecting. Was not worth the headache since I could've easily chosen another and been good to go with a simple SIM swap.",15,1
Apple,This is the first negative review I have ever written. The phone was expensive and when it arrived not only was it so scratched up on the screen (definitely not normal wear and tear) but the phone did not work! Callers could not hear me. Very frustrating experience and first time I had a bad experience ordering through Amazon.,17,1
Apple,"I purchased this phone from an unlocked phone classification under.. but the seller did not indicate the phone is locked in relevant page.it can not be use under other networks,,",63,1
Apple,"The iphone 6 is great. Better deal to by from Amazon then get service, vs. getting trapped in a contract. I have the $50 plan with sprint and that's it!",10,5
Apple,I can't put The sim ! Because the phone has been reported lost so it can't be activated!And I try to write to my seller she didn't answer me !,27,1
Apple,"Told me the phone is unlocked by email, but can not use it oversea, i checked it , it is locked, it is not be trusted.",21,1
Apple,"The phone was amazing! My crush loved it!' Worked perfectly . She liked taking selfies with it too '. She activated it with T-Mobile even though it's from AT&T. So, you can probably activate it with any carrier. HAS to be a GOOD store . Not the small stores .",10,5
Apple,box came empty,10,1
Apple,I saved nearly $200 and a lot of tax buying from here. Got an iPhone 6s and it is working perfectly! Looks brand new. The order came in 3 days too. Highly recommend,10,5
Apple,"Works perfectly, I haven't had any problems with it so far.",10,5
Apple,Showed up FAST!! Works perfectly and it's a lot more affordable then buying a new one. Very pleased with my purchase.,39,5
Apple,"I love this product, I received mine with a bit of scratches on the back of the phone but it works perfectly.",22,4
Apple,"Only had this phone a few days now it arrived quick and the phone is fast hooked up to my wifi with no problem, we had an iphone five and we were able to activate this one by switching the two without going into the store. A piece of cake for my son, so far it's a great buy looks good no added contrac time,real nice phone.",21,5
Apple,So far I have been completely satisfied with the product. It was within two days everything in the phone is functioning completely well and up to date. I would recommend this other buyers this deserves its 5 stars. They're very professional and nice.,17,5
Apple,Perfect,14,5
Apple,"Was a little skeptical about this purchase but received the product and it highly exceeded my expectations. No scratches, looks brand new. I will definitely order from this seller again! I am very satisfied with my purchase at a great price!!",15,5
Apple,"I have to say that I'm very disappointed with this purchase. I received the phone and on the description it said it had minor cosmetic issues. When I received the phone, the phone actually had tremendous scratches on the main screen and a huge dent on the back. I wish I knew the cosmetic damage was more intense, I would've spent the extra $200 to get a brand-new phone. I'm not satisfied with this and I hope that the seller reads this and confine some happy medium with their customer.",10,1
Apple,Very disappointed.,36,1
Apple,"I just received the phone earlier today and I was very much disheartened. As soon as I opened the package and inspected the phone, I noticed that the screen had been replaced. And the new screen replacement had been done very poorly and funny! Whatever they used to stick the screen to the phone was visible from outside. You can see the ""glue"" from the outside of the phone. Secondly, the LCD Screen wasn't even properly mounted/aligned to the phone. It was quite slanted or out of line with the phone. Don't need a phone like this.",33,2
Apple,"Item was as expected, luv it. Great seller, this phone was unopened and easy to set up with AT&T. Would buy from this seller again.",13,5
Apple,This phone was supposed to be unlocked according to my purchase details and it was not. I had to pay additional $50 USD to unlock this phone. I am very angry with this product.,19,1
Apple,Very unhappy phone only worked for about a week and a half. Then it started having a lot technical problems. It first started with the screen showing everything very uneven. Can not even tell faces off. The finger print button never work. Etc. Seller refused to exchange or refund. A lot of money thrown away. Upsetting.,16,1
Apple,"I took the chance on buying a refurbished phone since I did see mainly good reviews for this product, however I was left very disappointed. My iPhone came with some scratches near the volume button along with near the charging port. Aside from that, my battery was in very poor condition dying whenever it would reach 20%. I did all the troubleshooting suggested thinking it was maybe the software, but the problem continued. I wouldn't waste your money. You are better off buying a brand new unlocked iphone from Apple for just $30 more. Not worth the hassle.",156,1
Apple,Oops unboxing fail ????,156,2
Apple,"Only worked for 5 days before it completely broke. The creen starts flickering black and white checkers, lines, and boxes. For the first 3 days, I could just reset it and it would be good as new but after day 4 I can't even get the screen to clear of the glitch. Extremely disappointed I spent so much on something that didn't even last a week. Don't waste your money.",36,1
Apple,"Extremely pleased with this purchase, at first I thought it was too good to be true but I made the Order and it was here in a matter of days and works very well no problems yet",20,5
Apple,Wow was so happy and blessed to purchase this phone looked all over could find cheaper the phone works very well and we used Metro PC carrier too thanks so much to the seller excellent condition too,26,5
Apple,"I was so excited when I received my phone, but when I started using it everything went left. It was stated that everything was reset and working as if it was new but that was a lie. When I receive calls people can't even hear me even if I am shouting and my home button is loose as if it was tampered with. I never bad experience with Amazon. I am always cautious when I am purchasing things I read the reviews and everything, but this time I was got I assume even though I was really cautious like always. So disappointed!! Please be careful!",12,1
Apple,That came instade of the phone that i buight,119,1
Apple,"I want to retrieve the money, I have been fake iphone plus 6",103,1
Apple,This is a fake iphone. Fake buttons and loose. Different sized. No flash. No real spot for a sim card. Hand cut apple logo. Beware!,34,1
Apple,Buyer beware I bought a stolen phone! Do not buy iPhones off of Amazon. Go through Apple att etc!!!! It was not factory sealed and the device was a stolen product.,26,1
Apple,"This is messed up. I don't know what happened but my phone which i ordered from Gretailer was the 64GB, and i received the 16GB. The big surprise is that i found some mud inside the the iPhone 6 plus box so instead of finding the phone i found mud, can you believe that.",23,1
Apple,I was a scam! When I opened the box I found nothing inside..,23,1
Apple,Phone looked great!! Looked almost brand new. Everything was packaged beautifully and even came with headphones and a charger!,21,5
Apple,"When this iPhone 6 Plus arrived the shipping package wasn't secured, It was folded over like a 1970's sandwich bag! The box was filthy and stained! It had none of apples silver logo's imprinted on the box and didn't come with the manual that all NEW apple phone come with. After some research on refurbished and used phones it was more than evident that the phone wasn't ""new"" at all!The sim tray didn't have the serial # imprinted on it, the original serial # stickers were missing from the box and the serial # showed inaccurate date of manufacturer in conjunction with phone model! Absolutely not as desribed!Apple iPhone 6 Plus 128GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Cell Phone - Space Gray",39,1
Apple,"The phone came still used on a previous person's Itunes account. Which I already tells me it was not ""new"" as advertised.It however was in mint condition but it leads me to believe it may have been opened or had a battery tampered with. Also the box did not come sealed and had a aftermarket knock off cable.But all in all it is still a great working phone with a solid serial that performs and does everything I need with a great display.Bang for buck this phone will do for 530$.",10,4
Apple,This phone was locked to another account and I wasn't able to activate it,12,1
Apple,I couldn't activate the phone which sucks!!,18,1
Apple,I ordered the Silver iPhone 6s 64 GB from FGS Trading. The phone came in good time. It was indeed internationally unlocked and worked in Jamaica. The phone is beautiful and works great! Would definitely recommend!!!,13,5
Apple,3 Days using it. The iphone started shutting off while the battery was 90% battery. This iphone is defective,83,1
Apple,"Be warned. This phone is not unlocked. I entered a foreign GSM sim into the phone and got a message that the SIM is not allowed per the current ""activation policy"".",44,1
Apple,"It LOOKS new and good, but the battery is not good at all. The description says new for this phone but it is clearly not. The battery barely lasts 6 hours. And on the off chance it decides to lasts longer, it dies at 50% or 40%. Very disappointed with this product. Should have just bought a new one because it looks like I will have to replace the battery on this one and spend about as much as I would have to buy it new. I do not recommend buying this. They make it look nice on the outside",33,1
Apple,"I bought this phone before few days and it's tottaly broken and screen doesn't work. On first look it was good, but after few days the problems comes out. Screen is shaking, moving left and right without touch, and it's not accurate. I'm going to refund and I'm tottaly disappointed, also I didn't get accessories and charger is not original.",11,1
Apple,Had been using the phone for a month and all of a sudden service disappeared. It turned out the phone was probably bought in a contract or smth and then sold to me and ultimately blocked i was said that by apple store worker. The price seems like so slow so people are bought it but be careful u might have same.,11,1
Apple,"It's definitely worthy, works like new and the item is in a very good condition!!! Definitely recommended!!!",20,5
Apple,"It came earlier like a week than expected. Had no scratches or signs of drops or anything. It's like new! Thank you so much for this phone, best price ever! And the camera is amazing",20,5
Apple,"I never bought a Refurbished Apple product in my life. It took me 2 weeks to decide if I should buy this Refurbished iPhone or buy a new one, and after 2 weeks me and my girlfriend we decided to buy it. I bought it for her, and when it arrived we were shocked. It was in excellent conditions, like a New one. We will never regret that we bought this product, and thank you for the excellent quality.",13,5
Apple,"I bought this and after I started using it, it will completely shut off around 45%. So I'm not very happy with it because my iPhone 5 did the same thing hence why I bought the 6s",14,1
Apple,"My iPhone is not working, say not service, is not unlocked and you don't send me the headphones! Today is back the phone. I think is not just because i pay for a good product and is not working!",14,1
Apple,"?ÿI recently decided to finally enter the 21st century and get a smartphone. My first choice was an Android phone that was slow and not user friendly at all. Meanwhile, I visited two friends who each had iPhones and were getting along famously. I knew what I needed to do.I picked up this refurbished one from BREED. It's in perfect condition! It came with only the charging cord which was expected and I'm fine with that. I did make the mistake of neglecting to get a nano SIM card. See, I'm home all the time and I only wanted to use it for various apps like for a fitbit, and texting while at home, plus the pictures and video features. I got my own free phone number through Google Play and can text through Hangouts, all without a plan. So I didn't think I'd need a SIM.I learned quickly that a SIM is needed to get to the home screen on an iPhone. So make sure you do that! I picked up a T-Mobile card that had no contract. I popped it in and I was good to go.This works beautifully! I feel so spoiled now, especially after using an inferior phone. I highly recommend picking one up from BREED especially. They did a great job with refurbishing this phone.",17,5
Apple,"Unbelieveable!!!! I need to get in touch with you ASAP. The phone is NOT UNLOCKED!!!! I want to die! Im going back to my country Today with an useless phone. I tried it with my Metro PCS sim card and it does not work!! I researched online and the ""mobile data network"" option doesnt appear. Please contact me at my email right away. And also... It came without the accesories...",296,1
Apple,It was locked and under some one's contract with an unpaid bill.I didn't like it - complete waste of time,64,1
Apple,I complained about the battery (Because i have to charge it everyday at least 2 or 3 times) and the seller has done nothing about it.,58,1
Apple,Horrible doesnt come with all the accessories and the phone is locked to at&t,10,1
Apple,"Phone I received is gold so I will be exchanging as I want Space Grey. However, the phone looks to be brand new and not refurbished and also the accessories included are real Apple accessories! Save yourself $100 off retail and buy here!",52,4
Apple,Arrived with a phone that has a drained battery. The battery drops 20 percent every 2 hours on light use. Had to return it.,32,1
Apple,Phone would not charge. Had to send back.,11,1
Apple,My iphone came like new. The screen has zero scratch and works perfectly.,11,5
Apple,"It wasn't unlocked, and the box and accessories were cheap and low quality.",12,1
Apple,"I dont want my money back, i want my phone",12,1
Apple,"The phone was exactly what I was hoping for, no problems at all and it was like new.",19,5
Apple,"DONT order this phone. The battery life drops fast even if I leave it in airplane mode! I trusted ""factory refurbished"" but won't do so again...",14,1
Apple,"I bought iPhone 6s 16gb, only to get something that looks like a pump or something.",136,1
Apple,THIS CELL ARRIVE OPEN,10,1
Apple,"THIS IS SCAM !I ordered an iPhone 6s 16GB ""New - Brand New ! Sealed!"" but i recieved an used phone which does not even work.It turned on just once, 3D touch wasn't responding that well and Phone is completely dead now.I'm not even sure if this phone is apple's real&original product.Amazon is refusing to replace an item and also problems about refund.I'm soo dissapointed.",34,1
Apple,Says unlocked I received a lock phone,73,1
Apple,I received purchased one of the iPhone 6s 16GB and recieved clays and rocks in the box.,29,1
Apple,Got the box with all accessories but NO IPHONE!!!,74,1
Apple,Phone came in a sealed box as advertised. Sim card removal tool missing and an active AT&T sim card in it. Waiting to hear from the company about a resolution. Amazon makes plenty of money! Seems to me they should weed the crooks out of their site. My last two purchases have been terrible experiences. And as the way of the world nowadays-----No One seems to take responsibility! Always someone else's fault.,25,1
Apple,"No carrier can active this phone, this phone was reported lost and stolen.",83,1
Apple,Phone took 4 hours to activate at Verizon and They had to end up calling APPLE to get the phone going! Ridiculous...was not happy,11,1
Apple,Second day after receiving the phone it froze and wasn't working. I took it to the Apple Store and was informed that it was preowned and was purchased last year. Pre owned iphone are fine but it clearly says that it's suppose to be new and the price is for a new phone. Do not buy from here. I will be returning my purchase.,43,1
Apple,"is not an iphone, i bought a FAKE IPHONE.",10,1
Apple,Come one... Money doesn't easily we need ... I need my money back... You said unlocked and sent me locked mone and with a simcard inside (like used phone). In my country I can not use that; the phone can not be used with my national SIM card,76,1
Apple,I got a Locked and a wrong Color phone,10,1
Apple,"First of all box was open and package was also . I did not receive a iPhone I received a empty box no accesories but more important no iPhone 6s I want my refund asap. I was expecting my iPhone because I am I need of a phone because I will be going to college soon . But, I did not receive no iPhone I will be requesting my refund .",50,1
Apple,I order an Iphone 6s Unlocked 64GB and all i got was a Iphone5s empty box with no phone and a cheap cheap charger.,27,1
Apple,I am not going to talk about the iPhone 6S per se because everyone knows is the best smartphone out there. I just want to assure anyone how is buying this iPhone that it comes COMPLETELY UNLOCKED that it works perfectly in basically any part of the world (I use mine in COSTA RICA) and that all you need to do is remove the Verizon sim card and place your sim card at that's all. PLEASE BE ADVISED: This international unlocked model comes WITHOUT the Sim Card Removal Tool so don't think that because of this it's a counterfeit phone. You can find this tool anywhere so no problem in that matter. This iPhone model is the A1688 one and it's called the GLOBAL one because is the model that it's most widely use in the world.,12,5
Apple,"There is a password on the phone it came in a dirty scratched box, no head phones and a dirty bunched up charger. When you are paying this much for something you expect it to look clean in a nice box and with the original accessorizes and no password.",90,1
Apple,"Poor quality control. It was wiped, but was still registered to the prior owner. I contacted the seller (Breed), and they would not replace for another unit. I would not trust this seller.",81,1
Apple,very deep scratches!! not as good as it says! hate it! I bought a 5s from another seller and it came as new.,16,1
Apple,I was sold a fake phone. The IMEI number is not even registered with Apple in the USA. The IMEI and model numbers in the box did not match the settings on the phone. The storage size was 16gb and not 64gb. What a rip off!,54,1
Apple,This is not a factory sealed phone as advertised. It is in a plastic bag.,11,1
Apple,I cant believe this phone didnt come with a charger. No return label in the shipping box. soo disapointing.,10,1
Apple,"I got a stolen phone, and doesn't work with with my provider. I checked this in T-Mobile url: [...] I need a solution to this.",43,1
Apple,"This phone is the second order from this seller. First one was not an unlocked, I returned it.And also this is not an unlocked phone unfortunately...!It is described as an unlocked. Why?? Is waste of time for me, I am very anxious...!If you need an unlocked phone look for an other seller.",13,1
Apple,Thisphone is not unlocked my friend can't use it.,10,1
Apple,"I have had my certified refurbished Unlocked iPhone 6s Plus 128GB for about two weeks now and am very pleased. The phone arrived quickly and came in a plain white box with a charger (no headphones, but I didn't expect any). I almost returned it because it was labeled a ""Verizon"" iPhone, but I popped in my AT&T sim card and it worked like a charm (LTE worked too). The back of the phone was flawless, but I noticed some minor scratches on the screen. They are not noticeable when the screen is on, so it doesn't bother me. Plus I knew I was getting a refurbished phone and not a brand new one, so the scratches didn't surprise me too much. The battery life on the phone so far is fantastic. I am able to go two days without charging my phone. I was worried about the battery being in poor shape, but it is working great. If you're on the fence about buying one of these certified refurbished phones, I say go for it. The price is great. Just don't expect a spotless phone. Anyone who looks at my iPhone does not notice the scratches and thinks it is brand new. It is only when you get up really close and examine the screen that you notice minor scratches.",42,4
Apple,"I was hesitant to purchase a refurb'd iPhone, but i must say, the unit arrived flawless. Aside from a paper sticker on the back (easily removed) and the less then stellar packaging, it was indiscernible from a new phone. I charged it fully and after a day of use the battery was still at 90% - granted I don't spend all day on calls, but am I heavy data user. So the battery is as new as well. Note that the charger and cable were included, but no earphones. But I don't care much, as I wouldn't want earphones that have been in a strangers ears. All in all, VERY pleased. Buy SPRY was the reseller mine came from.",11,5
Apple,This product came with scratches on the back cover which was disappointing because I was expecting top quality,30,2
Apple,"came in new condition, would recommend ????",26,5
Apple,So I bought this from the seller breed I bought the iPhone 6s Plus 128gb version for 649.99 I have had it for about 2 weeks and so far the phone is great software wise which I wasn't worried about.the phone game in a white box that said refurbished it included the charger cable and phone no earphones it had a plastic film on it and was in perfect condition on the back no marks or scratch on the back or side the front however is littered with micro scratches hundreds of them this phone probably belonged to some lady who just throw it in her purse with all her keys only one scratch about 1mm long is actually visible when the screen is on especially when displaying white all the other scratches are invisible when the screen is on so overall it's in 9/10 condition and is worth the 650 compared to the 799 for it brand new,13,4
Apple,"Where is my phone? In the box just charger , not phone",13,1
Apple,"The phone was good,but it didnt came with charger neither data cable",10,3
Apple,"This product come in perfect condition, with original charger and unlocked, I recomend100%",15,5
Apple,Just got my phone in the mail yesterday. I have not one complaint so far. The phone is excellent condition. Works great and was super easy to set up. Package was delivered promptly and came within the time frame I was given. Currently writing this review on the purchased device. If necessary I would definitely purchase again!! Thanks Amazon!!,18,5
Apple,Came earlier than I thought! In perfect condition and was also unlocked ! Will buy again if I needed to,10,5
Apple,I have reveived a box with a charger and cable and NOT the actual iphone. this is a scam . It doesnt even look like a true Iphone box. I am sending this back to get my refund !,87,1
Apple,I paid $ 799 got a phone is a real doll This is very Masef,65,1
Apple,"The phone was never paid off by the previous owner. When I tried to switch it over to my account , it suspended my whole Verizon account causing me to lose my number. It's just real frustrating that I spent all that money on a phone that could never be mind. I feel foolish for buying it and I just want my refund for the phone and the one day shipping cost!",10,1
Apple,"IT IS NOT UNLOCKED !!!!I CANT USE IT....WHY DO YOU WRITE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT IS AN UNLOCKED PHONE.IT SAYS WHEN OPENED "" SIM NOT SUPPORTED""I CANT ACTIVATE THE PHONE.....",10,1
Apple,"The fist week when we received this iphone, we found there was a big problem when we play the vedio after recording the piano performace. The sound was with regular volume for 3-4 seconds and then became no sound. We retried many times to record different activities, playing flute, reading, but got the same result. The sound is not stable. We made sure we didn't touch any keys when recording. We are very frustrated to have this defected one and hope to return it and get refund ASAP.",33,1
Apple,"I bought my iphone 64gb but received the 16 gb, I feel scammed",11,1
Apple,Phone was not new as listed on Amazon. Phone was blacklisted so it couldn't be used. I was very disappointed with this purchase.,31,1

Apple,"Paid $800 only to get a fake iPhone!First of all, the charging animation is not Apple's at all. Second, the silence button is crooked. Third, the phone was used from when I opened the box, even forgetting the fact this is not an iPhone. You can obviously tell as well this iPhone is fake: I mean, look at the grammar. Apple or any company wouldn't do anything like this, and this doesn't look like stock iOS.",12,1
Apple,Terrible seller and to much problems,17,1
Apple,Was a failty peice- rather a demo peice. Volume button was broken.,14,1
Apple,"Do NOT purchase this phone from Amazon because it's from Japan, and it's impossible to turn off the shutter sound for ALL PICTURES AND SCREENSHOTS! There is NOOO way to turn this off. This is NOT disclosed in the description.",17,1

Apple,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsungƒ??s part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but itƒ??s great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nougetƒ??s vulkan api. They still donƒ??t look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10,5
Apple,"The phone is normally brand new, nothing special. But I have required for orginal receipt twice, and seller can't even provide any proof of the purchase of this iPhone.",13,1
Apple,I was a bit scepticle about the phone being unlocked but I must say it is 400% unlocked. I don't live in an area with at&t n those kind of big time companies I live in the Caribbean with local phone companies and it works perfectly . I'm very very very happy with my purchase.

Apple,"Be careful, I ordered this phone and it wasn't an unlocked phone. It is setup on the US Reseller Flex Policy. It looked like it was purchased at Best Buy, ""sim free"". I could not activate it with an international SIM Card. Luckily I found someone with a US Verizon SIM card to install durning the activation process. Once it was activated with the Verizon card I was able to install my international Sim Card and everything worked.If you are looking to purchase one of these phones internationally make sure you have a US sim card to go through the activation process, or research the US Reseller Flex Policy.",127,5
Apple,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",75,5
Apple,Thanks. As expected the phone is very good. The only limitation is that it is not possible charging and listening to music at the same time.,10,5
Apple,"Love the design and a great phone but sometimes the home, power and volume buttons become unresponsive and other times the camera is just completely blank or blurred and I'm unable to take pictures. Also lags here or there. Don't really recommend.",15,1
Apple,"The charger doesn't charge as fast as an ""actual"" iPhone charger and the phone did NOT come with headphones.",16,3
Apple,Awful reception no matter where I go. Only time I get something resembling reception is near a cellular antenna. Phone is clearly defective. Now I need to tolerate this as I can't go without a phone. No service to 1 bar everywhere I go.,10,1
Apple,"It's fake iPhoneDo not buy from this market, anything has given me a Chinese phone",51,1
Apple,"This is an Apple iPhone but 100% Chinese version that ha language, browser, apps and store settings in chinese language almost impossible to change. Also, the earphone jack is too small so I can't fit the original iPhone earphones or any other earphones in the audio jack",12,1
Apple,Bogus phone. Not unlocked. Is a locked trac phone.,22,1
Apple,"it is not ""unlocked"", a waste of time & money.",13,1
Apple,"Biggest mistake I ever made. I was sent the wrong phone, the charger was European and it was set up before with someone's iCloud info on it. I paid for overnight on 4/20 and finally got it 5/4. I took it to the Apple Store and it would not ever work here or on AT&T.",13,1
Apple,"I gave 1 star only for the iphone 5se because when i receive the phone, i found out that the pin key to open the sim card slot was missing and when i opened the sim card slot there was a verizon sim. I think that the phone was not brand new.",14,1
Apple,"This iPhone gives me nostalgia, but not because of it's ""retro"" design remembering the 5s. It feels nostalgic because 10 years ago I used to carry similar sized digital cameras to capture my life in photos.When smartphones became more powerful with better cameras I still waited because they still lagged in a few things and getting a small point and shoot was still a much better value for money.The SE makes the iPhone devices 'more affordable' and it is the smartphone that has finally convinced me to ""upgrade"" my portable photography philosophy to use it as my only camera for everything. The pictures are clear, beautiful, they are much better in low light than with point and shoot cameras, the camera app is super easy, and the shutter is fast fast fast. That was I was looking for.Speaking about software, wow what can I say that hasn't been told already? iOS is very fluid and minimalist, with no bloatware, something I appreciate A LOT. With Android, even with high end devices, you still feel some hicups and lag from time to time, but iOS is the king of ""smoothness"". I've even seen 5 years old iPhone devices working still like the first time.I don't care about the screen being smaller than other smartphones nowadays, because I don't watch much video on my phones, I'm minimalist so I just keep a few apps for messaging and photos and that's it.The battery life is great, but charging takes like 1.5 hours.Typing is something that will take me a few more days to get used to, coming from a 5 inches screen, but it is something I can live with.",14,5
Apple,Not an unlocked phone!,17,1
Apple,"Is locked with Verizon , not unlocked !!!!",16,1
Apple,Phone was network locked and did not meet my expectations at all..aweful service!!,16,1
Apple,"Nearly all the features of the iPhone 6S in a 5S-sized package. Fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate, camera is amazing, A9 chip is lightning fast. Oh, and it still has a headphone jack. Why buy a 6S when you can have this for $200+ cheaper?",24,5
Apple,"Since so far I am the only reviewer with an iPhone SE, I see it as my duty to present this iPhone to you. Yes, I do have this phone (sorry I have in Rose Gold, but workmanship is the same) and I am writing a real review (pictures provided!).Okay, there has been a hype for about a few months now, and the new 4"" iPhone is finally here. Some important points to take note of are that this phone has the exact same body as the iPhone 5 and 5s. Literally the exact same. Unlike the 6s that was slightly larger than the iPhone 6, this iPhone will fit each and every case and screen protector made for the iPhone 5 and 5s. Really the only difference is that this phone comes with matte edges instead of chrome, and the legal labels on the back are removed.The next point was that this phone is better than the iPhone 6 (and much cheaper). Don't let the 4"" screen fool you, this iPhone's stats are mostly on par or better than the iPhone 6 (and no, bigger screen is not better). Take the resolution. 326 ppi, same as iPhone 6. A9 chip, better and faster than the A8 in the iPhone 6. If pictures are your thing, there is a 12-megapixel iSight camera, better than the one in the iPhone 6. Don't forget Improved noise reduction, also better than the iPhone 6. Don't forget the panorama that features up to 63 megapixels, you guessed it, better than the iPhone 6's 43 megapixels. Oh, and I almost forgot (not really), 4K video is a blast. For selfies, the iPhone SE now features Retina flash, or flash from the screen. Battery life: the iPhone SE has the best battery life of all iPhone for sale today in terms of internet use time.So should you upgrade? I will start with those without a contract. If you hold any iPhone with a 4"" screen or smaller, and you are free from any contracts, then yes you should upgrade. This includes current users of iPhone 1/3G/3GS/4/4S/5/5c/5s. Here's why. If you are without a contract, you probably paid more for your current phone than you will for this one. Given that you were able to afford a full price iPhone, you can definitely enjoy the features of this phone. The way I see it, this phone is the perfect way to enjoy an iPhone 6s without the huge cost (and the 3D touch).iPhone 6 users, this one is a 50/50 call. You really should be happy with your phone, but, then again, I pretty much just trashed your phone in the specs throw down above. This one is a tough call, and one you and your wallet should decide.Those with a contract, if your contract is almost over, rejoice, you can get this phone for free. But, since you are shopping on Amazon for this phone, I assume you are not in a contract. However, if you are still in a contract for a while, it is up to you to decide if this phone is worth breaking your contract over.I hope you enjoyed reading this review more than I enjoyed writing it. If you have any questions, my email is on my profile page, and you should feel free to contact me. I, however, am not a representative from Apple, and you might just get better answers there. Who knows?",16,5
Apple,"I was very excite when this arrived due to all the great review. Right of the bat, the phone said I am on a lower IOS update so it won't be able to transfer my content from my old iPhone to this. But I ignored it. I had to individually redownload all my apps. Netflix won't work. It won't let me update my iOS. Has Chinese lettering in the back, like wtf. So many problems with this. I wish I could return this or get a replacement because this is bull-crap",12,1
Apple,Awful they only sent me 1/2 a watch band with no watch....,81,1
Apple,"Super pissed, screen came scratched. I peeled of the protective film and the face of the watch has two small scratches on it",39,1
Apple,"I just ordered this yesterday, I ordered one for me and one for my husband. His watch came, mine didn't. Just the box, and half a band. I'm going to give it another shot. But was very disappointed when I opened my box.",28,1
Apple,"I was excited to finally be able to get this watch. BUT when I tried to connect the watch I got an error message 'unable to pair with this Apple ID. ' so I called Apple. The lady told me I needed to contact seller. AND now I'm waiting on a response. Looks like I've been 'duked', I want my money back and I'll order from Apple.",26,1
Apple,"The watch is great, the seller not so much. The watch, which was refurbished, quit working after a week. Seller made me pay to ship it back and though it's been a month, STILL waiting for a refund. Bought a brand new, not refurbished watch. Very happy.",25,5
Apple,"I have ordered this product twice and have given two separate watches to people as gifts. I am pleased with the actual watch... it works great. However, I am so disappointed in the packaging of the watch. I would NOT recommend buying this refurbished through here. In the first watch I ordered there was not a charging cube to plug into the wall included, but there were two band straps in the package. The second time I ordered the watch the charging cube was included and the strap was not. Also, the backing varies... such as the second watch I ordered came in an official apple watch package. The first watch I ordered came in just a white box with no apple watch case to hold the watch inside the box. If you want reliable packaging and to make sure you get everything your supposed to be getting I DO NOT recommend buying this...I would recommend going and spending your money else where. Especially for such an expensive product, I would not again buy this product here because of the unreliability and the feeling that you might not be getting all that you are paying for.",16,2
Apple,the box is empty,15,1
Apple,"One review said it was locked out of the iCloud which made me a bit nervous, but I have had no trouble connecting to all of my devices! The product came in near new condition (if I hadn't know it was refurbished, I wouldn't know the difference) and it has been working great! I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend this option to anyone who wants an Apple Watch on a tight budget!",13,5
Apple,"Just got mine today. Seems to be working fine, a good way to save some money. You can tell it was referbished though, the plastic protecting the screen when I first opened the case was scratched (no damage to the screen though) and there are finger prints at the end of the watch where you adjust the size you prefer (at least on mine). Pairing my watch and syncing my apps worked perfectly fine. Nonetheless, I'm satisfied so far, now it's just time to test the battery life.",15,4
Apple,Bought for Grandaughter. It is working very good for her and so far she has been able to protect it with other items bought.,12,5
Apple,"Item description a flat out lie, ""Brand new Factory Sealed"" not sealed, not brand new... I will add pictures if I need to. Disappointed, any reply from Amazon that goes past a ""we're sorry and we don't lie to the customer again."" will just highlight the shady practice. Not nice.Taking a look at orders for new factory sealed iphone 4 8gb that were filled by Amazon I notice that this isn't an isolated incident. going back 6 months, this happened to 5 different customers including myself. Terrible business practice. I do not fault Planet Mobile since Amazon is clearly knowingly filling this new factory dealed description with a used, scratched opened box iphone.",28,1
Apple,"For Christmas I bought my son a ""refurbished"" iPhone from another seller. It arrived in plenty of time for the big day and looked great. Unfortunately when we attempted to activate that phone the carrier said it showed as stolen. Of course we were all a little heartbroken.I immediately contacted Amazon about the issue. Within 3 days I had my refund and another iPhone. The new phone looks new and works like a dream. Thank you Amazon for the fast refund so we could repurchase the gift.",24,5
Apple,This is my first iPhone and I love it. I've always been droid or blackberry fan but I can honestly say the iPhone has won me over.,22,5
Apple,"I know everyone says that if they have an iphone but it's true. It's a great phone. I have my music, texting, and apps all in one place and i love it. the only problem is it dies too much",13,5
BlackBerry,"Hello everyone, I've had this phone for the past 3 weeks and felt I was ready to write my own review for it.A bit of background on me so you know a little bit more of where i'm coming from.I'm 18 years of age so still rather young compared to most others, but I have quite an busy life which includes college, family, 2 jobs, and yes, bills. I am also rather tech savvy, at an intermediate/expert level.Blackberry Storm 9350!I'll give you a bottom line right off the bat for this product:If you want a phone for it's entertainment and good - not the best - business applications I would go with the storm.If you want a hardcore business phone go with the Curve or Bold as it's more suitable for emails and is much faster to type with if your on the go.The reason why I say this is because this is the first Blackberry with so many entertainment features like free news sent right to you phone you just click on to read, your own customizable ring tones, an amazing screen for ultimate video, a great camera (takes some time to actually take the picture but it's the same with other quality cell phone camera's), great email abilities, coming out with good applications making it a formidable foe to the iphone once again, free google maps and other browsers for your various needs, including the firefox alpha and opera mini!The only cons that I have found with this phone have been the fact that not as many applications that i'd like to get have been released, but that is not the phone's problem since it hasn't been out very long. Also the fact that if you purchased music from Itunes you have to tamper with it to transfer that music to your phone, I don't buy music from Itunes but I still don't like to be limited in that sense. The last con I have for this phone would be that when I go to actually answer the phone it has a bit of a lag, a time difference when i switch the phone from landscape to portrait or vice versa, and that makes it difficult if you want to ignore the phone call, as you can answer it using the actual answe button an the bottom of the phone without a problem.In the end yes this phone is a multimedia tool with the blackberry backbone for some good business tools, and as of yet I cannot find a valid reason to give it any less than a 5 star review as I believe for the price of $150 and verizon's coverage you can't go wrong with this smartphone.",16,5
BlackBerry,"nice color, it was little hard to get use to it, but 24 hours later i was able to do everything in it... loving the idea that is unlock which works with different providers ( in my case phone is att and my provider is t-mobile)... and doesnt come with any 2 year agreement...",15,5
BlackBerry,"Very nice phone: unlocked, delivery shipping OK, new box, the only bad thing is that this model doesn't iclude any leather case neither the memory card. The phone works correctly! battery, software already updated, everything...even when is used in different country: It's working perfectly with Movistar line, Venezuela.",73,5
BlackBerry,"This phone seems to be a ""Lite"" version of a BlackBerry, if you can call it that. It lacks some of the power that other BlackBerries have - namely, it couldn't work with my job's BES server. Which is not good. But in terms of being able to surf the web, and text, and all that good stuff - it's a pretty good phone.This happens to be the first BlackBerry to get the new trackpad, which, I must say, is an excellent replacement for the trackball. I like its sensitivity - if you don't, you can change it in the General Settings of the phone.I would probably recommend this phone for people who are new to the BlackBerry world - it's a good way to get used to the BlackBerry interface, and develop skills on the platform before getting to the A++ BlackBerry phones (read: Bold and Bold 2, as well as the Storm 2).",10,4
BlackBerry,"I purchased 2 phones which supposed to be new. One of them worked fine, the second one was not new. It was damaged. The SIM Card holder was missing a contact. The phone was not unlocked. I contacted the vendor's direct phone line and they never got back with me. I already spent $75.00 in getting it to work. I am currently in the Dominican Republic where I brought both phones as a gift to relatives. I will be back in the US this Saturday and will write a detail review. Again this was the worst online purchase I ever made.",10,1
BlackBerry,"I've bought this item and I received it in this conditions: the phone has the AT&T logo, the box isn't a genuine BlackBerry box (just oem), and the wall charger is not for my phone!! Could you believe that? You buy some phone and the charger doesn't work with it!! I am worried about this situation and I won't buy any other BlackBerry through Amazon.com. They do need to review their MarketPlace BlackBerry sellers.",35,2
BlackBerry,"Very good cell phone. It is a real Unlocked International Version, I recommend it. It should be a way to have a warranty or may be we cuold have a certification that this product have been tested and it works OK. The resolution of the screen is excelent.It is not too expensive and is easy to handle.",33,4
BlackBerry,"this phone is refurbished and badly damaged, never buy from (Wireovia) only work a week and when the technician opened the phone it was a disaster",11,1
BlackBerry,"Great Buy! all expected was sucessful, delivery shipping, customer service quality, new box, all accesories. The phone works Excelent! battery, software, everything...even when is used in other country (Venezuela), remember is UNLOCKED! Go ahead and enjoy your experience in new generation Blackberry trakpad and OS UPDATED!",24,5
BlackBerry,"Excelente Producto, tiene todo lo que necesitas, es muy completo. Solo falta el flash en su camara, pero todo lo demas, excelente! desde Venezuela Saludos",12,5
BlackBerry,"I bought this phone for my mother and girlfriend and i can say for sure that is a great device, easy to use, great display, great keyboard and the track pad what can i say, just smooth, i don't know about the durability of the track pad but it seems that is going to last longer that the track ball. i would recommend this phone for starters in this world of smart-phones, it very easy to use and to understand the phone.",13,5
BlackBerry,"I' m very upset, with this dealer that is why they say there is no warranty, the phone they sold me didn't work, and several stores had told me that there is a problem with the inner antenna, that can't be fixed and my problem is that I paid $200 for something that never worked, I don't know how others write good comments about this dealer, but I learn the lesson never buy something without warranty, no matter how good the price sounds, You will regret it later",14,1
BlackBerry,"its cheaper than the Javelin, and the camera is not great, but replacing the trackball with a mousepad was a terrific idea from the people of Blackberry, im sticking to this cell phone. In my last two BB i replaced the trackballs at least 6 times.............",16,5
BlackBerry,"I paid for a new itemI received an old one, very bad shapeSent this back, the seller paid for the return proccess.I received an used one again, but in a better shape.So I Keep itBUT I WILL BUY NO MORE AT AMAZON",15,1
BlackBerry,"the 8520 phone actually works well on at&t! no matter how much you learn the iphone keyboard, a blackberry full physical qwerty still wins, hands down. the spell checker and predictive type on bberry is better vs iphone and with the physical keyboard you misspell a lot less. since you can sync your itunes on here you only ""miss"" the iphone for its apps which really only work best on wifi. 8520 is lightweight, fairly thin, very light, has nicely spaced keys, and really cool media controls blended into the top of the device. nice use of rubber here on the device too lends some durability to glossy plastic finish. I jammed a 16G nand flash card into it too so i have music, movies etc with me. I bought the unlocked version since i use the 8520 when traveling to US from abroad .... without a full blackberry data package you lose out on things like email and blackberry messenger - but this is my 2nd/travel phone so i dont care too much - I use it when in the US with pay as you go on at&t - i get what i want a phone that works, easy texting, wifi browsing and music/video. iPhone is my main phone abroad but it wont stay that way once renewal time comes. I could easily see 8520 being my main phone but if you want the mobile internet experience (3G) and slightly cooler packaging then go for the 9700, but you pay for it - a lot more. given cost differential I would easily buy 8520 over 8900 ...8520 just feels a tad cooler too vs 8900 still too corporate. yet both are pretty similarly equipped. if you had full blackberry data package with this as your main phone u r probably happy person. i am more than happy with this as 2nd/travel phone. Cool thing about this unlocked version is i can buy pay as you go sim card, slip it in and work no matter where i am. in past my edge (non3G) blackberries actually run things like google apps and internet fairly well. i am sure 9700 with full 3G is better but necessary??",60,5
BlackBerry,"English:It's not new at all quite sure that the product is not new, the charger never served, as it is explained that a new charger does not work? the seller must test the product before selling it. the phone works fine with the operators of my country but again not new is remanufactured.Espa?ñol:No es nuevo, para nada muy seguro que el producto no es nuevo, el cargador no sirvio nunca, como se explica que un cargador nuevo no funciona? el vendedor debe probar el producto antes de venderlo. el telefono trabaja bien con las operadoras de mi pais Venezuela pero insisto no es nuevo es refabricado. sirve con movilnet.",11,1
BlackBerry,"It worked perfectly for a week. Then it started to freeze, and after two days it died completely. I tried everything but didn't work. In the process I lost all my contacts and valuable info. It seems this one was damaged or something, before I bought it it seems that all reviews were positive. So it might be only defective. In any case, I think I am switching to something different.",19,1
BlackBerry,"Well, what can I say...I purchased this ""new"" phone from Worldwide Distributors for my daughter's christmas present. I wasn't going to write this review until the phone started presenting some problems after 2 months of use. Some keys were not working, including the BB key, which gives you access to all he phone features. I had no other choice then take it to the local blackberry shop. For my surprise they told me that this was a used phone, that it had been repaired before and even had some kind of silicone internally from the last repair. Thank God they managed to repair the phone but the technician told me to use it very carefully as it can fail again anytime. I spent close to $100 for the repair.There is no way I can recommend to buy any item from this seller again. I've been thinking about sending a claim through the International Commerce Chamber for this situation. I live in Venezuela and I don't know if they will respond somehow for this deceit. Very sad situation....",17,1

BlackBerry,"I was searching for a phone of slightly better caliber after having two 8520's. I chose the 9320 as I am a believer in reading reviews and saw it had a good track record. I was not disappointed. It keeps me organized and everything comes straight to my phone which is very convenient (and a bit annoying). Takes really good quality pictures (thanks to the flash) and has a very user friendly layout. I am definitely going to have to source a case as it is quite light weight as compared to a 8520 and is more prone to accidents. I like the look and it really serves its purpose. Good buy. Comes with a 2GB memory card though so beware of that. the head phones have good sound and it comes with the USB/charger, installation CD and instructions.",18,5

BlackBerry,"I bought this Blackberry Storm few days back. This is the first time i though of going for a refurbished one. The looks are amazing. But to my surprize its touch screen was not working. And what can i do if a phone is operated only by touch screen and even that dosen't work. Then i figured it out that it required the side panels to be pressed hard and then the touch screen worked but even this was temporary, after some time it stopped again. I inserted my sim in it and tried to make a call out, call was going through but when calling it should displays the number to whom i am calling and my own number on it. But it does not display My number on it. It displays as 000-000-0000.Finally i had to return it back.

I told these people i wanted my money back they still ship the phone the, they recalled the phone in mid transit an sent me an email, mind you with such a matter i believe phone calls would be best but that's just my opinion,telling me that they will refund my money within 48hours to my knowledge 48 means within two days i received this email on the 7th of march 2011 it is now the 10th of march 2011 and up to now no one has contact me as to where my money is and when i will be getting it back this is my first time having dealings with this company (the OEM shop) and it has been the worst experienced yet i have googled trying to find other ways in terms of a phone number to contact this business to speak to a manager or someone in charge to no avail but what did come up on my Google search is posts and reviews of people who this company (the OEM shop) has done something similar to.To end off i would have to say people amazon is great because i have ordered stuff on the same day i ordered from the OEM shop and after and guess what i have already gotten my items but i have to say that the OEM shop will not be getting any more business from me other customers be aware you don't want to end up with the same problem i had.With that said i think amazon should have as a policy that persons or business who sell on Amazon need to put up more than an email address as contact info for those of us that end up having disputes like this because if you don't call (which you cant because there is no number) or email the OEM shop they wont contact you and tell you what is happen they need to realize people have to work hard for their money and don't wish to see it go down the drain for nothing again, Amazon is wonderful but the OEM shop needs to pull up their socks this is not a nice thing to be doing !!!!!!!!!",35,1
BlackBerry,"The most useless and worthless product I ever bought through amazon.I bought this for my friends in back in my home country and they were literally pissed off at me by unboxing the product.NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT.... Be patient to read this if you really want to buy this.The product arrived after 10 days of my expected delivery date. I used to email the seller everyday and the reply I get from them is ""Dear seller, Your package will be delivered in time"".The products I received were not new, they are not genuinely unlocked, the accessories you get are not original, head phones, phone pouch, boxing, nothing is original...one of the phone is broken too. I asked them for a replacement or return and they said I need to pay a 15% restocking fee and all shipping charges, which is obsoletely annoying.If anyone reading this doesn't believe me, please wait for my video review. I will post it in couple of weeks as I am out of country right now.I just wasted $380 in this useless product.",34,1
BlackBerry,"I purchased the Unlocked Storm because the description led me to believe that the phone would have full functionality on the all GSM networks. Unfortunately that was not accurate. OEM did contact me regarding some of the issues with the phone but they took two to three days to reply to my emails and would not call me to trouble shoot or fully resolve my issues. Because I was trying to get the phone to work following very cryptic emails from their technical person, I missed the 30-day window to return the product or a refund. The phone is still not working properly with our wireless carrier. I would not purchase this phone believing it will work with AT&T. I have always liked shopping on Amazon.com will continue to do so but I was disappointed with this vendor and the service I received.",32,1
BlackBerry,"First, it was asking for an activation code.It shows the veryson logo so it was supposed to be unlocked.I was trying to put it right and then puff!!, it was turned offforever and only shows a blinking red light.I take it to my carrier and they said nothing to do, it is broken.Now I have to send it back the seller and pay for it.A really bad deal to me.",27,1

BlackBerry,"Okay I spent my well-earned gift card my boss blessed me with on this phone...I am disappointed because I purchased this item and just received the blackberry. Apparently this blackberry was not the Blackberry I was expecting as I thought I purchased one with ""3MP Camera"" and...the one I got does NOT have a CAMERA! I am not a happy person right now,I email OEM shop hoping this was an error...I hope it is I will gladly return the phone back to their facility (standard shipping at that) in hopes they send me the correct phone with an ACTUAL 3MP CAMERA as advertised. If they feel they sent me the correct one well sadly I will need to tell them I want my refund and will take the appropriate protocol to return the item and get credited for this. I will keep you all informed on how OEM handles this.",77,2

BlackBerry,"I write because I made a purchase of a mobile phone blackberry 9650 on January 19, 2012 reaching east to Venezuela in March, I have with the cell just three months and already it does not work! I sent an email to the seller ROSS CELLULAR and they told me that only receive returns up to 18 days after the sale and came after me 2 MONTHS!, I find it irresponsible of the seller and AMAZON for selling a product that does not work, I make my investment, I waited patiently for 2 months now the phone does not work, I would be grateful to meet my claim promptly and failing my money back or replace me by a new cell phone.Blackberry 9650 Bold Unlocked GSM Smartphone with 3 MP Camera, Bluetooth, 3G, Wi-Fi, and MicroSd Slot (charcoal)",21,1
BlackBerry,I purchase this item to sent to jamaica and phone was not unlock properly.Have to pay $4500 ja dollar to unlock phone properly.,20,1
BlackBerry,"After I bought this product, I was not able to use internet or blackberry messenger with my local service provider CLARO in Guayaquil, Ecuador, Southamerica. Then I learned that not all blackberry phones, although being unlocked, work with all providers. In my country , CLARO (the company who provides service to the mayority) does not work with smartphones made for Verizon or Sprint. You should buy one made for AT&T. It is a problem of compatibility, you will be able to make and receive calls, but no internet or bb messenger. Happily I bought my cell from a serious company (Orderdirect), and right now they have exchanged my phone with one I can use. Hope to receive the new one in a few days.",13,3
BlackBerry,"WASTE OF MONEY, DONT BUY IT!Before i bought it i did an intensive research about what was the best blackberry for me at the best price.When i saw this particular phone from this seller i didnt think the price was the right, and still dont.When the phone arrived , hanging loose in the box with the charger in the middle, i immediately noticed something wasnt right. i turned it on and the battery went for only a few minutes. I charged a complain and after some days the seller answered. Took me a week to solve the problem. two batterys where sent to me ( after one more week of waiting). When i was actually able to use the phone i noticed I wasnt able to connect neither to wifi or 3G (wich are very important for a blackberry). I talked to the seller again and he wasnt able to solve it, or give my money back. i tried to solve the problem by myself in mobike stores but they all said it was a problem from the phone.I wasted tons of money on this phone, cant ise it properly and the seller didnt even try to solve it.THIS WAS A MASSIVE WASTE OF MONEY. BAD PHONE AND BAD SELLER.MY ADVICE: dont buy it.Thanks for reading",16,1

BlackBerry,"I wish I would have read the BlackBerry blogs before purchasing this phone. It was fine when I first bought it, but since software upgrades, the phone has deteriorated to the point that I am replacing it. The space bar places periods whenever and wherever and key touches duplicate and triplicate entries when texting and emailing. I restored the phone to factory settings and changed the input settings - nothing helped.I contacted RIM and they aren't interested in helping; needless to say, my replacement won't be a BlackBerry - now or ever. For over $400 you'd think RIM would care. Plus, the phone was sold without a warranty. All around it was a terrible purchase. Read the blogs before you buy this phone - actually any phone. This problem is the norm for this phone and it's quite disappointing that RIM hasn't found a solution.",13,1
BlackBerry,The product I received was as good as advertised. It works properly and I have no problem with it. great purchase,11,5
BlackBerry,"Only 2 months of use and the screen started to give trouble flickering and the display showing distorted.I immediately contacted the seller, who indicated they would change it for me, no problem as i thought i just got a defective phone.The replacement went fine although i did not get reimbursed for the shipping even after i was told that i would have been, i was just happy to have the phone replaced, so that didn't even bother me that much.A further 4 months later the replacement decides not the power on one day and a battery icon with a red X was displayed, after some research i was able to reload the OS and it worked.1 month after, same problem with the red X, only this time i cannot reload the OS.After some more research and closer attention to the phone i discovered that the phone has:1. FAKE BATTERY2. WATER DAMAGE - the water damage indicator on the phone is red, which means it had gotten wet. (I didn't even know these phones had that indicator, until today)3. LCD SCREEN REPLACED4. RUST in the phoneI was very disgusted to make those discoveries as i had specifically ask if this replacement was a new phone and their response was ""yes. we only deal in new items"".This leads me to believe that the original phone i got was not at all new although the box had the seal on it.This has been my worst experience on Amazon ever.Wireovia should be banned from selling on Amazon.DO NOT purchase from the seller WIREOVIA they are deceitful.",14,1
BlackBerry,"I always wanted to buy a Blackberry phone, however what I received from Amazon was a refurbished phone.

BlackBerry,"I recently bought this phone from Worldwide Distributors. In the Technical details of the product it clearly states ""Quad-band GSM cell phone compatible with 850/900/1800/1900 frequencies and US/International 3G compatibility via 800/850/1900/2100/ 1700/2100 MHz, UMTS/HSDPA plus GPRS/EDGE capabilities"" The phone I received is not compatible with all 3G bands as stated. I got a T-Mobile phone which works with 3G bands 1, 4, 8; that is equal to 2100, 1700, and 900 and does not work with 1900 my operator 3G band, also does not work with 800 and 850 as stated in the Tech details. So I bought a 3G phone that does not work in 3G which is equal to a 450USD paper weight. Needless to say I am surprised that Amazon been a company of such high reputation allows sellers to publish such false and misleading advertisement. If that wasn't enough Worldwide Distributors return policy clearly states ""Cell phones may only be returned for refund within 3 days if they have been unopened and all original seals are intact."" You will need to open the box and turn the phone on in order to see frequency with which it works, so this means, screw you, we will not accept the return of the phone. Last but not least, should you happen to know which operator works with which frequency, they have this little pearl in the return policy ""Buyers are responsible for network, GSM band, and Carrier compatibility, including internet browsing, picture and text messaging functionality which are not guaranteed."" Double screw you, you just paid 450USD for a paper weight and you are stuck with it. Worldwide Distributors you SUCK and I will make sure that everyone I know knows about this, and AMAZON ignorance is not an excuse.....",78,1
BlackBerry,"The phone was advertised as brand new when i bought it in early January 2011. To my surprise, I switched it on to find a thread of love text messages from some guy back in Oct 2010 which obviously means it had been used. The phone does look brand new and currently works without any problems. It better stay that way considering how much $$$$ is splashed out for the device!!!!So after about one month, the key pad especially the BB button started malfunctioning. I tried to return the phone unfortunately, becos i moved to Africa shortly after the purchase, US customs made it difficult to return to seller. So i decided to cut my losses and buy a new key pad which i did. It worked better although for the BB button, it was still faulty. I then realized it was a problem not of the key pad, but in the underlying board.So i've had to live and struggle with the phone until yesterday when the screen went crazy. Now i cant see anything on the screen. I'm going to have to buy a new one.......Lesson learned. This time, i'll buy directly from Blackberry or a national carrier",71,1
BlackBerry,"I live in the Caribbean, so I bought this phone and had it shipped to my Mom in the US .

I thought I was being paranoid so had some friends to listen as well and they all agreed. I am in tears, and have to look for someone now to fix it after spending all that money, my heart is hurting. I also found music on the phone as well which means that it is not new as you said. You people are very wicked, selling faulty devices, will never order from you again and I make sure that I tell my family, friends facebook, twitter, users etc not to also. You guys are EVIL",38,1

BlackBerry,"Bold? Not really. But the best Blackberry you can buy today? Yes.I'm an Iphone user and Android user mostly, but if you have to have a Blackberry, this is a very nice device. It does do 3G on AT&T, it is snappy, the hardware feels very solid and quality-constructed. The screen is very high quality and the touch functionality works nicely.To me, the differentiating factor of a Blackberry (at least with their current OS) is that it has a full keyboard. If you are an email maven and don't spend much time on the internet, this is a quality device for that. On the contrary, this device does a very good job of integrating Twitter and Facebook into the factory-ready experience. A little 'net, and a lot of email productivity.Yes, iPhone and Android have more apps. If you need a full spectrum experience, you've probably already considered iPhone or an Android. That being said, if you strongly prefer a full keyboard or must use Blackberry, this is a very nice device.The battery life is great, too!",14,5
BlackBerry,DONOT BUY it from this seller. I bought the blackberry 9900 and gave as a present in one month. The keyboard was not working.

BlackBerry,"I owned a Q10 for about a year and although I liked it I wasn't completely satisfied with it. I recently upgraded to the Passport on the Black Friday sale and I really love it but I still missed the keyboard and form factor of the Q10. So I decided to order the Classic to check it out. This phone is the best of both worlds! Slightly bigger screen than the Q10 but still has that awesome keyboard and don't even get me started on the amazing trackpad and toolbelt. Moving to OS10 i thought i would never see it again but here it is and i love it!I have been using this phone for about half a day and I didn't think I would say this but I think I will return the Passport in favor of this Classic. I still have to get used to incorporating the toolbelt and trackpad into this OS but I am slowly getting the hang of it. The more I use this phone the more natural it feels.Overall, great job Blackberry! 5 stars!Will update after i get some more use out of it.",221,5
BlackBerry,"I get it. Phones are a personal choice and there are tons to choose from. People are very passionate with their opinions about which OS is the best. I think each one has lots to like. Over the last month I have decided to get back into bed with BlackBerry. I was a die-hard fan up to the pearl and said I would never leave. Well I did and became an android fanatic big time. I owned them all starting with the Incredible, bionic, 3 Nexus, 2 Notes, Thunderbolt, and both Moto X devices. Switched one time to BlackBerry back in 2011 for 1 day and hated the phone as it was so slow. I was done forever! I had some free time and started reading about Blackberry again and decided to check out the Z30. For $225 I could not go wrong. I was super impressed. The horribly slow phone I was expecting was really good. I read about the lack of apps. Not true. Amazon App store was good but I wanted more so I found an app called SNAP and had access to all the apps I used which are mostly financial ones and Google music. Some apps that require play services were not 100% compatible but worked.I then bought the Passport and love it. Beast of a Machine!!! Cannot say enough great things about it.Today the classic arrived and yes it will remind you of the classic blackberries you loved but it is now caught up with the times. This phone has a premium feel to it and has some heft which only adds to the quality feel. I have also found with the new 10.3.1.1154 update that some android apps I often use like Netflix and HP Print All In One remote are now fully functional. Netflix will now cast to my Samsung smart tv's and hp remote now allows me to print to my wireless printer and utilizes the scan function. The scanning is key for my business as I can scan docs directly to my phone!!! Internet browsing is speedy. I have compared this side by side with my passport and my wife's iphone. Browsing with the Passport is a tad faster and is equal to the iphone as far as uploading websites. I also use Microsoft's wireless display adapter which works flawlessly with my Blackberry phones. No more hooking up cables to my TV or projector. I just cast my screen to them both and can watch/listen to whatever is on my phone Doing powerpoint presentations is a breeze with this function. Battery life is exceptional and will easily get you through 1 day!! The ability to set short cuts with the physical keys is simply awesome and something I did not realize I missed from the blackberries of old. This is a huge time saver for me as I do not to search for apps and settings on my phone. If you are someone who has several email accounts and are on LinkedIn and Facebook you are going to love the HUB. You can easily access all of your messages and notifications in one place and it also has your text messages. I love this feature as I do not need to log into those accounts or apps to view my messages and notifications. Blackberry Blend is another great feature. If you are working on your desktop or laptop you can access everything on your phone (file, emails, texts, etc) and reply from your computer. I also have Sonos speakers throughout my house and was concerned that I would not be able to use my Blackberry to control them. The Sonos App works flawlessly with the Classic. Having spent the better part of month with 3 different Blackberry phones I would recommend these phones to anyone. I still have my Moto X 2014 Pure Edition and have not picked it up in 3 weeks and will be selling it soon as there is nothing I am missing since the switch to Blackberry. In fact I am able to even more with my new phones. One last thing of note I am on ATT and get LTE and the signal strength is the best of all my phones. If you are unsure about BlackBerry because you have read the negative reviews online or fear the company will cease to exist. I would say pick one up and try it and it may surprise you and be your next phone. Well done BlackBerry and thanks for listening to your customers and excited to see what you come up with next!!!",182,5
BlackBerry,"I am a BlackBerry loyalist coming from a Bold 9900 and now 4 months of use on a Passport. I also have a Samsung Note 3, as a toy, but Blackberry has always been my preferred system for the way it files messages into one of my hundreds of exchange folders without a lot of scrolling; plus I trust it, so I'm not going anywhere.A 4 month stint with the Passport reminded me of the value of one handed operation, and the importance of the toolbelt in making one handed operation efficient. It comes down to which is more important, reading or one handed operation, because you cannot have both. In the end, I have come to accept that a phone is first a phone, and one handed ergonomics matter most. For that, a smaller size with well-placed hard buttons is worth trading away non-essential functions that are better performed on a PC anyway. When it's time to end a call, the natural impulse is to press a hard END button that will always be in the same place, not to swipe around for the phone app to find the virtual button. For those of us who are always doing 2 things at once, it helps to have always-on hard buttons right where the thumb is comfortable. The Classic gets back to phone fundamentals, with an OS upgrade.Speed keys are improved. You can now speed message, not just speed dial. Just like speed dial, you can assign the key of your choice to text a specific person, or email a specific person, so that after you long press the designated key you can immediately begin typing the message. Can't do that on the 9900.The Classic is pokey. With greater familiarity the lag has become irritating, especially in the calendar app and when filing and deleting messages. On a few occasions I have accidentally misfiled and deleted messages as the system caught up. The pokiness of the Classic is by far my biggest gripe. The Passport is snappy, so why isn't the Classic? Answer: the processor and RAM are mediocre.For hand comfort, the Classic could be better. It's bigger than the 9900, and the back texture feels like hard plastic with nothing special to help the grip. Ergonomically, nothing beats the 9900 with its smaller size and rubberized concave back where your fingers would cradle the phone. I can see the value in the phone's extra girth, but the back texture should have been kept the same as the 9900.Update: I got out the old 9900 after 9 months on the Classic and wow the 9900 feels incredible. Small, light, super comfortable. I hope when a Classic 2 comes out (if ever) that it will be the same form factor as the 9900 but with OS 10. No doubt about it, OS 10 is a major improvement but the Classic's ergonomics are comparatively lousy.About the calendar: One major improvement to the BlackBerry 10 calendar app, over OS 7, is the ability to view text details with WEEK at a glance. If you pinch out, the view will reset so you can view all hours from 9 to 5 and still be able to see who you're meeting with. The Passport also does week at a glance with details, with 3 more hours vertically and 3 more characters per column than the Classic. This was without question at the top of my wish list and very happy to see it in BB10. However, the calendar app has a few design flaws. One, it does not allow appointment creation or editing with a single click. Once you have clicked a time slot, you have to click into the menu structure even deeper still to edit the time, which is inefficient. Then, the time duration is set by a horizontal slider bar or a drop down box, neither of which is intuitive and you cannot see what else you're bumping up against. Second, when you receive a calendar invitation via email, there seems to be no calendar shortcut to check availability before accepting the invitation (OS 7 could do this), so instead you have to take the long way around and remember the proposed date and time as you search your calendar.Web browsing is very fast to load pages and I would say just as fast as Chrome. It runs scripts and remembers login credentials for the sites you allow which it will prompt for the first time you log in.Ideally the home screen showing active apps could be hidden. The open apps just gets in the way because the apps are not in the same location every time. I prefer to tap the icons which are in a static location. It would be fairly easy to hide the active apps home screen by user option.Bottom line, I like the Classic for software reasons, but I miss the 9900's superior responsiveness and ergonomics. Hope you hear me, Blackberry: RESPONSIVENESS AND ERGONOMICS!",114,3
BlackBerry,"Love this phone. The keyboard is amazing! It's perfect for business. I use my cell phone not as a multimedia toy but as a business tool: managing contacts, emails, messages, scheduling meetings, looking up online information, opening spreadsheets, it's all very straight-forward. I can't stress enough how convenient it is to have a physical keyboard and an optical track pad. The latter is great for selecting text (copy/paste without the heartburn), scrolling without having to put your fingers on the screen, and operating menus and pull-downs. I love the browser which is fast and easy to use with the keyboard. Pressing ""r"" put you into ""reader"" mode, ""u"" copies the URL, etc. There's keyboard short-cuts throughout the system, allowing you to delete emails by pressing backspace, pressing ""r"" to reply, ""L"" to pull up the calendar, and the short-cuts can be customized to do whatever you want. I have several keys associated with contacts that I call a lot. All I have to do is press that key and it will call that person. It sounds petty but I love having that functionality as well as physical buttons to start and hang-up a call. There's many more great things to be said about this phone. The Hub is great and ever-present. With a single swipe you can see all of your emails, messages, and notifications in one spot, and return back to what you were doing without interruption. I should mention Blackberry Blend as well. It's an application that essentially ""mounts"" your phone on any computer that it has been paired with, via USB, Wifi, or even the cellular network. From that point on, you can email, message, set calendar events on your phone, from your desktop, but no information is copied between the phone and your desktop. You are ""remote"" operating your phone from the Blend software. Very convenient (and secure if you are managing many different work/personal accounts). I use it all the time because I can continue to work on my desktop, without having to fetch the phone out of my pocket. The camera is quite good, and I don't have to put up with the iOwnYourDataSync nonsense. There's even cool features like being able to ""dial back"" faces on group photos to find the best expression for everyone individually. Many reviewers seems to focus on ""app"" availability, and obviously it's not as good for this platform as it is for the iPhone and others, but to be fair, I just don't use my phone that way and it does have very good FB, Twitter, LinkedIN, etc apps. One last thing: this phone has *amazing* battery life! I easily get through 2 full days without having to charge. I will say that I think Blackberry could have made the specs a little more competitive for the price, but a more powerful processor etc could have adversely affected battery life, so it may have been a trade off.To summarize, great phone, great hardware, great tools, love the keyboard: 5 stars.",10,5
BlackBerry,"Wonderful phone!! Track pad!! Keyboard!! Super fast, very configurable, apps downloaded from Amazon (Waze among them) all work fine, contacts super simple to transfer from pc via bluetooth, hub very practical, screen crystal clear and easy to read, customizable ringtones, whatsapp works perfectly...in fact, everything works perfectly. Have encountered no problems whatsoever. Just a great device in every way.",10,5
BlackBerry,"UPDATE (6/30/15) So I've had this phone for about 6 months now. This is STILL a beast of a phone and I still love it. I does nearly all of what I ask of it, and does it better than any other phone that I have had. The only things that don't work well are the games. Some that are built for Blackberry look and work wonderfully. Those from the Amazon App Store will be hit and miss. Waze, which I use every day, works beautifully, if a bit slowly, but the app is a battery HOG.. Even still, with that app run twice a day for up to an hour each use, and the normal texting, checking/sending email, listening to the built-in radio, phone calls, etc. I can still get through an entire day on a single charge. And to be honest, I don't miss the games residing on my phone and taking up space. This phone shines on what it is designed to do... make crystal clear phone calls and help to keep you organized. Oh, the Hub is AWESOME for keeping your messages in one place, too.I've had this phone for about a week now, and I continue to be impressed by it. I am by no means beholden to any particular phone OS. I've had them all in one form or another. I've had the G1, G2, Samsung, Nexus One and 5 androids, a Windows 7 and 10 phone, a couple of iOS devices, and the Blackberry 8100 and flip. Being new, the Classic beats out the older Blackberries without a doubt. It is, in my opinion, the best phone that I've had to date. But it is not for everyone.Apple devices are great for those who want something that is simple and generally works very well. There are plenty of apps in the store for entertainment and limited productivity, and to be honest the devices do work well. Androids are great little gaming machines that allow some more customization than iOS does, plus there are also tons of apps available through Google and Amazon. Plus there are android styles out there for just about anyone. Windows has come a long way from Windows Phone 7. The devices generally have better battery life than either Apple or Android, and the OS is very easy to use (especially if you have a PC). The Windows Store is coming along, but it has a way to go to come close to the others.All of these devices suffer from the same handicaps; battery life and true multi-tasking capability. Yes, you may have multiple apps open and running, but getting to them can become an acrobatic exercise of button holding and swiping, and you run the risk of accidentally closing something that you want open, like the telephone. Batteries on these devices frequently fall short of a full day or usable battery, even with moderate use.This is, like most previous reviewers have said, a productivity device. Phone conversations are simply crystal clear, and you have the ability to truly multi-task while on a call. Need to write down a confirmation number or address while you are on a call, not a problem. It can be done from the call screen. Typing is so much easier with a physical keyboard than on a virtual keyboard. It does take some getting used to, especially if you like to use the swipe functions, but typing is more accurate. And there is something satisfying about the little click of pressing a key... an actual click and not an app generated sound sample. I had forgotten how much I missed the physical keyboard.The screen is crisp and clear, and most web pages can be read without needing to zoom in or out too much. There is no rotation feature to the display, but it is a square screen and therefore not really needed. Some may think that it is too small, but with a virtual keyboard up, the actual screen space is comparable.The track pad is greatly improved over the old track ball, and can be used in conjunction with the touch screen. This makes placing the cursor easy and accurate if you need to correct spelling or to cut and paste. I can even log into my online classroom and do homework relatively comfortably... something I couldn't do on any other device, even a tablet.The battery life on this device is simply exceptional. I am an average user that usually makes a couple of phone calls a day, checks my email, reads news stories, texts, etc. The first couple of days of use, the phone would get down into the 10% range. I'll attribute this to playing around with the settings a lot to get things just right. After the first couple of days, on an average day, I am getting to the end of the day with better than 40% of battery left. Battery saving is not on and the screen is at moderate brightness, WiFi is constantly on but bluetooth and NFC is off as they aren't used. I couldn't get anywhere near this with the androids, and Windows would take me to about 10% by the end of the day.The cons for this phone are what have been previously stated. Blackberry World (their app store) is a little thin on apps, depending on your perspective and what you are looking for. The Amazon App Store is pre-installed, and what I have loaded works with a couple of exceptions. No, not all apps will work and will crash, but for the most part they work just fine for what I use. If I want to play a game from Google or Amazon, I'll just use my old phone or my tablet.In all, this is a great phone for me, and it is a comfortable size, not some monster like a Samsung or iPhone 6+. If you are an app collector or play games heavily on your phone, then this is not the phone for you. If you want a phone that can get through a day of use, have crystal clear phone calls, AND you can multi-task and type comfortably on, then give this one a look.",10,5
BlackBerry,Great up grade from the Bold 9900. Take a learning curve for BB10. Little top heavy for one hand typing.,10,4
BlackBerry,"I just got the phone (on Sunday via USPS no less), swapped my microSIM for a nanoSIM and have been using it for about 5 hours. Wow. All I can say is BB has come a long way since the last time I used one (about 6 years ago). Besides the obvious, a keyboard, it has everything I like about every phone I've used - in one place. The desktop integration (macbook pro) is amazing. I was typing txt's from Blackberry Blend (desktop app) on my macbook while talking on speakerphone. Notifications popped right up on the desktop while I was in the call. This is a phone that can get things done. Android apps I've tried so far run identically as they did on my Android. I can't speak toward battery-life yet, but so far, so good. The OS and associated desktop apps have a clean, modern design that adhere to today's UX/UI standards and practices. The only thing I was concerned about was the square screen but it is not an issue for me. There's plenty of real-estate even with a keyboard.I am a T-Mobile customer (they don't sell BB anymore). However, my visual voicemail works perfectly. I'm still trying to figure out if I can enable WiFi calling. I'll follow-up if/when I do.",43,5

Quality control does not seem to be so good as Apple products.6. Picture and video quality is average.7. Sharing more than a few seconds video by email is difficult.8. Wireless screen mirroring is not possible. It means that you have to purchase slim port separately and have it with you if you want to connect your phone to a video projector.9. GPS functions are very basic.",11,4
BlackBerry,"If you want to communicate efficiently, and get work done, this is the smartphone for you. The physical keyboard is probably the best one that BlackBerry has ever implemented since the keys are large and provide great tactile feedback. If you're worried about the lack of apps BlackBerry has, you can use the Amazon appstore and/or load Android apps to fill in the gaps.Though the display isn't as large as some of the 5.5"" phablets out there, it's still large and the 3.5"" display is bright enough to view outdoors. It's much less crammed than the Q10 was and fits more content.If you were the user that appreciated the Bold 9900/9930, this takes that formula and perfects it. Though the 9900 was a great phone, the battery was too small to make it through the day, the phone had to be rebooted after installing apps, and it would lock up (remember the black clock?) occasionally. This is no longer an issue with the robust BlackBerry 10 / QNX OS that the Classic runs on.The battery life is incredible and you can pound out emails and browse the web all day, and make it through the day easily.This is just the beginning, as there are more and more software updates coming to improve the BB10 experience even further.",11,5

BlackBerry,"This phone is simply awesome. I'm so glad I waited for this phone, though t mobile stopped carrying blackberry, I stayed faithful and did not switch to samsung or apple, used my bold 9900 till it broke, waiting for this phone. It's the sexiest looking phone on the market no doubt, with a solid build, it feels like your holding a work of art, the keyboard and trackball make it the easiest device to text and email with. My only concern was whether this screen was going to be big enough for me, especially when comparing to those gigantic screens that you see out there, and I am completely happy with it, it's perfect in size, easier to focus on then larger phones, and it has wonderful clarity. I definitely recommend you give this device a try you will be pleasantly surprised. Blackberry for life!!!",26,5
BlackBerry,"I've been a loyal Blackberry customer since 2003, first as a lawyer in a large law firm, and now as a lawyer in government. I've owned four different Blackberries before I bought the Classic.I have owned the Classic for a little over two months. For the first two months, it was great. I upgraded from a pretty old Bold, so the bigger scree, touchscreen and BB10 were all very welcome. It was also very fast, and a really nice device.About two months after I owned it, it starting getting streaks in the display. this is the first Blackberry I've every had a problem with. I called Blackberry. They are very nice, but rather than believe me that there was a hardware problem, I had to reload the software, send screenshots, etc. They tell me the RMA department has to help me. But apparently only three people work in that department, because they're never available. But after two days of run arounds, I finally talk to someone who agrees that they will send me a new one. They take my credit card number, which they will charge if I don't return the old one. OK, I understand.Then the fun begins. While I get an email with an RMA form, they never tell me the tracking number of the new device. They tell me on April 2 that it will ship in 3-5 business days. I call today (April 6) to get the status -- they don't know. They can tell me that it will ship by April 10, but have no further information. The phone is now useless, and I need it for work. And I have to wait 10 days?This is ridiculous. I could buy a new one on Amazon and have it tomorrow. How can it take 10 days to even ship the device? How can they not now the status when I call? The people I talk to are perfectly nice, but also perfectly useless. This is no way to run a business that is supposed to cater to business users.So I have two concerns - (1) quality-this is the first Blackberry of mine that's ever had a problem, and I've had four different ones over the last 12 years, and (2) customer service, which has so far been useless.",26,1
BlackBerry,"In a time where touchscreen phones dominate, BlackBerry is sticking to it's guns by introducing a phone which resembles the iconic Bold 9900. I skipped prior BB10 devices due to lack of a toolbelt, but luckily it is now present. What more can I say? I love this phone.It has everything you've come to expect from a BlackBerry, and in all aspects it certainly delivers. I am constantly reminded why they were once synonymous with the word ""smartphone"", and it's unique touchscreen-trackpad-keyboard combo allows for more efficiency and productivity than possible on an iPhone. Writing e-mails and texting is facilitated with a full QWERTY keyboard, so no more worrying about AutoCorrect mistakes. The Hub is also a clever concept, organizing everything into a single area. Swiping up to wake the screen is quite nice, and the phone itself feels well-built and experiences no device lagging (something many Android devices have).On the flip side, there are several tradeoffs you will need to consider. Most notably is the app selection: while including quite a few Android apps via Amazon AppStore, it does not match that of Google Play or Apple's App Store. For me this is not too much of a problem, but another key compromise is the screen size. Watching videos, they appear smaller than if viewed on a small (by today's standards) iPod touch 4G. There is no landscape mode due to it's square size. Finally, it's 8MP camera is by no means impressive, and lags behind many of it's competitors today. For a social and entertainment device, I advise you to reconsider before making a purchase.However, I gave this phone 5 stars because it satisfies my personal needs. As a soon-to-be college freshman, I believe this will be an indispensable tool for my education. In addition, I recommend this device for anyone who is aiming to be more productive, is yearning to have a keyboard, or is simply looking for a change from the usual. Personally, the aforementioned problems were not significant enough as to be insurmountable. Yes, apps are important, but I can access all the key apps I need from this device. If you've been waiting to buy the perfect BlackBerry, THIS is the one to get.Having this phone for a week has reminded me what I've been missing out of the past 4 years. While this phone won't restore BB's stronghold on the market, it is certainly a step in the right direction. Following the success of their Passport, they made a phone to show what they do best: create productivity machines for serious users. I think BlackBerry has a hit on their hands.",26,5
BlackBerry,"Have been wanting to jump back into a Blackberry after leaving for an Iphone a few years back.Considered the Passport, but the size was just a tad tolarge for me. However, the classic is just right in 99% of what I was wanting to get out of a Blackberry (OS is smooth, keyboard is PERFECT, screen is crisp and clear).The only reason I give the Classic a 4.5 and not a 5 is for the App defeciency although with Snap it can be resolved.Overall very pleased and highly reccomend to anyone wanting to jump back!",24,4
BlackBerry,"I am incredibly impressed with my new Blackberry Classic. Blackberry has improved this phone beyond my expectations. I love the hub, the calendar, e-mail and web browsing experience. I have all of the apps I need to manage my music, podcasts, BBM messages, and social media outlets. One app that stands out in helping me stay organized... Blackberry Travel... It is is amazing. Keep in mind, this phone will not give you the best gaming and social media experience. The social media and gaming apps are designed for basic usage, not power social media/gaming users. This phone is perfect for me, a professional that wants a phone to keep me organized and productive with the ability to run the ""fun"" apps as well.",24,5

I found this phone to fetch mails even in remote places where even 2G network is weak.* Excellent keyboardWorst part of this or any Blackberry phone is ""Very limited apps"".",24,4
BlackBerry,"Updated Review:Lowering my rating to 2 stars because I'm starting to hate this phone. This phone is becoming slower and slower. I even tried cleaning up old text messages but nothing helps. I have to wait like 5 seconds for it to find a contact and then it lags a couple more seconds before it starts dialing. Blackberry has stopped releasing patches which really sucks because one the last few patches released sometime in the beginning of 2016 really screwed something up with the Bluetooth pairing. Every time I start my car up I don't know what my phone is doing but you can't send text messages for like 20 minutes!!! If you go for a short drive to meet someone up your only option is to call them because it still doesn't work even after the Bluetooth is disconnected.Previous review:Finally they started listening to their customer's! Got rid of my iPhone 6 and couldn't be happier. I stopped calling, texting and emailing people because it was a major pain with that toy. This thing just works and is great for communicating with people. For those that like to game there is the Amazon App store. Gave it 4 stars because it's a pain to install google maps and what's up with the non-removable battery.",12,2
BlackBerry,"Having been a loyal Blackberry fan for over 10 years, I am sad to say I am not anymore. I purchased this in January 2015. The first one's keyboard back light didn't work upon arrival. Amazon replaced it. This 2nd one lasted until end of June 2015 when the camera stopped working and the keyboard keys started typing double at random. The 3rd one, sent by Blackberry warranty, lasted about 1 week when it had a complete failure and froze. I tried charging it, didn't work. I tried to reset it, wouldn't do anything. I asked Blackberry if they had any tricks for me to try, nada. I asked Blackberry for a refund as this product is clearly faulty on many levels - they only offered to send me yet another replacement. After 6 days, the phone decided it would unfreeze and be usable again. I use this phone to run a small business and cannot afford to have 6 days without a phone. I did not have a back up phone, nor was I at home when this happened, I was out of town for two and a half weeks, so this failure caused even more problems. The timing could not have been worse.I would give this phone no stars if I could. It's a shame because it is a decent phone, however after using an Iphone 5s for a week now, it's speed puts this BB Classic to shame. And, Iphone email is pushed immediately where this new classic lags like BB email never has before.Beware, this is not your old Blackberry... the Bold was the best phone ever, so sad mine wore out...",12,1

BlackBerry,Fantastic phone! I have wanted a keyboard for a long time and almost bought a Q10 but missed the trackpad then the Passport but didn't like the small keyboard and then I saw this was coming and I could hardly wait! ordered the day it came out and have been playing with it for hours now.pros:the phone is very fast and easy to type onthe screen is bright and big enough for mecall quality is greatfeels solid in the handcons:none that I can see yetIf I had to nit pick I would say needs a removable batteryUPDATE 3/14/15Had a charging issue and device would wake when plugged but would not charge. Amazon fixed issue and a new unit will be here soon.,22,5
BlackBerry,"After one year of using the iPhone 5s I've decided to upgrade to the Blackberry Classic. It's an upgrade because 90% of what I do is related to typing for business purposes and I'm just faster and more accurate with a physical keyboard than a touch interface. Business emails, salesforce.com CRM, calendar, IM, etc. I guess there's a reason my MacBook still has a physical keyboard. I'll keep my iPad for the 10% - games, social apps, etc. I'm on the road a lot and I need a productive phone with great business features, good speakerphone, battery life, and durability. The Blackberry Classic is currently the best phone in the market. If Blackberry continues to meet business needs with its upcoming iterations of this phone then I'll stick with the platform and not have to dabble again with touch interfaces or iPhone 7, 8, etc.",21,5
BlackBerry,"I've done so much research on this phone before buying it, and after using it for 4 months I am ready for an in-depth review based on real world experience.The Good:I enjoy the ability to hold and manipulate my device with one hand, the Blackberry Classic handles this aspect like no other phone I have used. Being very familiar with the Android OS and being a former BB user, I can honestly say that the Blackberry 10 OS is definitely highlighted on this device. The SWIPE controls are probably one of the most intuitive on the market. You can easily go from one application to the next with just a quick swipe. A lot of people have commented on the ease of the Blackberry HUB and if you are constantly getting emails, and FB updates, and text messages then you will appreciate this feature the most. The build of the Classic is very sturdy and the phone carries some serious weight compared to to other devices. (I personally like it because it makes me feel like I have a premium device in hand.)The Camera is honestly nothing to write home about, it is mediocre at best. The HDR is super slow processing the shot in my opinion compared to other devices like the Note 2 or newer devices, which is a let down since this one is newer by comparison. The Call Quality is GREAT! I love how sensitive the receiver is, it seems like no matter where I place the phone I am heard clearly. The speaker however I will address later.Battery life is....ehhhhh. If you are struggling to get or keep a signal or are texting like crazy then you will certainly notice the drain on your battery. The screen sensitivity is pretty responsive, however some of the lag might be attributed to the Apps...which I will discuss later as well. In the US the LTE on this phone is outstanding, and the OS makes downloads and uploads fast, really fast. T-Mobile's network is the one I have used and they have the feature of WiFi Calling that comes with an update, this feature is great if you're in an area where you don't have signal but have Wifi...but how often does that happen, right? Anyway the WiFi calling definitely takes away from the call quality so be mindful if you are using that feature, or really any WiFi calling app like WHATSAPP because the difference in call quality is apparent with this device.The keyboard! The keyboard! The keyboard!It is awesome! It takes some time to get used to it especially using a full touch screen for so long, but when you do your texting game will go from like 10 to 1,000! I have man sized hands (what does that mean right?) and at first I felt like the keys were way too small, but after a week or two of using it, I slowly forgot my initial complaint, and you will too I'm sure.The BadGuys you will not find the apps you are used to in the Apple Store or Play Store, you just won't. But you have the option of side loading an app called SNAP which will give you access to Google Play, sounds great right!? Well....not so fast. Although you certainly can find your favorite apps to a degree on either the Amazon, Blackberry, or Google Play stores, the quality of the apps WILL NOT BE THE SAME when crossing OS platforms! The apps made for Android devices are buggy and I mean really frustratingly buggy...it will make you want to scream. The number of native apps for Blackberry hasn't improved much over the years and hopefully with the PRIV now on the scene, perhaps Blackberry will integrate the best of BB10 with Android from now on, or better yet patch an update through that does it for all their BB10 devices! A guy can dream right?I also have to say that I am really upset that the phone has only one speaker! At the bottom of the device it appears that there are two pretty good sized speakers ready to go, but on further investigation and volume manipulation I am sad to say there is only one and its not the best. What's even worse is that I dropped my phone which is shielded in a case mind you, and I lost the use of that speaker on the first drop! No speaker phone, no ringing, no Youtube videos, nothing...How sad is that? Does that speak about the build quality of the phone, I think so, but I did drop it so I guess I can't pin all the blame on Blackberry... I guess.Long story short, it is a good phone, not a great one, but definitely better than the old BB Bold. If you are all about productivity and apps mean nothing to your life, then this is definitely your phone, Emails come quickly, your life is arranged in the HUB so well it hurts and the ability to type long emails is a huge life saver. But for the average person who wants to check your IG account, make your pictures prettier with filters, or play Subway Surfer as you wait in the doctor's office...I don't recommend it.The OS is a marked improvement from Blackberry's other OS but its not for everyone, the lack of apps, the glitchy behaviors you get when you side-load and speaker quality may irritate you enough to regret your buy, so before you buy please read this.Cheers, shoppers!*****UPDATE 1/2/2016******So this is an update on the Blackberry Classic, a phone that I had high hopes for but...that didn't hold up. The phone in spite of its Glitches and slower than normal response time, I still tried to love this phone, but the final straw...is when the speaker just quit on me!That't right...it quit! No rings for phone calls, no listening to videos, music, or even a caller on speaker phone...absolutely NO SOUND!!!!I've had the phone only 3 months and a few days and its value is completely shattered by this one aspect that highlights why all the other failing aspects were truly tell-tale signs. I am trying to contact AMAZON.COM LLC since the phone was sold by them, and apparently I can't return the DEFECTIVE DEVICE or get a refund...Really all I want is an exchange....even if it is a refurbished phone...Blackberry is even less help as they tell you to contact the seller to hash out your issues.*******************************************UPDATE 1/22/16**************************************************************Okay people I usually don't update an update, but as of about a week ago I was having issues with the speaker on my Classic. It has always been in a case and that's because we drop phones all the time, I mean really who has NEVER dropped their phone?Anyway after one drop from a fairly short distance I noticed that the speaker completely went out. I thought maybe it was the sound settings...ummm nope! Then I thought it was just a software glitch....ummm nope. The last conclusion was that the speaker sustained some damage and because of that the phone went silent. Now here is where it gets crazy.... A friend of mine says, ""hey why don't you just drop it again and maybe that will fix it?"" Now in my mind I am laughing, because what a stupid thing to say, right? And to tell you the truth I DID drop it again on purpose soon after, and nothing happened. However I took his advice a few days later by trying to show someone how you couldn't crack the screen on this phone, so I dropped it from a fairly high distance and .....viola! The speaker turned back on!!!!!! And now it works perfectly, I don't know what to say or think about this, but it definitely affected the rating I give the Classic, though not as high as it once was. It is a sturdy phone, and it has its faults to say the least but it has now become my backup and I'm comfortable with that.By the way, Blackberry offers NO support in the event your phone is damaged, you and the seller have to hash it out and if it's past the time period for returns, then its all on you. Keep that in mind.Cheers!",13,3
BlackBerry,Love this phone and I am putting the IPhone back on the shelf.,13,5
BlackBerry,"AWESOME! Flawless, sleek and very cool. I missed the track pad and full keyboard. Great phone!",13,5
BlackBerry,"Finally! Too bad it took so long, but for me, this is the perfect business tool. Much better than the Q 10 and although the specs aren't up to the Passport standards, for an everyday email and basic app phone the Classic is just terrific. Blackberry, Keep updating and tweaking the specs for a Classic 2 in 2015 and the core Blackberry fans, like me, will be very happy. I would pay a bit more for a faster processor, better camera, etc. But right now, I'm very happy with my Classic. Why am I so excited to have the Classic? I've been using it now for a week and I am back to virtually error free productive typing. I was OK with the Q 10 keyboard but with no tool belt my finger kept hitting the screen by accident. That caused errors and really slowed my typing. Now, with the tool belt, I am so much more productive. Next, the trackpad makes it so much easier for me to edit. I would get frustrated hitting the screen with my fingers and not landing where I needed to be. The track pad works perfectly, just like a mouse.Yes, I do have an iPhone 6 which is my fun phone for apps, pictures and some personal and short emails and texts. And I love that one too. Both are excellent phones, but for different applications. I would want to have both and wish Blackberry much success so we see more and better Classics and other devices in the future. Right now the Classic is my perfect traveling productivity tool!",19,5
BlackBerry,Longtime BB user. Coming from OS7 to 10 took a bit of getting used to. I never bought a 10 OS BB because they didn't feel like REAL blackberries. But now that I've customized everything including keyboard shortcuts this phone is great. Amazing keyboard... I really don't get why people love touchscreen so much. With the trackpad and keyboard you have very precise control and can type 30wpm on this thing! I will gladly trade an inch or two of screen space for a keyboard and trackpad.Blackberry Blend software is also great.It is a bit longer and heavier than I would like. It seems there is wasted space above the screen where the Blackberry logo is. Could they have shortened the phone and made it lighter? That would make this near perfect.,19,5
BlackBerry,"I still have my Note 4 all White I've had my Blackberry Classic for about 4 hours now, already I enjoy the keyboard over using touchscreen input! Absolutely the best feature of this style/type device. This is NOT a media consumption device though, Youtube looks dumb. LOL. So I won't be using this thing for media like I could my Note 4 or my Shield Tablet.I love the way it handles E-Mails, for instance my University uses outlook and I tried setting this up on my Note 4 and it wanted device administrator privileges and I am like N O !All I had to do on the Blackberry was type in my user name and password and wallah it worked perfectly very nice.I do feel more professional and just ""grown"" using this device though albeit I would enjoy greater internal specs just because it cost $449.99 ! I love BBM and the system so far works great, no camera lag like I saw in that one video and I have a lot of events.Speed isn't slow but it isn't ""fast"" but it feels amazing if that makes senseI was never into APPS and GAMES but I do use apps on my Note 4 like a personal finance manager, to do list, SMS back up restore, etc.. These apps I have used for YEARS. I really really REALLY love how EASY it is to go into individual app settings and manage app permissions !!!! OMG like YES..Android is got D__n intrusive ! Yes I am aware the government and the powers that be can access my devices GPS monitor my calls see my texts etc. ....DUH....BUT to at least have control over these apps is niceNow....I will do my due diligence to see if I can obtain similar apps to satisfy my daily driver needs. I bought a SIM adapter as I originally planned to keep both devices my Note 4 and this Classic. But really who wants to change devices everyday? It SOUNDS good and I LOVE my Note 4 just hate typing on the touchscreen !...but it sure is a BEAUTY inside and out.So.....idk honestly if I am going to keep the Blackberry Classic....the only apps I have are Facebook and Twitter and when I tell you there is only like 2-3 permissions total for each one I was amazed ! I love this. I won't be using the android thing only because to me I have a Blackberry device I need to use their APPS made for their system to achieve the BEST performance. SO time will tell but thus far a pretty decent device I love the professionalism and thought Blackberry puts into their devices and it very simplistic yet ""mature"" in a feel good way.Decisions I must make: Will I keep this device or am I currently experiencing nostalgia, will I use this and my Note 4 throughout the day via the SIM adapter tool, sell my Note 4 and use this solely as my primary device & use my Shield Tablet for my Android needs, return this and keep my Note 4, keep the Classic and have to sell it on Craigslist because my return time frame has exhausted LMAO.^_^ H E L P",19,4
BlackBerry,I am not a big review writer but this phone rocks. It feels as solid as anything I have ever used. The keyboard is the BEST BB keyboard ever. BB10 runs flawlessly. All I can say is that Blackberry simply got it right. Their marketing sucks because everyone who has touched this phone loves the interface. The ability to peek at your email is quite possibly the best feature of any phone anywhere. Is it my boss? No? Carry on then!!!!,18,5
BlackBerry,"I'm not going to leave a long review like so many other people have already. I have owned several Blackberry phones from the Curve>Tour>Torch>Bold 9900>Z10>Q10>Z30>Passport. All I can say is that I feel as if I have finally come home to where I am supposed to be. Or should I say to where Blackberry is supposed to be.I will not refer to the old Legacy devices except for the 9900 and Q10 for this review. In my opinion, the 9900 was the best Blackberry I have ever owned until it just got outdated and antiquated for today's usage. At least for me. When the Q10 came out, I immediately purchased it, and although I was familiar with Blackberry 10 from using my Z10, I found it a bit small and the keypad seemed a bit cramped. Still, I stuck it out. The Z30 was all touch and the Passport, way too large. Enter the Classic. Now let's get a few things straight. If you are planning to use this device to watch youtube or videos, it's probably not for you. If you are looking for apps and gaming, you can, but it's still probably not for you. This is more than just a business device. In fact I am tired of hearing this. From the moment I started typing on this amazing keyboard, to using my shortcuts, I just fell in love again. The display is larger and the phone just feels right. I keep hearing about how the processor is from 2011, but who cares? This device is built right. It does what it is supposed to do, and does it well. I personally no longer use the touchpad since I have been using gestures for a while, but you could if you want to. Every professional review speaks of the same garbage over and over again. Old style, outdated specs, lousy camera, blah blah blah... Forget them. I have pretty much owned them all and this phone just does it, and does it right. Nice job Blackberry!",18,5
BlackBerry,"Just got the Blackberry Classic in my mailbox today. I was extremely excited about this phone. I have always wanted a Blackberry QWERTY phone but I never actually got around to it. I enjoy my iPhone but I feel like its time for a change.My first impression was wow, this phone is pretty big compared to the iPhone I currently own. Second was the weight. Third was the sexy ""professional device"" look. But fourth and most importantly was the keyboard. Oh man the keyboard is sweet. I just click click click click away at it. Other hardware stuff I don't care that much for.I started to use the device, figiting around with it and I found some key differences that I guess a lot of people don't seem to mind or maybe these concerns may have been addressed. But first are the apps. I found that there's no seeking alpha app, I use that app daily if not hourly. And even if I somehow manage to get it I'm not sure if I can get the push notification on it that I love so much (I guess there are other similar apps out there like Bloomberg). There are also problems with loading images on the hub for my emails, I don't know how to fix stuff like that without my own digging etc.All in all being a first time Blackberry user, it requires a learning curve to use this device.Insanely sleek and a device worth showing off. I have seen people use shortcuts and other ways of productivity but I just have't been able to do it myself. I think it will take a week or so to get used to but I will probably love this phone 200% when that time comes rather than 150%. THANKS BlackBerry for the new year gift!",18,5
BlackBerry,"I am another user who does not fit any of the stereotypes or expectations for this phone. This is my first Blackberry phone, I'm not using it for business (I don't even work at a corporation), and it's my only phone. Why did I buy it? I consider touchscreens to be an interface downgrade. It's not a tradeoff I'm willing to make, because I only rarely use a cell phone for games or watching movies. This phone's interface, from the keyboard to the call/hangup keys, play/pause/skip/back keys (via the volume keys), etc. is truly excellent and the best interface in a phone I've ever had, both hardware and software. I am a heavy MP3 user and there are physical keys which support this even when the screen is locked, something I really appreciate. Interface is really important to me and is the main selling point of this phone in my opinion.Music playing aside, I only use phones when I need to do something - look something up on the Web, get directions with GPS, text somebody, call somebody, etc. The old stupid phone it replaced could do almost all of those things, but only poorly. So I bought something that makes all those things quick and painless. Videos don't fit so great on this screen (although the screen itself looks very nice), and I imagine some games won't work very well either. But if, like me, you use a phone as a tool and not a toy, this is probably the best one available.",14,5
BlackBerry,"Before switching to the iPhone, I was a big fan Blackberry. I had previously owned two different versions of the Bold and a Torch. But because I found the operating system that Blackberry used to be sluggish and unreliable, (needing several ""battery pulls"" a week) and due to the lack of apps, I switched to the iPhone for my last few phones.The phone that I replaced with the Blackberry Classic was the iPhone 5s. After opening the packaging, I used the tool included with the Blackberry to remove the nano sim card from my iPhone and place into the Classic. I booted up the Blackberry, and after a few minutes of setting up the date, time, email accounts, etc... I was up and running on AT&T's network.Blackberry's operating system has vastly improved since my last experience with it. After 5 days of heavy usage, I have had no need to reboot it or perform a ""hard reset."" It only took a few hours to become comfortable navigating the menus and setting up everything to how I wanted it. In fact, the Blackberry Classic allows greater customization than Apple would ever allow on their OS.As for the issue I previously had with the lack of apps that were offered on Blackberry's, it has been resolved with the inclusion of Android Apps in addition to Blackberry's proprietary apps.The hardware on the unit is top-notch with the focus being on the keyboard. The only thing negative I can say about the Classic is that it does not have a removable battery so after a year or two the unit will either have to be replaced, or sent out to have a new battery installed. Speaking of the battery, as a power-user I would have to charge my iPhone in the middle of the work day. With this Blackberry, I can get through the day and the evening with power to spare when I charge it for the night.The unit is slightly larger and heavier than the iPhone 5s, and to me that is a good thing. Holding it, you can tell that it is well made and built to last for years. I can say with certainty that the only thing more comfortable in my hands than the Blackberry Classic, are the breasts of a 19 year old coed.",14,5
BlackBerry,"I ordered this phone as soon as it was released on the 17 Dec. I have been a BB user for a long time and when I moved from BB Bold to the Q10, I was hoping to love the BB more. But the Q10 experience, which was on the whole good, lacked the features that I was still a BB user and not an iPhone or Android user. The Classic brings all the best of the old and the innovations of the new OS 10.The phone is so shiny, by that I mean, absolutely gorgeous, back to the best looks of the BB Bold. The SIM and the SD cards are now easier to install, since they are now on the outside; there is no need to break a fingernail trying to open the battery door, for there is none: the battery is fixed and not removable.The battery lasts for a long time between charges, at least 24 hours of constant usage. The call/voice quality is way better that the iPhone 6 (I own that one too, and I love everything else about the iPhone 6, expect the phone feature!--the calls are always dropping on the iPhone; no problems so far on the Classic).Since the classic now has Amazon app store, there is now more apps available. But be warned: not all apps there will run properly and those that do might take a lot more time to load and run.The BlackBerry Blend is absolutely wonderful: all messages (e-mail, text, etc.) now show up on your computer, and it is so much easier to reply a text or e-mail via the Blend without picking up the phone.If you are not too much into apps but care more about general productivity, this is the phone to have. It stands apart from all the rest, and it looks really posh in your hands.",14,5
BlackBerry,"Great BlackBerry device! I have nothing bad to say about the Classic. It has a solid, premium build, and just the right screen size. I highly recommend this phone for anyone looking for a great smart phone device that is great for productivity and play. This device does it all!",15,5
BlackBerry,"I have not used a Blackberry for 5+ years. I just received the classic.. and I think I like it.Here is why:Pro's- Ability to side load android apps. I currently have HipChat, Slack, Okta, Chrome, 1Password side loaded.- Touchscreen!- I can type a phone number or name and make a call within 5 seconds. Can't do that with Android / iPhone- Best Feature that everyone fails to mention.... THE MUTE BUTTTON !!!!!!!!! Android / iPhone needs one of these. I find my self scrambling to hit the unmute button on iPhone during conference calls.- Being able to read notifications easily on the lock screen- Loud speakerphone- Good battery life- Ability to configure notifications for each individual email account / messaging service.Con's- No touch unlock- No Apple Pay- Screen resolution not the best- Android apps sometimes don't work correctly",15,5
BlackBerry,"The speaker on my BlackBerry classic -- which I received new and unlocked from Amazon.com back in mid-January 2015 -- has ceased to work. The alarm makes no sound. The speaker makes no sound. I can't watch YouTube unless I do so via phone jack. And I've had it less than two months. I was an early adapter to BlackBerry, but, when the quality started to drop I went with several iterations of the iPhone. Because I prefer a physical keyboard I eventually tried the Q10 which was better than BlackBerry's previous efforts but not quite there. When the Classic came out, I paid full price for an unlocked version from Amazon.com. The first one I received had problems syncing calendar invitations from people with iPhones. Then a key fell off, and, because I'd had the device for less than a month, Amazon sent me a new one. Now the speakerphone has died on the replacement device. I work for a large law firm where nearly everyone has abandoned BlackBerry so I am exactly the type of person BlackBerry should want as a return customer. And yet, unlike with Apple, it is nearly impossible to get help or support from these people. It is as if they want to fail.",15,1
BlackBerry,"People can say what they want about this cell phone and the fact that it is a Blackberry. This is the best cell phone I have ever had, used or owned. I could write all day about how this phone has the best keyboard for typing and gets emails faster than anyone in my office and don't even get me started on the battery(2515mAh) almost one and a half times the size of an iPhone 6 battery. I love the track pad and nav keys, the screen is clear and protected with Gorilla Glass 3. It has some weight to it and feels like a premium device. I have to confess that I stepped away from this phone a few weeks ago and made the biggest mistake of my cell phone life. I traded it for a new Samsung Galaxy S6 Active and I did not have that phone more than a week before I returned it and bought another Blackberry Classic. This phone is top notch and I will never use anything else!",24,5
BlackBerry,"What a shame BB is discontinuing this model, because it's awesome. Handset is really well built and feels solid and high quality in the hand. Fusion between touch screen and track pad is pure awesome. Blackberry hub is the best and blows away other mobile email solutions. Blackberry blend allows me to fully synch with my Mac (unexpected win) including sending Text messages from the Mac. The ability to use Android apps puts it over the edge. If you primarily do Facebook and Instagram from your phone, this isn't for you. If you want the power to do full email and messaging including dealing with large attachments and editing long form text with the best mobile keyboard every offered, you are like me - and you will love this phone. Forget about the tech shaming you will face from kids, friends and colleagues. Do what feels right -- Blackberry Classic baby. My iPhone 6s has been in the drawer for two weeks, and I couldn't be happier with the decision.",12,5

BlackBerry,"Item ordered was well-packed and it arrived on time. I am very happy with my Blackberry Curve 9300. I love it. I did not encounter any problems whatsoever. Contacting the site (Worldwide Distributors) was fairly easy. I did not have to talk to a machine. I just wish all sites are just like Worldwide Distributors. I have started recommending it to my friends, especially those who are tied up with 2-year contracts with their service providers and find that those data plans are not exactly what they need.On a scale of 1-10, I will give Worldwide Distributors an easy 10!!!!",14,5
BlackBerry,"First and foremost, I don't think I've every left a bad review for anyone...and this isn't so much the company as it is the product and their lack of providing proper information. That being said - I was so excited to get my phone, but right away I had issues when I realized the instructions were wrong...the table of contents and pages didn't match or pages didn't even exist. I had trouble getting the phone to sync up and had to call my carrier to help. Once it did sync, the phone displayed over 50 old emails from an email account based in the UK (I'm in the US)...that is when it hit me that it wasn't NEW, but refurbished. And forget about contacts coming over easily...I was having to manually re-enter all of them! (I'm a self-published writer and I use my phone A LOT to help market and promote, that means a lot of contacts to transfer over!).I looked past that misinformation only to realize my mistake the following evening (barely 48 hours after I got the phone) when I went to plug it into the charger, I noticed it wasn't charging so I detached the charger and plugged it into a different charger, thinking that may be the issue...but that charger felt too loose...when I looked I realized it was loose because the port that is supposed to be ATTACHED to the phone was stuck on the end of the first charger...the port had completely come out! And even when I got it back in, since it wasn't connected to the internal components, it wouldn't charge...so then I had put in all this effort on a phone that I couldn't charge!I will say that Wireovia did get back to me (at hour 23 of their 24 hour time frame) after I told them I was returning it for a full refund. They were willing to replace the phone, but I was going to have to spend the money to ship it to Alaska (over $40 for overnight since I need a dang phone). I read more feedback than just this phone and realized they have a habit of sending refurbished when it says new....I'm sending this back to Amazon directly for the full refund and will be getting a different phone from a provider I can trust to send what they say!!Now I have to use my broken old phone in the meantime...please don't waste your time and get stuck with the same inconvenience as I did!",10,1

BlackBerry,"Solid product on par with Apple products. I have tried Samsung, LG, HTC...all feel inferior and the OS is not as crisp. This is the only phone that has ""quality"" feel to it. Battery and display rock. The only negative is that I miss the ""home"" button but you get used to swiping quickly.",10,5
BlackBerry,This device hasn't yet let me down at all! This device is seamlessly smooth and fast. With everything at the top of your fingers you can achieve any goal you have for the day! With the power of BlackBerry...Carry on!,10,5
BlackBerry,"I previously owed an Android phone and Windows phone. Here are my thoughts on a few features this Blackberry Leap offers.Built Quality - plastic body doesn't give you a premium feeling as those found in iPhone or Samsung's premium phones, but it never feels cheap. It is a solid phone on your hand.Camera - Simply, it sucks. Initially, I thought it's the stock camera app didn't excel. I purchased another high rated camera app from the Store but frankly the photo quality doesn't improve significantly. It's just not sharp enough. The worst thing is that the camera fails to focus quite often.Security - this is where this phone excels. Blackberry surely can keep its reputation with OS10. For most apps, you can control what functions to be allowed or denied by the apps, such as camera, mic, files, emails etc. This is not true for Android or Windows phones which only let you know what the apps will have access, but never allow you to individually pick which ones to give access right. Furthermore, if you lose your phone and anyone attempts to enter an incorrect password ten times to unlock your phone, the phone will start wiping its data. Peace of mind assured.Battery - Non removable, but really good battery life. For me, I can recharge it every two days. I use the phone primarily for checking emails, WhatsApp messages, surfing the Web.Storage - It has 16 GB, but it also supports up to 128 GB micro SD card. That should be enough for most people for storing documents or multi-media files.Apps - Very limited. Windows phones have even more apps than Blackberry Store, not to mention iPhone or Android. However, major apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter are available. I personally do not need to use many apps in my phone or play games using my phone. If you need to be entertained by tons of games, then you will be deeply disappointed.Call quality - really good. This phone has two mics so it can pick up your voice nicely. Its volume is very loud at its max level so it's less likely that you have an issue to hear the other side even you use your phone in a noisy environment.Blackberry Hub - it's a single point of accessing all your messages, such as emails, text message, notifications from apps etc. so you need not open each app to read or compose messages. However, one thing that annoys me is that you need to actually open the messages or mark them as Read (by tapping on the envelope icon) to get rid of the notification. Otherwise it will always show as new messages arrived.I hope by listing the pros and cons would help someone who don't have a chance of using this phone, especially those who are curious about Blackberry OS10.",10,3
BlackBerry,This is a great phone. It was very easy to set up out of the box. The screen has wonderful resolution. Decent camera. Decent sound quality. Call quality is great as well. I actually switched from my Nexus 5 to this phone. I think Blackberry 10 is an underrated OS. With the addition of the Amazon App Store (as well as an easy way to side load the Google Play store that I found out about) Blackberry has the apps to compete with the iClones of the world.,45,4
BlackBerry,"Obviously us BB users are a bit of a niche crowd. I'm 25 and got my first BB Z10 at 23.Why I like the LEAP:- Voice assistant is loads better than the Z10- Voice assist works when 1/8"" plug is in use (like old car stereo)- good price- (I have big hands) bigger but slimmer than my Z10 with 3800mA large battery- battery lasts all day, sometimes I let it go for 36 hours, I almost never plug it in throughout the day- 10.3.1 is faster than 10.2.1 even though Leap and Z10 share same hardware- leather/plastic dimple backing is not slippery, aka never slides off pants- no physical buttons, everything is mostly swipe drivenGripes on the LEAP:- keyboard is still great, but would have liked to see something new in 10.3.1- still getting used to the new icons in 10.3.1- no WebM support in browser (use AVPlayer for that)- volume +/- and pause rockers are a little snug, Z10's were much easier- Amazon app store is not GooglePlay, but you can find APKs of slightly older GoogleMaps and side-load- starting to navigate when deep in a city, native map struggles to find location, side-loaded googlemaps locates right away- Voice assist is not Google Now or Siri, but it does the simple things- I don't use the ""notes"" or ""Remember"" app, but people have said it changed pretty radicallyMy uses:- Emailing, zipping docs- Apollo (aka Pandora for Blackberry)- Music player- lots of web browsing- Native maps app- side-loaded older version of APK google maps as backup",27,5
BlackBerry,Ordered this phone as soon as it was available. arrived on time and was fast! Activated the phone the day it came and haven't had any issues. I'm proud to say I own a Blackberry again. This phone was worth giving up my iPhone 6 Plus that now sits in my drawer.,26,5
BlackBerry,Was pleasantly surprised by this phone. Excellent screen color. Bright. Phone is zippy and I love the ribbed back.,25,5
BlackBerry,Finally got the phone and the letters on the keyboard isn't even in English. That's not what was displayed. so now i have to return the phone and purchase it from somewhere else.,10,1
BlackBerry,I'm very disappointed because the keyboard is not the same with sample picture in this topic. I love the original keyboard. Why don't seller mention this for customers?,25,1
BlackBerry,I bought this phone specifically from this seller because of the positive reviews. When I received the phone I noticed a couple of features stopped working. O.K. I will admit I got worried. Returning items bought on the internet can be tricky and sometimes it is just not worth the hassle. This SELLER was WONDERFUL. They responded to my e-mail immediately. I returned the item and they sent a new phone. Everything is working and I'm very happy with the product and the customer service I received from this seller.,10,5
BlackBerry,"First off, I bought the phone as a replacement of my Sony Z3 dual.I've always been an android user so decided to stay with them. Current flagship phones are too expensive and I don't want to pay for it so looking into mid-tier phones or older flagship phones. I got an alert these were sold from Amazon (not some 3rd party seller) for 350 so I jumped on it. I figured if it didn't work out I could return for credit and buy the various other phones out there unlocked.Pros+ got marshmallow update fairly quickly through autoloader (real easy, everyone should be able to do it)+ large battery to get me through the day+ big screen, curved sides help with holding the phone+ mostly stock android with a few tweaks that make life just a bit easier+ scrolling with the keyboard is literally the biggest thing for me+ on screen keyboard has the best word prediction solution I've ever seenCons- a little flimsy, when i type on the onscreen keyboard there is a noticeable sound and bend or flex- wipe the front face of the phone might cause the slider to move- the back kind of feels weird and is plastic despite this being a flagship phoneMiddle* keyboard, so it's great to have a physical keyboard but it's also a bit small. I don't have large hands or fingers and I found it difficult to type using the keyboard. Also to hit the top row it's hard due to the slider portion just above it* wish it was usb C but that hasn't been commonplace until recently.*mute button, i guess it's good???Overall a great phone for the price, the initial unlocked price was just too much.",11,4
BlackBerry,"I thought I was buying an unlocked Blackberry Priv.. didn't know it was going to be an At&t Blackberry Priv. Also the SD slot does not work. It will not detect when SD cards are inserted. Also very difficult to get SIM card slot out of phone. There are scratches around the hole where you use the tool to remove it, seems it's not so new. Phone seems to be working fine, so far.. but has Android 5.1.1.. not Marshmallow. Overall not a bad phone, but not what I expected to receive when I ordered it.",26,2
BlackBerry,I have loved BlackBerry since my first Bold. I really liked the Q10 and the Classic but the Priv has my heart forever! The display is large and the graphics display beautifully. The use of the Android apps makes me happy to be able to choose from my favorites that I went without for years. The sliding qwerty BlackBerry keyboard is perfectly placed and while the touch keyboard is excellent; I am very happy to have the buttons to press. The addition of Google's apps is convenient and I am pleased with the camera. I love this phone and only wish I had purchased it sooner!,14,5
BlackBerry,"I am one of the few that switched from an android device (Galaxy S3) to BB10, and I am satisfied with the experience!About me: non-techie, not into gaming, not into tweeting, twittering, facebooking, or instagraming. I need a productivity tool for managing my part-time business, full-time job, and social contacts.Despite years of trying, I will never be able to function without a physical keyboard. I tried it with tablets, and I tried it with phones. Just. Does. Not. Work. No matter how sophisticated the ""swype"" technology or voice input, I never got what I needed out of a virtual keyboard.Enter this older-model Blackberry Q10, with the BB OS10. I like the build, love the keyboard, and with a bit of a learning curve, excellent usability for my purposes (a tool, not a toy). I figured if I liked OS10 enough I could upgrade to the newer ""Classic"" or ""Passport"" when prices dropped a bit. So far so good.I use it with AT&T prepaid service and get very good coverage. I am able to use the Amazon store for apps which I believe are android-based, but have not tested out that functionality yet.I subtracted one star because in some respects it's a little slower than my android device that is the same age. It doesn't lag or crash, but things like booting up, transferring data, or doing a a factory reset seem to take FOREVER compared to my S3.There is no ""home"" button so the user will need to get used to controlling the device with hand gestures. I have found that this feature makes multi-tasking surprisingly easy, rather than hitting ""back"" a million times or having to force close all of my apps to clear them out. I don't miss the gigantic screen or the gigantic footprint (I have a tablet for apps like Netflix when I am traveling).The transition was made easier with an app called ""Device Switch"" that essentially imports data from phone to phone wirelessly.A warning to buyers: I initially bought this phone ""refurbished"" from BREED, fulfilled by Amazon. It was described as factory unlocked and refurbished and came as neither. It was a T-mobile branded phone with significant cosmetic damage and speaker malfunctioning. I promptly returned and bought NEW (from a different seller).Overall I am happy with my final purchase.UPDATE:After a few weeks I can safely say my initial reaction remains the same. This is a quality phone. The security is excellent. Most android apps are available and generally functional (not 100% perfect mind you) through Amazon App Store. My favorite part of this phone (besides battery life & keyboard) is the native apps that come pre-loaded on OS10: weather, flashlight, maps, alarms, and a barcode scanner. They all work smoothly unlike my prior android device, where I had to often download 3rd party apps that made my phone buggy and sluggish.One drawback is that the screen could be a bit bigger. Though I love that it's small and sturdy, sometimes the hand gestures are not recognized correctly due to the size of the screen. For example, if I want to select some text in a message draft, I inevitably hit the ""attachment"" or ""smiley"" icon. Someone with larger hands might not find this so easy to work with.Otherwise, great job Blackberry! The ridicule for ""downgrading"" is well worth my peace of mind and productivity.",10,4
BlackBerry,"First off, I'm a lifelong Apple fan as far as computers go, but I'm certainly a convert from iPhone-- used the iPhone 4, 5, and the iPad Mini and replaced my iPhone with this when Sprint wanted to charge me $500 to buy a new iPhone 5S. As far as this product versus other Q10's, perhaps you're wondering about buying this versus the much more expensive black Q10 without the Arabic keyboard. They're identical-- except that this also comes with European/African power plugs, plus a flimsy but functional North American one (plus, who doesn't have a few extras lying around-- I sure do). So, that's convenient, and hopefully you won't be fazed by the documentation in UK English and Arabic (""learn about how to set up your favourite smartphone""). Next up, maybe you're wondering about buying this versus the BlackBerry Classic-- they're also basically the same phone. Same amount of RAM, same processor speed, same internal memory. The BlackBerry Classic has the old school buttons, which is fine, but not worth the extra $300 for me.It's important to note that when you buy the Q10, you're not buying an iPhone 6-- you're buying a BlackBerry. All of the badmouthing of the BlackBerry brand ignores the fact that this is not a device that is designed for watching Netflix or playing glorious games (although . Most people I know who own iPhones don't watch Netflix on their iPhones, and most of them write e-mails on their laptops. Case in point.Pros:-Most apps work great, whether Kindle/Android or native BB. I've downloaded Groupon, Instagram, various photo apps, AirBnb, a banking app, Shazam, NY Times, Wikipedia, Amazon store, a couple of Twitter clients, and it comes with Evernote and a decent note-taking app that can do voice memos as well. I'm having some frustrations with Facebook (native), but it works ok.-Size is convenient to hold in your hand, and the classic BB keyboard is great.-Ability to take notes during calls, for when a customer service representative gives you that super important phone number.-Durable. Feels more durable than any iPhone I've owned and comes with a free rubber+hardshell case.-Great battery life. My iPhone will often die before 11am, and this powers through the day even with heavy use. Charging doesn't go so fast, but I guess you can't win 'em all.-Call clarity is amazing and the speakerphone is super loud.-Swipe-up equivalent of the home button becomes extremely comfortable fairly quickly. I was skeptical at first, having gotten used to the old school BlackBerry buttonry and even the iPhone home button, but it works great and hasn't failed me yet.-Fast and not fazed by a multitude of apps and data.-Expandable, cheap memory. Comes with 16GB built in and you can get 32GB on top of that for $15 on Amazon.-Easy to customize notification settings and it's set up intuitively.-Screen is great.-When you close out of an app, you automatically see all of the open apps and therefore don't tie up valuable RAM running stuff you're not using (this was a peril on the iPhone).-The Hub works alright. I was prepared to hate it, but it's pretty convenient, and it's easy to navigate around to adjust settings, add new accounts, delete accounts, etc. It's sort of like a glorified home screen.-Transferring contacts was a breeze, and the OS actually automatically added a TON of stuff that I was glad I had-- notified me, for example, of a meeting I had coming up before I had even transferred anything over (I guess from an e-mail account).-NFC stuff is easy to use.-The Facebook app is imperfect but lets you conveniently use FB messenger inside the application instead of having to use a different application.-Included HDMI port.Cons:-Special multi-touch gestures aren't quite as advanced as the iPhone, which I find myself lamenting probably a few times a week on random stuff.-Included earbuds in headset are absoutely horrendous.-Haven't figured out how to set up a good Podcast app.-I haven't been able to get absolutely every app to work on this phone, but there are only two that I am going to have to ""sideload,"" those being Uber and Yelp (""sideload"" = meandering in command prompt slash developer nonsense slash upload download file conversion nonsense). I think that's a product of BlackBerry having relied on the Amazon Kindle/Fire appstore instead of Google Play. As the fates would have it, the Google Play website doesn't really work very well on the phone's browser, so you're sort of sunk until you figure out how to sideload Android apps-- which isn't quite a piece of cake but also isn't the worst. It's much easier to download apps on the BlackBerry than it was on my old iPhone because I don't have to type in my password every time I download something, so it's easy to try out new apps-- and there are plenty. But really, how many calendar apps do you need?-Notification LED, while fully customizable, is pretty weak and only illuminates on the front side as opposed to the linear LED on the Tour/Curve, which sort of sliced through the top of the device so you could see it in a holster or when it was lying flat. I really liked the Tour's function of the lock button an the mute button at the top-- they were hard plastic and easy to access. This has no such thing, just a lock button at the top. Which is fine, because you can easily swipe up to unlock and customize your lock settings (not to mention add hotkeys, which the iPhone lacks in any comparable way).-Special function button is inconveniently placed between the volume rocker buttons, making it clumsy and easy to press accidentally or hard to press intentionally. On my Tour it was on the opposite side of the phone, making it great for pushing with your thumb while your index and middle fingers could access the volume buttons.-Voice control kind of stinks, but then again, Siri ain't perfect neither. I find that it works okay for voice dictation, but it's very hard to ask your device, for example, where you can get a good meal in Grand Rapids. It's technically good, but not very smart.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied. Not entirely perfect as far as the not-mainstream app situation is concerned, but that'll get better, and it's great to have a community of die-hard BB fans who are always willing to help on forums like CrackBerry.",16,5
BlackBerry,"I ordered this phone and got it very quickly which was a pleasure. The phone came in perfect condition and is unlocked as advertised. However, the description states in bold that the phone comes with a 16gb micro SD card and original accessories. Up to now I cannot find this 16gb memory card. I have e-mailed the seller and am awaiting a response. I was very disappointed to see that I did not get this piece as I considered it a good part of the deal!",39,4
BlackBerry,"Unfortunately I can not says good things, I have complain about that Item...When i opened the case and checked the mobile, I saw 2G function is not working, only the 3G functions is working.Then I inform the Amazon about that incident.

BlackBerry,"I'm not exactly a BB person, but due to conveniences with my friends and family I decided to migrate to it. I looked at the options available and came to the conclusion that the Storm 2 was the best option. The phone is just great! the touchscreen works very smoothly and overall the applications are what I was expecting. The only issue was that I couldn't make the EDGE connection work with my carrier. The phone is fully unlocked for calls but you need to verify first if the data connection will work with your carrier. Out of the 4 carriers in my area, the phone only worked with 1 (All carriers are GSM/3G). Also, the phone didn't come with the 16GB microSD card. However, this was easily fixed by calling Amazon. They were extremely helpful and willing to give me a solution so I could get this card.",11,4

BlackBerry,PLZ ppl do not buy... these fones a refurbished fones i bought 4 shame to say some came scratched other missing screws an personal pics on them for ur own good shop somewhere else WIREOVIA is a rip off,21,1
BlackBerry,"Ok. so the supplier was prompt and courteous but the issues avoidable. I paid for two day shipping as i was due to travel the phone arrived after i left and only after i contacted the seller. Upon arrival and opening the box i got a used phone with scratches on the face plate, the wrong charger, the back plate is replaced with a cheap cover from another supplier. Upon opening to insert the battery the inside is dirty and has a green dust on the phone and there is no memory card. So decided to return only to realize i will now lose 15% restocking fee plus shipping ($81 or 18% cost of phone). Worst yet the supplier writes me to remove the bad review on the shipping problems as its bad for business. If the business was good i will not have an issue. Anyway the Torch is a great phone this is the third i am buying, the first from this supplier. Will never buy from here again.",166,1
BlackBerry,I ordered a new phone buy got a refurbished one. Could clearing see it was used didn't even need a close examination. Order new phones at a risk of getting a used one for the price of a new phone. dissapointed indeed.,138,1

BlackBerry,"Ordered this phone as new and when it got here, it turned out to be refurbished and not new. It didn't have the original seal and there were no user manuals in the box. You could clearly see that the phone had been used before. There were some light scratches on the back!",39,2
BlackBerry,"This is the second time I have bought a phone from this company. The first time they shipped me a REFURBISHED phone which deceitful people assured me would be ok. Just as the time to send back the phone had expired the phone stop working. Now for me I cannot afford to throw $100+ dollars down the toilet.I contacted them re their deliberate and malicious act of passing off old phones, but I was tossed around from one person to another. And after all was said and done, more was said than done.I lost money and jobs because I had to buy another phone.O the second phone I bought from bought from them stopped working as well and again, I was tossed to and fro by greedy money hungry people who rather to give inferior quality products with sub-standard service.I had a horrible experience with this company and if you wish to lose you money and get defective products buy from them. If you are like me and cannot afford to flush money down the drain choose a different vendor.I wish there was a section to say no star because these people deserve -5 star rating.",37,1

BlackBerry,Delivery was on time. Phone works fine except that when I plugged it in to charge it the touch screen stopped working. I had to turn it off a few times until it started working again. It seemd used because it had some contacts in the Blackberry Messneger.,22,3

BlackBerry,"I bought this phone for my girlfriend. I had high expectations for it since I've been a Blackberry user for years and the new os7 phones were touted as a major improvement over previous devices. Not only were our expectations met, they were exceeded. The phone is very fast, and the touch responsiveness is smooth and precise. It's a great looking phone and well worth the price. I'll recommend it.",23,5
BlackBerry,"I bought 2 of these from Wireovia. They were advertised as NEW. Neither of them worked properly from the moment I opened the boxes. I wanted to return them, but Wireovia made me buy another one and said they would give me a credit after they received the faulty ones back. Once I was out of pocket for 3 of these NEW phones, they refused to accept the faulty ones back saying ""it's impossible that both are faulty."" Luckily Amazon agreed to accept the faulty phone back and refund my money. DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH WIREOVIA! They sell refurbished phones as NEW. They lie!",21,1

BlackBerry,"I asked the seller if this was an unlocked (by the manufacturer) phone or if it was unlocked by them. They told me it was unlocked by the manufacturer. It is an AT&T phone that was unlocked by them (AT&T logo comes up when booting. ) I have had multiple problems with the phone from the start. It began with the keyboard freezing, where I had to remove the battery several times prior to it correcting. As the issue worsened, I finally removed the memory card. This seemed to correct the issue. But the charging port was loose after about 1 week of use. Now the phone does not charge at all and no one will fix it. I now have to replace this phone, which is NOT inexpensive. I would not recommend the seller - buy from a reputable dealer, where you can return the phone if it has issues. Outside of all this, I just viewed the BOLD which has the best of both worlds as well - keyboard and touch screen. I am going to switch - but I will buy in a store this time.",24,1

BlackBerry,I ordered the Torch 9810 because it's a good phone. No problems thus far. However when I received the phone there were one small dent on the black lining on my phone and a small piece of silver paint came off on another spot on the phone.

BlackBerry,"I ordered this phone cause i wanted to use it outside the US, and since it said unlocked, i reckoned it would do just fine. However, i got a scare when i received the phone and found out it was Sprint branded complete with a sim card and required activation. I felt so disappointed and since i already had it with me in Africa, there was no thought of returning it.I immediately went on the internet to buy an unlock code for it. The unlock code came in the mail, but while i was trying to figure out how to unlock the phone, i discovered that it was actually unlocked.I then put in my local sim and the phone kept on saying activation required. Despite that i put in the required local codes to activate the local BB network on the phone and to my pleasant surprise it worked and the BB line worked and i could make and receive calls.Despite this, the icon for my local network would not show, instead what is permanently displayed is ""activation required"".Anyway, I'm using the phone and it works well, although it is a Sprint branded phone.",38,3

Tethered to my 64G Blackberry Playbook, and also linked to my computer, keeps files, dates, appointments and reminders with no issues. Blackberry is on the right path with this product. Easier to access the battery, SIM and memory chip with the one touch removal of the rear case.

BlackBerry,I Had a blackberry Z10 best and fastest phone ever just think it and it can do it i was not getting tired of it at all everyday learning something new ! Now I went for the Z 30 wow even faster then the Z10 nice screen view in and out of your apps emails msg's what so ever very quickly !!! This is not a phone it's like you have a human in your hands very smart smart phone cool stylish awesome battery capacity THIS IS IT no regrets at all ! Some people @ me has Iphone 5s or the Galaxy S4 the Z30 can easily compete and beat them when I show some moves of the Z30 its jaw dropping !! Good job Blackberry !!!,10,5
BlackBerry,"Ordered form ACelectronics in Hong Kong because could not get it in US. DHL called to make sure I was available to sign. Nice touch snce I was out that afternoon. Came with Europe 210 charger and converter to US 110V. This is a awesome phone. Need to order Micro SIM since my old smartphone used Normal SIM. Screen is clear and the apps downloaded and installed fast. Everything works as expected right out of box. I like the 5"" screen as the text is easy to read and videos are smooth with good sound. Took some time to find the MAc address so I could logon to secured wifi site. The search for MAC addresss turned up no results because it is called ""Physical Address"" and is under SETUP\WIFI\ADVANCED.",52,5
BlackBerry,I have had Iphones and Samsung phones And blackberry phones. I have been most impressed by the intellect and effort put into the bb10 osOf course it is not a toy for teenagers but it is an absolutely quick and joyful phone to use. It has all the apps I needed and there are plenty of ways to adapt all DROID apps as well. It has an amazing battery life easily lasting me a day an half before needing charging. It has great autofill typing and usually I have an easy time typing .although I did like the touch keyboards a bit better. The screen display is crystal clear.it feels very light and it has great sound quality on phone calls. It has amazing reception. All in all a very five star phone thank you BlackBerry.,11,5
BlackBerry,"It's easy to read on its large screen, but still easy to fit in my pocket. Reception is very good, I have never dropped a call with it. It shows all your communication ( calls, texts, emails etc) on one screen, so comfortable to use. Typing is so enjoyable with its beautiful sound, predictable letters and even learn your words. Very easy to access to turn on and off your data plan to save money. You can set password to encrypt the phone and its media card. You can remote locate your phone and let it to make noise and what you want it to show on its screen and even destroy its data. it's swipe operation make it so comfortable to use.But it's not water proof. And there is no notes come with it telling you what to do if it's dropped into water. And their customer's service is incompetent.",11,5
BlackBerry,"The z30 represents a huge difference from my previous z10 unit. The z30 is peppier and quicker. It also has a better battery life. The 5-inch screen is just right for browsing, viewing YouTube and playing games. It also sits better in my hand compared to the z10. Overall, I love this phone!!",26,5
BlackBerry,"Recently received mine & there is no complaints so far. STA-100-2 works excellent down here in Latin America (Panama), phone is incredibly fast and responsive. Still uses my Z10 & Q10 but I must admit that the Z30 premium design is good to see and enjoy.The audio is outstanding. Good performance & quality on the multitasking. Transformer shell & Flip case fits perfecly.This is a must have for the enterprise person. This makes a great compliment to my Playbook as well.Good job Blackberry. This is the beginning of a great comeback with John Chen in charge of business,",12,5
BlackBerry,"The best phone ever, battery life is the best, is fast, OS improvements in 10.2 update are excellent, priority hub and message preview are a great.",19,5
BlackBerry,"I really relied on the Questions and Answers by Seller in the item description giving assurances this phone is the BBZ30 (Model: STA100-5) which is compatible on T-Mobile's LTE network. When I got the phone, I was out of town so the fact that it didn't immediately log onto the LTE network didn't cause me undo concern.But when I returned home, still no LTE where my other Blackberry (the Q10) picks it up easily. Yesterday, working with T-Mobile, I was able to confirm I was sold a phone that is not compatible with their LTE network. I received an STA100-2. I looked it up and it appears to be a Z30 designed for European networks.Now need to go through the pain of returning the phone and ordering a new one - this time, directly from Blackberry, which I probably should have done in the first place. Amazon said they are merely the shipper so they couldn't even do an exchange for the proper model number (my initial preference), though their customer service was outstanding as usual and makes me a very loyal customer to Amazon.This is the fault of the Seller who did not sell me an LTE compatible phone as promised. Buyers beware...",74,1
BlackBerry,"This is an outstanding device! I broke the screen on my black Z30 & decided to replace the entire device with the white one. It's looks amazing, and I've been getting a LOT of attention! No one believes me, at first, when I say it's a BlackBerry. The screen is stunningly vivid and realistic. It actually looks like something printed on paper!The new BlackBerry 10 OS (particularly after 10.2.1 released) is ahead of iOS, Android, & Windows. It is very fast & fluid, extremely intuitive (I tried a Nokia Lumia w/Windows as backup & hated it!), and has a ton of functionality that aren't found on many devices- especially iPhones! Here are a few examples of what the Z30 have to offer:- 5"" Super AMOLED screen (beautiful!)- FM radio built in (helps to save on data)- USB On the Go (OTG) - connect USB peripherals, including a thumb drive, keyboard & mouse, etc. Allows laptop like use!- Miricast - Ability to wirelessly mirror device screen on an HDTV! If the TV doesn't support miricast, there are small adaptors that can be used- Wifi Direct - Allows 2 supported devices to communicate, transfer files, etc. when there's no Wifi network.- NFD communication - Allows 2 supported devices to initiate connections by tapping devices together- Toast notifications (can reply to some!) - Allows you to see messages as a pop up as they come in!- Best browser in the mobile world- Best keyboard in the mobile world, and the predictive text with ability to swipe is AMAZING- BlackBerry HUB - Keep track of ALL of your messages from ONE place without having to open a GAZILLION apps! I have 5 email accounts, BBM, FourSquare, WhatsAp, SMS, Facebook, Twitter, & LinkedIn all in the HUB. I can see, reply, create without having to OPEN 12 different applications to stay up to date!BlackBerry finally hit one out of the park! The problem is that not enough people know about this great device. I do hope that changes sometime soon. If you're willing to give it a try, you won't be disappointed! I'm completely happy with my purchase, and I believe you will be too!PS - This Z30 is model number STA100-2. It gets 4G in the US on AT&T. I've seen others answer that this is the -5 model. IT's not.",73,5
BlackBerry,The user feels like the SmartPhone and it has been useful. It is easy to use and proven to be a good equipment for communication in a hard reach places.,10,5
BlackBerry,I bought this phone unlocked because ATT didn't offer it and I really liked my Z10. I switched out my sim card and everything worked just fine. All my contacts etc all showed up on my new phone. I don't know anything about the technical specs but its says 4G on my phone. This is a nice product if you prefer that BB operating system. This phone is priced substantially less than the new Passport.,10,5
BlackBerry,"I purchased the BlackBerry Z30 unlocked cell phone 15 days ago, after purchasing the Z10 unlocked in February, 2014. Unfortunately the Z10 was delivered with a defective camera, but AMAZON reimbursemed in full (very nice, :-)). After 10 months using the Z10 (it is a great cell phone, but the camera was not available), I decided to buy the Z30. I am not disappointed, on the contrary.I configured the phone to be locked after 30 min. To unlock it is really fast.The blackberry hub, already available in Z10, is a great feature, which avoids opening several apps and concentrates all ""comunnication apps"" (e-mail, whatsapp, phone calls, msm, bbm) in a sigle ""area"". This is truly very practical.The contacts are very easy to edit and, moreover, to ""clean"" useless information. By this I mean duplicated contacts, editing contacts information, etc. All very easy and intuitive.An issue I found is that JAVA does not run in either Z10 or Z30, which is a problem for JAVA-based apps.Some apps are beautifully designed for Z30, but there are not too many choices. It would be good if app developers dedicate some efforts to BlackBerry cell phones. Not all people use iPhone or other operational systems running cell phones.The BBZ30 sound is crystal clear. The camera works beautifully :-).But, the most impressive feature of Z30 is the internet connection: VERY FAST. When trying to use my cell phone, my friends using other cell phones were really very much impressed, as I am. Navigating with Z30 is an amazing experience because of the quick connection and fastness. A truly great feature of Z30.The Z30 design is very beautiful, although a bit big in size (but thin!).Overall I am extremely happy with BBZ30, but I must confess: I am a BB fan. Not everyone is supposed to use iPhone or Android, or other operational systems based cell phones. I have been using BB over many years, although it is considered by many people for ""conservative people"" or only for business man, what, to me, is a complete stupidity.Believe me: BlackBerry Z30 is a great cell phone.Update on September 20th, 2015: I am more happy than ever with my BlackBerry Z30 cellphone. The BlackBerry operational system has been updated a few times, with no trouble.But the most AMAZING FEATURE is the app BlackBerry Blend, which allows you to connect your cellphone in full with your computer and with your iPad. This app is great, not only because it works very well, but also because it is very practical. When in work, I don't have to stop using my computer or tablet if it is connected to BB Blend. I can see all messages, etc. Even better would be if the BB Blend developers would make the phone calls available through the computer or iPad (using an earphone), and also if the phone could access my computer and iPad. That would be absolutely great.BB Z30 is absolutely fantastic!",35,5
BlackBerry,"I HAVE NO REGRET YET USING THIS PHONE AND I HOPE I WON'T IN ANYWAY..I'M SUPER IN LOVE WITH THA APPS, THE BATTERY, THE SCREEN AND ALL IT'S FEATURES",11,5
BlackBerry,"I must say at first purchasing this device online i was very skeptical however the experience since doing soo has been lovely!!!Nooooo regrets absolutely none.Phone works wonderful,the speedy,timely delivery was excelllent!!Would most def recommend anyone to purchase this or any other phone from this particular dealer!",27,5

BlackBerry,My phone I think this is the best phone I ever bought while I was looking at phones to buy I settled for this one because all the new phones out there can't touch this one so I'm pleased,14,5
BlackBerry,"I used to be a blackberry user long time ago. Wasn't really satisfied with it. Software and hardware issue.Last blackberry I had was BlackBerry Torch. But I am proud to tell everyone here that BlackBerry Z30 is the best Smartphone so far. It's fast, reliable, amazing 5 inches display and good quality camera&video recording. Try it yourself!!!",16,5
BlackBerry,"This is an utterly outstanding device -- if you want an Android phone for the ""ecosystem"" and apps, this may be your next phone.I'll mention the worst aspect of the phone right up front -- the front camera (""selfie cam"") is not impressive at all. It's a 2MP, and I suspect the issue there is simply space; there wasn't room for anything bigger, so it is what it is.However, the bad news ends there. The rear camera is 18MP, and the image quality is outstanding. People claiming that it ""shoots slow"" probably have auto-HDR on and it's using it -- and by the way, it doesn't cheat -- it takes the full three shots before merging (most smartphones only take two.) The quality is out of this world. It's not a dSLR (I own a Canon 5d3) but even under pixel-peeping inspection at 400% magnification the images hold up well. The camera tends to overexpose highlights a bit BUT it has manual exposure bias control in the viewfinder; knock it down a stop and that goes away. Compression artifacts are well-controlled.Compared against the Passport's main camera (which I also own) the shooter in here puts the Passport to shame. It's not a $5,000 dSLR and lens, but it didn't cost $5,000 either. Qualitatively it's on-par with anything else in the market and the focus is phase-detect fast (nearly-instant.) OIS means stable video as well. The lens is wide-angle, probably around 28mm equivalent. I intend to get some ~28-35mm equivalent shots with both the Passport and my 5d3 in the next few days and will be posted a full review over on my blog including them.The keyboard is amazing and you don't realize how nice it is until you have the on-screen one up, it's taking up a third of your screen, you slide the screen up to expose the keyboard and suddenly you have the entire display page back. No other high-end device on the market makes this possible.The battery is a very large 3,400maH model. Like all Android handsets you can shoot yourself in the head in terms of battery life (e.g. using an ""active"" wallpaper, for example) and apps can as well. But here we have a new weapon in the form of DTEK and it's a BlackBerry exclusive -- it has already caught a couple of apps that when you simply hit ""HOME"" keep asking for position every few minutes, which of course turns on the GPS and does horrid things to your battery. Hit the square and close 'em completely, the problem goes away and your power drain while idle, screen off, falls to a very respectable ~25-30ma. In other words, close to 100 hours of endurance on standby. Will it go through the day? Yes, for most people if you're intelligent about not running apps that blow your battery up. The phone also has both QC 2.0 and wireless charging (wireless charge is slow, as with all such devices -- use the cable if you want fast.)The Hub is also present; it's a bit different than BB10 but the convenience of having all your emails and main social media account notifications in one place is not to be missed. And, the ""spark"" tells you which apps have notifications pending for them. Nice.I set mine up against my Exchange server and had my contacts, calendar and emails on the device in minutes; syncing has been flawless.The screen on this phone is gorgeous; you'd expect it from the specs, and it does not disappoint. It's also nicely usable in full sunlight, which many phones are not. And while it's OLED BlackBerry has managed to keep the over-saturation under control, the nemesis of color fidelity in a lot of these panels. Hats off to the folks who put the display together; they have a winner.The slider mechanism is precise and feels awesome. For that matter so does the back cover; it's a grippy carbon-fiber like material that has been used before; I believe it's the same as the Z10 and Z30 (I own a Z10.) The phone feels great in the hand and doesn't threaten to slip out and wind up on the floor with a smashed screen. Bravo.WiFi signal retention is excellent (better than my Passport by a wide margin) and cell service works well too. The phone is Band 12 capable if you're on T-Mobile; they're deploying a lot of it and this is one of the devices that can take full advantage of that. It has all the bands used by all the GSM carriers in the US and Canada; unfortunately it does not have CDMA so it won't work with Verizon or Sprint.Make sure to manually update all the BlackBerry apps when you first get the phone. There are updates for all of them on Google Play but the first time they won't come down automatically because they were not loaded from there originally, being on the device native. Once you update them manually the first time they will track on their own from then on. There are serious improvements in the updated versions on the Play Store, particularly in the Hub and Camera.For those who want an unlocked Android device BlackBerry has a winner here. This is a flagship phone and not inexpensive but the hack-hardening, keyboard and productivity apps that are proprietary to this device make it well worth consideration if you're looking for a flagship-level device.Recommended.Update 6/12: The black box, factory unlocked model will get Marshmallow when turned on. The orange box, AT&T model will *not*, so do check which you're buying -- Amazon itself sells the black factory unlocked model, but some vendors selling on Amazon have the AT&T unit which is functionally identical but cannot accept the factory unlocked firmware and are tied to AT&T for updates at the present time.",249,5
BlackBerry,"If you're like me, then 90 percent of the reason you're considering this phone is for the keyboard. In fact I went so far as to switch carriers, and take a more expensive plan just to get this phone. I have been searching for about 2 years for an updated smart phone with a physical keyboard. When the passport came out I was excited. I liked the look of it, but upon learning it ran blackberry os, I decided that it ultimately was not for me. So when the priv came out, imagine my surprise.My first 10 minutes with the priv were disappointing. I found the device clunky, buggy, and could visibly watch the battery life drain. On top of that the physical keyboard, which was the main reason I bought the phone, was difficult for me to use even though I do not have large fingers. Dismayed I thought about returning it, but the thought of having to re-port my number was even more unappealing. Do I gave it a chance and I will admit its growing on me. Here are my pros and consPros:The physical keyboard: pure and simple the physical keys are a godsend for me. I can't stand touch typing I honestly don't feel like that technology is really there for it yet. The privs keyboard, while not without several shortcomings is usable. I am finding that I get better with it each day and I by no means feel like I've topped out my learning curve. One feature that I'm really beginning to appreciate is that touch sensitive physical keys- meaning that I can type a please then simply swipe my finger upward if I like the one predicted word. If not I just keep typing with my accurate physical keys. Accuracy when you want it precision when you need it. Autocorrect when you want it and precision when you dont. One of my main gripes with predictive technology is that I have to frequently fight it to type words that I want, God forbid I have to type a proper noun or anything of that sort. The touch sensitive physical keyboard is also handy for navigation as you can use it to move around the screen and navigate websites without having to move your fingers to the upper part of the phone. The keyboard, for all its shortcomings is growing on me.Blackberry suite: if you're into that. The only thing that's been nice has been using the hub to sync all my email accounts, but I'm not a member of the blackberry cult so I don't use BBM etc. Overall I could take or leave the blackberry hub, this is android so there us a short third part app for everything that usually does what you want it to do.And for me... that where the pros really end. It has lots of ram but it doesn't feel well utilized...Cons:Overall design: I am really scratching my head on this one. I really don't understand what blackberry was thinking when they designed this thing. It's huge, unwieldy and the curved screen just seems to be something I accidentally rub my finger on and accidentally swap the screen. To be honest I don't get the curved edge screen thing, so maybe it's just not my style. The phone is massive as it is but on top of that there's a pull down keyboard. When the keyboard is slid out the balance is awkward. You cannot operate this device one handed. I am baffled about this. It's just uncomfortable to hold any way you try it. The main focus of the phone which I would think to be the keyboard is small and not very ergonomic. As I type my hands are starting to get cramped up.Heat: it gets hot, doesn't bother me but some other users were griping about it.Battery life: OK this part actually scares me. The battery life is atrocious. It's actually the main reason I considered returning the thing. I it's gone frome 84 to 73 percent from the beginning of this review till now. Yes I get it I am online, but seriously... I don't know how blackberry got away with releasing it this way. I will note that many claimed this is due to poor optimization and this may be the case. Other reviewers noted that there is a wearing in time , and that I should expect to wait 2 weeks for the battery to improve. If I will give it this: the battery life is improving but boy does it make me nervous.Buggy: I'm not sure why people say that android is inherently buggy because ithis hasn't been my experience. The bugs aren't bad... it's just not polished. Especially for the priceOther things:Camera seems fineThe phone is very slimLooks goofy with keyboard slid outThe back seems thin... I don't feel like this phone would survive a fall very well. It doesn't necessarily feel cheap or anything just fragile.I guess the bottom line is that when I pay 650 dollars (or more) for a phone I expect a pretty darn polished experience. I didn't feel like blackberry delivered. I can't say that I recommend this phone at that price. If it were in the 300 dollar range I'd find all these quirks a bit more acceptable.I will note this: the priv does grow on me as I use it more. I started this as a 3 star review and dropped it to a 2 because I really couldn't think of any pros other than the typing experience (which continues to grow alongside the battery life (hopefully)). I think if the UI gets some more updates and the battery stabilizes I will update to a solid 3 stars, but I can't in good confidence do that now. I think the main reasons I'm keeping it are more out of laziness and not wanting to go through the hassle of returning it. If that changes I will update my review. My recommendation to those like me who miss a physical keyboard would be to wait, unless you're feeling like burning some money. Wait for a significant drop in price, update in UI, or a different device. I wanted very much to like this phone... I really really did. Battery at 70 percent as I finish. Scratch that 69.",95,2
BlackBerry,"absolutely love it. one pointer i'd like to give people. I found the volume with the included headphones to be extremely low, you can improve it by using your Classic or Passport headphones and you'll see a 50% improvement on max volume",10,5
BlackBerry,"Don't buy unless you're on AT&T.Why, you ask? Because this is only carrier unlocked, not factory unlocked, the listing headline is incredibly misleading.You will only get updates for this device if AT&T approves an update (regardless of who your actual carrier is). Given their history with abandoning support for phones, you run the risk of having an expensive paper weight in less than a year.Don't believe me? Call blackberry technical support like I did, or go to the BlackBerry website and look up this exact question, which was answered by a forum comunity manager, a blackberry employee.",31,3
BlackBerry,"It's not new, I got it and found the box was opened.",12,1
BlackBerry,"I was so excited to get this device and could NOT wait. Sadly it's not available on T-Mobile, so I got the unlocked version on Amazon. I was very pleased with the delivery speed since it arrived the very next day. I had no issues with the phone since it was unlocked. I popped in my T-Mobile SIM card and immediately got 4G LTE and wifi calling on the T-Mobile network with no issues. I'm very pleased with the hardware, but I have some software complaints. The sad part is, the software apps that are lacking is available on the most basic of phones.Number one, there's no native gallery, video player, or music player app pre installed. Are you kidding me Google? This is either Google's fault or Blackberry, but what device doesn't have a gallery or video app? BB phones always had a gallery and video player app. Does a BB not need one since it is running the Google software? Doesn't stock Android come with a gallery or video player pre-installed? I am beyond LIVID!!!!. At 700 plus tax, there should be a gallery and video app. Even a 20 dollar pre-paid flip phone at Target or Best Buy has a gallery/video player app installed. Now I have to type the file name in for it to appear and than press play. Utterly ridiculous. The totally irony here is that BB preloaded the phone with their own wallpaper and videos, but you cannot access it because it doesn't come with a native gallery or video player. So i have to go into my text messages and pretend i am adding a photo to a text and sending it to a friend before i am able to browse the gallery and actually view some of the preloaded wallpaper and videos that BB included. Utter IRONY and RIDICULOUS!!!Also, some of the standard blackberry apps aren't here like voice recorder. God bless that password keeper is here cause I love that BB app. There is also no option to hide certain icons. The BB devices were famous for that. Even the Samsung Note 4 has it. I came from a Samsung Note 4 because i felt this was BB comeback device. In some ways it is and some way it isn't. I am going to keep it real with my review and list all the pros and cons.Pros:Build QualityLoud SpeakerQHD or UHD displayer (Whatever it is called and its above 1080P)Super AMOLED display makes the colors POPAndroid App StoreBB securityBB Hub (even though BB always had this and was previously known as universal inbox, but anyways!)Touch screen and qwerty keyboardMicro SD card slotUnlockedWorks on T-MobileT-Mobile 4G LTEWifi Calling built inCons:6 inch screen could have easily been doneSuper AMLOED display is not as VIBRANT as SamsungsBigger qwerty keyboard could have been easily doneEarphone port is on the bottom (hate that)2 MP front facing camera (REALLY???)No native gallery, video, or music player app (Seriously???)No voice recorder (Seriously???)No ability to hide icons (Really???)Had to download a BB app to make micro SD card slot workBB Hub (Can get overwhelming sometimes)Native internet browser should be pre-installedChrome Browser (not a fan of)OverpricedPhone only gets warm when chargingAt this price, a SUPER charger should have been included.Standard charger included and takes FOREVER to charge this massive battery.Hopefully a software update will be made soon to fix these things. I know most of my review sounds negative, but i do LIKE the phone, but i had to keep it REAL! I came from a Samsung Note 4 which i loved, but the Note 5 was a step back and i liked the specs of this BB so i came back and will try to continue using it to see how things go. I might go back and get a Samsung Note 6 when it is released in 2016, but not 100% sure yet. One thing is for sure, the BB CEO (John Chen) needs to make these software updates ASAP to fix simple nonsense.I'll revise my review after playing with it some more. Please enjoy the photos i uploaded.",12,5
BlackBerry,"It's a sad day today as I am returning my PRIV back to Amazon... Here's why:I am a smartphone poweruser with most my communication and e-mails done through the phone and on the go.I have an iPhone 6, hated it for the first half a year, but finally after the latest updates it works great (its been working great for 2 months out of 8 for me). But still I missed the Blackberry hub (which I loved on my Q10), missed the keyboard as I type a lot and hate screen keyboards for the constant typos.I wanted the PRIV so much and I wanted it to be great phone!!!The main reasons for not loving it:1. it is big - its larger than iPhone 6+ and much thicker; it is plasticky but I could live with that. What I couldn't live with would be a case on top of the BB - it would make it even more bulky, but I realised I would have to get one as the risk of dropping the phone is huge.2. it is slow - I thought I could live with that at first, but then I tried to take a photo - first the camera imaging wouldn't open - the screen was grey (no image on screen); after a restart the camera showed the image and took a photo, but the photo didn't appear in Photos (ex Picasa)! WTF? I thought I was doing smth wrong but I guess this was due to the fact that I was syncing a couple of photos with google drive in the background. But so what? Why wouldn't the app save the photo taken on the device? On the 3rd attempt it worked, although a lag was notable.3. BB apps are only acting as doubles for Google apps - BB hub runs on top of Gmail and messaging, not instead! First of all, double notifications - ok, learned quite quickly to disable Gmail notifications, so that only hub notifications would show up. But still it does not work smoothly - I read an e-mail, still shows unread, opened it again, close it, shows that it is read, but after a while - that it is unread again... Damn! After a while it refreshed on its own and showed that is read as it should be! Seriously? I don't want to deal with such issues on a daily basis! Deal with the background processes BB!4. The keyboard is not great, but should be better than on-screen, right?Guess what? It is not! In the end it is quite average in combination with the software as there is a definite lag about 30% of the time! (the letters on screen appear a tad later than typing sometimes) Come on! This was the main deal breaker for me - I bought the phone 70% due to the fact that it has a keyboard but what good does it make if it is lagging and results in typos because of that?Overall, I would say that the device is a tad above average - I would say 7 out of 10, and in my book it is not worth the 700 USD asking price!",23,3
BlackBerry,Love my Priv! You will not be disappointed!,22,5
BlackBerry,From BAF Distributors I ordered two of these phones. Both came AT&T branded and LOCKED. Be aware!!!,13,1
BlackBerry,"I am biased: I love BlackBerry phones. I owned the Bold and the Curve back in the early days of smartphones, then I got all caught up in the iPhone craze. I came back to BlackBerry when, to my surprise, I discovered they were still in business and making great phones. I ditched the iPhone, got a Q10 and then a Passport. I love, love, love BB10, the current OS. But, like a lot of people, I really missed some of the apps I used on the iPhone. Of course, BB10 can run some Android apps, just not all of them and some of them run poorly. Then I found the Priv. It's an odd but swanky phone that people notice and you'll enjoy using in public.First, let me say that it's a near-top-of-the-line Android phone, so if you like Android, you'll love the Priv. BlackBerry has tweaked the OS slightly and that tweaking seems to have improved the over all security of the phone. It comes with the Google Play store preloaded and that is the ONLY place to get your apps, unless you want to download APKPure, another great source for Android apps. Your BlackBerry apps are not available for the Priv. This is a BlackBerry phone in name only.Second, this thing is fast! I mean blazing fast. I used the Galaxy Note (not sure which version) to compare, and the Priv compares favorably, though the screen was slightly smaller. Speaking of the screen, it's a huge selling point. Streaming videos (Netflix or ones locally stored) look awesome.Third, the rear facing camera is slightly better than average. The front facing camera is not the greatest. So if you are a compulsive, narcissistic selfie addict, you'll be underwhelmed. The onboard photography suit is pretty decent, though.Fourth, the keyboards. Yes, plural. The slide-out physical keyboard is good, although the keys seem small to me. Mind you, I was used to the awesome Passport with it's large keys, so my judgment might be a bit subjective. Typing using the physical keyboard was a bit of a chore, and eventually I found myself slapping it shut so I could use the virtual keyboard, which is outstanding, I have to say. BlackBerry has scored with its virtual keyboard; it's far, far superior to the iPhone keyboard.Lastly, I give this phone 5 stars because it is a good piece of technology. People get all caught up in buying a ""name,"" like Samsung or iPhone, but the BlackBerry Priv holds its own in a world awash with good quality phones. One final point, the build quality is unsurpassed. This thing is tough; a lot tougher than it feels, which is to me, its only downside - how it feels in the hand. Maybe it's the slider mechanism, but this phone doesn't feel as ""solid"" as the Passport or the Q10. But it is, I assure you. I've dropped it a couple of times and you'd never know it.In the end, I still prefer the BB10 OS to the Android OS; it's smoother, prettier, and more intuitive. My Passport remains by favorite, go-to phone. But there's no denying that the Priv is a top notch smartphone that is hard to beat and fun to use. It was way overpriced when it first came out, but the price has really come down in recent months, making the Priv a wise choice.",13,5
BlackBerry,#N/A,13,3
BlackBerry,"First of all I am engineer, I am good at math, code, and technical specifications.. So you may encounter run-ons, fragments, bad formatting etc etc. But overall I believe I got my point across.Okay so I am kind-of a phone junkieƒ?? In the past 2 months I have owned an s6 edge, LG G4(H815 international version) Nexus 6p, and now currently the PRIV.I used blackberry when the Curve 8330 was popular and loved the keyboard and from there I went to the Palm Pre and using Android phones at the same time. The Pre still has that special place in my heart(Some of you know what I mean) and I think the keyboard of the PRIV brings back some nostalgia of those times.. Now onto the phone..REVIEW:I have been reading about leaks/rumors about this phone for a long time and honestly I wish they would have kept the name Venice over PRIV but the name is starting to grow on me.FEEL:The phone feels good in the hand, not as good as the G4 with the leather back but it is very comfortable to hold. It is much faster than the s6 and the G4 in everything but benchmarks but usability is what matters here. Not some skinned up version of android that forces me to have 60 extra apps I will never use and force me to root/rom the phone to remove them.SOFTWARE:The stock android experience of this phone is great, I miss the 6p except for its size unfortunately it was too big for me but even if it wasnƒ??t I think I would still be using this phone for the keyboard. But the PRIV feels nearly as fast as the 6p which has Marshmallow which is great as itƒ??s an Snapdragon 808(PRIV) processor vs the 810 in the 6p.All of the blackberry apps can be used or disabled if you do not like them. I gave hub a chance but canƒ??t get used to it. I like having my emails in the Gmail app and corporate in their own section. Also since the HUB does not support hangouts to me at this moment it is not useful. If/when the do support hangouts I will give it another try. I never had any heating issues that some have mentioned or any other software issues the phone feels plenty fast. The only time it has felt slow is sometimes in hangouts the physical keyboard lagged(Fixed with DEC 1st update)When opening the keyboard on the launcher screens to type and activate google now the keyboard seems to choose which keypress it feels like starting at. This is remedied by tapping the google search bar before you start typing. I imagine this will be fixed on an upcoming update but it is currently the only time the phone feels slow to me.HARDWARE:Keyboard: The keyboard is small, I have bigger hands so this was tough to get used to and the buttons seemed very hard to press at first but after using it for 2 weeks I am just as fast if not faster than on the software keyboard and the button presses are nice and soft now as the keyboard is broken in. The keyboard is the reason I paid $700 for this phone and I think it is well worth it.SLIDER:Every person I have shown this phone to has NO CLUE there is a slider and thinks the phone is thin and feel great in the hand and then when they see it has a keyboard they are amazed at how well it is hidden and how smooth it is.Processor, RAM, Screen:808 processor octacore is more than enough for daily needs for anyone. 3GB of ram and a nice QHD screen with vibrant colors, whatƒ??s not to love?Curved edges on the screen are a gimmick but I am a sucker for the charging icon. Keep in mind this icon is only active in a bright room. In a darker room the battery charging animation is disabled. No way to change this as of yet.Quickcharge and QI charging work great.Signal: The phone shows less signal bars than any other phone I have had but upon using actual dB readings the phone is receiving the same signal strength as the 6p and G4, do not remember what the S6 signal readings were.Design: The slider works well, sometimes when sliding I hear a very faint creak noise from the back it is minimal but a little saddening. But the phone is built great otherwise and there is no flex in my back-cover like some reviews units without the QI charging coils inside of the phone.I do wish the power button was on the right and the ƒ??convenienceƒ? button was on the left but that is being nitpicky. I use to think the convenience button was useless until I started using it to pause my music immediately when needed so it does have a positive but I feel it could be used as a dedicated camera button.Camera:Front facing is 2MP and is good enough for most people, yes itƒ??s not wide angle or 13MP like the HTC eye, but it is more than good enough for use when needed.Rear:With the newest update processing of HDR photos is much faster and focusing seems a little quicker. Overall the quality is comparable to the 6p or the G4 in auto modes. In manual mode the G4 blows both out of the water but Blackberry is adding more features (like in the recent update) and will continue to do so. Overall I would rate it a great camera in terms of cell phones. This is not a DSLR and you should not expect that quality from any cell phone. But it takes vibrant and clear pictures that look very nice and the detail is all there as expected. I have not had a blurry picture yet.Battery Life:I get about the same battery life I did with the 6P. I can get a full day with 3ƒ??4 hours of screen on time easily. I am usually listening to music for 5-6 hours of my 10 hour work day also. About 30 minutes of phone calls and way too many hangouts messages. A lot of googling is also done throughout the day.SECURITY:Blackberry tells us a large amount of things they have done to secure the phoneƒ?? We cannot verify any of this as it is closed source code. GPL requires the kernel to be released but does not require the proprietary underlying code where a large amount of hardening was done, or so they say. DTEK is on the phone and works nicely at telling me what apps are using my information (itƒ??s pretty nice to have actually) But overall we have to take blackberryƒ??s word that this phone is secured on hardware and software level.On Dec 1st Blackberry pushed out the December security patch update from google so it is good they are continually releasing the monthly patches meaning the Blackberry is at least as secure as a Nexus which are the most secure in terms of android security updates and patching.No fingerprint reader, I assume this was actually on purpose as most Corporate accounts do not even allow fingerprint unlocking, like mine, they still require pin or password unlock. The blackberry comes with picture unlock which is nice but I never use it as I use a trusted device (Sony smartwatch 3) to keep my phone unlocked when in range.Overall I love this phone and it may force me to not change phones for a while as it will be difficult to find something else that checks as many boxes as this one does for me. I most likely missed a lot in this review so please ask questions or critique as necessary.If you are looking at this phone for a great stock android experience but you do not think you will use the keyboard the 5X or 6P may be a better idea for the price but if you want the keyboard or the talked about security this phone is the one you will want.",19,5
BlackBerry,"The phone is very nice. This is more of a warning to people to confirm what they are getting. Most of these sellers are listing ""Unlocked Priv"" and are showing pictures of the factory unlocked device. Don't be surprised if you get an AT&T branded phone at your door. While it will be ""carrier unlocked,"" this is not the same as a factory unlocked phone. You will get the carrier bloatware along with being at the mercy of the carrier for your software updates.",18,4
BlackBerry,"Great mix between BlackBerry and Android. Not only does the phone provide a near stock Android experience, it adds some intangibles such as the physical keyboard for precise typing along with with top notch security and productivity apps.

HTC,"I purchased this phone for my husband so we didn't have to extend our AT&T contract. I paid a premium price for this phone, the same as a new one from AT&T and I expected to get a new phone. What we received was a previously sold and returned refurbished phone at a new phone price.I gave the phone to my husband on Christmas morning unknown that it was a refurb. My husband suspected it wasn't new due to cosmetic marks on it and when he went to the AT&T store to activate it they confirmed it had been previously sold and was returned under warranty due to a defect.Fast forward 3 weeks. My husband has had the phone and it has worked for the most part. It did have some glitches with freezing up at times and taking a long time to finally ring when he tried to make a call. Wireless also would lock on to a network and wouldn't let go even after leaving that network area so he would have to manually turn wifi off to get it to connect to the mobile network.... Very aggravating for a $500 phone.My husband put his phone on charge last night and turned it off as he normally does... This morning he takes it off charge and tried to power it up...Nothing! He spent the next hour trying to get it to boot up.....Nothing!He then takes it up to AT&T and they try several different things to get it to boot up....NOTHING! the phone is completely dead after only 3 weeks of ownership.My husband is livid I spent $500+ on this phone and the fact he now has NO PHONE.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!",215,1

The model number on the box even says its the HTC ""10h"" which is international version NOT the US version. Even the label on the back of the phone was a little crooked, also raising suspicion.

They don't mention this to you. Now you can get around the text messaging (you will need to download a program to your computer, then edit the program. The program will act as a proxy server for your phone and will fool the app market place into thinking you have a Nokia phone thus allowing you to download a Nokia program that will finally allow you to edit your APN settings for your texts) So you will be able to text but it will not fix you being constantly stuck on 3g, 2g, extended network, or ""H"" - You won't see much of any 4G speeds. Just writing this so people are aware (I didn't see this information posted anywhere when I bought mine and my wife's). Yes.... this phone is unlocked and you will be able to use your T-Mobile mini sim card, but you will encounter the previously mentioned issues/problems.",22,1
HTC,"When I received it, I was shocked at first because it looks like the vendor shipped me an European version with an European power adapter. Since I have another USB power adapter, I decided to plug it in and charge the new HTC wildfire S instead of shipping it back. After powering up the wildfire s, I was able to change the language setting to English and then it just works just like a U.S. version. Everything work very nicely afterward.This is a very fast cellphone come with a very nice camera. The phone is entirely unlocked and I am able to use my T-mobile sim card with it.Nevertheless, the vendor should really indicate that this is not a U.S. version phone.I gave 5 stars for the phone but 3 stars for the vendor.",15,5
HTC,"I ordered this phone to replace my iPhone 4 on the ATT network and use while traveling with overseas SIM cards. Additionally, I am trying to migrate away from Mobile Me and this looked like a great option. I really like the phone and the HTC Sense interface is quite nice. However, this phone does not operate on the correct frequency for the ATT's 3G data network, so all data is transfered via the EDGE network which has slow data speeds. Unfortunately, I returned the phone.If you want 3G speeds on ATT, make sure the phone operates on 850/1900 3G frequencies for data. Even tough this phone operates on 850/900/1800/1900 GSM frequencies the data frequencies are 900/2100 which ATT does not support.",56,3
HTC,"I got the international unlocked GSM model with waranty to use it all over the world!Now I set down in Brazil with a phone that freezes after 5 mins. of use. Have don all the suggestions HTS-support give about the freezing problems, but still keeps freezing!Tried to talk to HTC-support US they told me to contact HTC-Support in Brazil and Brazil told me to contact FRANCE!!!!...the biggest joke in the world!!!!!If you google the Desire you will find that there is a lot of people with the same problem and it looks like HTC don't have a solution to the problem!!!Therefor my recommendation for now: DON'T BUY THE HTC DESIRE PHONE at this moment 01.05.2011!!!!!My HTC repair ticket number from the US 10USCW52ENA001558 (if anybody from HTC read this!!!)",11,1
HTC,"I've been using the HTC Desire for about a month now, and I'm very, very satisfied with it. Purchased in the US to be used in Brasil, it is working wonders with a local service provider SIM.First off, the phone's design is not as groundbreaking as the iPhone - to me the iPhone 4 is the best looking phone so far - but it's not without its qualities. It has a clean and discreet design, and I like it that way.The Android OS with the Sense UI runs very smoothly with the 1 GHz processor built on this phone. The applications run slick, and no problems in multitasking. The screen is very sharp and very bright, the touch control is fast and accurate, pleasant browsing experience and lots of apps to boost your phone from the Android market.Call quality hasnt been an issue yet, no dropped calls so far. Signal reception is good, and call sound is... well, ok for a phone. The music player is very good, although it lacks an equalizer (I dont really miss it though, because music playback quality is good enough without EQ when using a better pair of headphones than the standard - I'm using the Klipsch Image S4).I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to steer clear of the control freaks at Apple, without any sacrifices (look for the reviews around the web, some sites rate the HTC Desire higher than the iPhone 4, and that means something).",26,5
HTC,As per the description we should receive unlocked phone but we received the locked phone that too in the AT&T Box.Not sure whom to ask and why they sent it like that. I thought Amazon is good in sending the items for the buyers but its kind of cheating the customers. Please be careful if you are buying this phone.,20,3
HTC,"The ChaCha is great... I knew what I wanted and this phone was perfect for me.. the QWERTY keyboard is nice big and spacy... The touch screen funcionalities are decent... With it 800GHz processador this phone is pretty decent and can handle anything as of now... I would only recommend this phone to ppl who like to txt, chat, of the like... Not a gamin phone at all... The down side which is a given or trade for the amazing QWERTY is the small size 2.4"" screen i believe it is... However the pixels this small size screen contains is beyond imagination packs the same pixels as high end phones... Due to it being a white phone... I recomend this to a clean freak type of guy... As well... Or else get a case for it... The other down side is that due it supporting such impressive screen, 3G, all means of chat and social networks... Drains the batteryyy very very hastely... So b ware of it.. it is a given that it will need to b charged every night... But if u use it more than avg it might require some charging durin the day...As of the supplier.. it was excellent... Got it in the time frame no much hassle",11,4
HTC,"Nicely built phone, nice specs, great price. However, it is NOT upgrade-able to Android KitKat as advertised here, and it suffers due to its extremely outdated software (HTC Sense 4+).Most likely, it WON'T work with LTE but it definitely works with T-Mobile regardless of what other reviews had said. Simply change your mode to Global or GSM and it will get pretty decent 3G speeds in T-Mobile.My biggest drawback is the obscurity of the model. Most people have never heard of this specific version (it is not exactly a HTC DNA nor Butterfly), and therefore, it didn't get the updates that the other versions got (Android 4.4). it's also impossible to find adequate ROMs if you wish to root it in order to update its software.Basically, is a phone with nice hardware that regrettably got stuck and forgotten with outdated software. Also: the screen is pretty impressive, but it has a horrible battery life.",19,3
HTC,"I had use the phone for a week. Strong signal, easy to use and navigate, right size, looks great, battery is holding 2 full days. So far I found just one issue: the calculator is really poor, it needs a serious update. The basic camera is average; however, if you play with the setting you will see a serious improvement. The construction is plastic, so I recommend a case. Compared to newer phones it looks just OK but the size and functions are above average.UpdateAfter few months, this is a great phone for the price.",11,5
HTC,"I bought this phone in order to use it on the t-mobile network, however, the Sim size of the phone is a Nano while I had a micro Sim card. After some cuts on my micro Sim card, I was able to make it work perfectly. Also, in order to get data connection for t-mobile you need to insert a network manually, there's several videos on youtube that show step by step how to do it. Other than that, the phone has worked perfectly and the packaging was perfect as well.",24,5
HTC,I was taking back that the phone doesn't use a regular Sim but a nano Sim which had to be inserted in the side of the phone that was a deal breaker for me cause I had gotten the phone for a family member overseas,22,2
HTC,"I got this mobile yesterday in AT&T Go Phone box. Its working fine when I use AT&T sim card, but when I tried to use LycaMobile sim card on the main screen its saying the message as ""Network Locked, contact customer care"" and asking to enter SIM Network Unlock PIN. Could someone please help what the process to use this for other networks apart from AT&T?",10,1
HTC,"I have had this phone for a few months now and it is one of the best phones i have ever owned. It is fast and easy to use and has amazing camera clarity. Overall, amazing phone.",10,5
HTC,"This phone is excellent, (THIS DOES NOT HAVE NFC) aside from that i am very happy and would recommend it 100% Great and different design, screen is really good against some reviews on the internet that say bad screen",12,5
HTC,The description of this phone is very misleading and this is why it previously got one star from me.If however you're on AT&T then awesome! Works like a charm so far with very fast loading internet.Screen brightness is a bit blah - but not a crisis for me; Expected better picture quality but alas and you gotta charge it every day even for me who is not a heavy user.Overall great value for money,14,4
HTC,The phone is fast and good. I am using as a spare for visitors. The only knock is that these phone is preloaded with bunch of bloatware from AT&T and it is impossible to get rid of unless you root the phone. The AT&T logo is also on the splash screen....,17,4
HTC,"SIM 1 (Slot 1) ATTI took the phone to ATT store to activate; the idiot in the store was more interested in playing with the phone then actually getting it to work. I left the store very unsatisfied. But the phone was working and I can make and receive phone calls and text messages.The phone does work on ATT on the first slot (SIM 1). With the DATA.I spent 2 hours on the phone with ATT to get this phone to work on their service.. Finally it did. Be persistent; and patient with ATT.This phone will work well on DATA plans in the US.. Unfortunately, U.S carriers would prefer that you use a handset locked to their services. At home, they'd rather you not swap in different provider's SIM. And while this last part is changing to some degree, carriers would prefer that you use one of their roaming partners when you take your phone overseas (they get some money that way).SIM 2 (Slot 2) T-MobileI decided to get another line activated since T-Mobile on the second slot.Make sure you understand, On T-mobile it works on EdgeEDGE is considered a pre-3G Technology. Which means it is VERY SLOW.. Like Dial Up.. the only thing this phone is good for is wifi..forget about trying to upload a picture to Facebook on this unless you are on wifi..Using the second slot (SIM 2) is best for 3rd world countries. Not the United statesOverall i love this phone.",24,4
HTC,I ordered this and it shows on the description that it is GSM unlocked. When we tried to open it it says it is locked in AT&T. It was a gift that I sent to Philippines. Now nobody can use it since we can't have it unlocked. Please resolve this issue asap,96,1
HTC,"My husband loves this phone so much as much as I do (different color) and he has figured out more than I have, he loves the quality of the camera, as it has a selfie (front camera) and photo booth style, also has beauty fix which makes ypur skin look better and pretty much fixes you if you'd like.Also it has the option to hide apps if you don't use them is good to have. Speaker is in front which makes it easier to hear when you turn on the speaker which has helped me to talk while driving.I like it is a thin phone and decent screen size for our taste. Just love it.",10,5
HTC,"This is a great phone. The size of it will take some getting used to since it is on the larger side of the spectrum. After a month or two though, I've grown accustomed and now other phones just seem small to me.The front facing camera is a true joy, and I'm the only one I know who has bought it so far. That's a plus for me since I hate to have the same as everyone else. The only thing preventing me from giving it a 5 star review is that the sound isn't as impressive as I was expecting it to be, but maybe my expectations were a little too lofty. It does still sound better than my previous phone though. Also, the small size of the side bezel also makes accidental touching of the screen while holding a bother too but these are all minor issues. I noticed recently however that my headphone jack stopped working. I thought the headphones were the problem but it's definitely the port. I'm not sure why, maybe it was due to something on my part, but the phone never dropped or anything so I'm not sure what it could've been.UPDATETurns out that the headphones were the problem and the phone remains in proper working order. Misdiagnosis on my part.",41,5
HTC,"Best phone I've had!! It's waterproof, the front led flash surprises people and I've had so many people amazed by this phone, if you want a phone that nobody has and is definitely top-notch, this is it. I highly recommend it",20,5
HTC,"I've had quite a few cell phones over the years and this is my favorite so far. I actually got this same model phone a year ago through AT&T's next plan which means I made payments on the phone every month. 4 months later I dropped it and shattered the screen and of course had no insurance. I have been using my boyfriends Samsung Galaxy S5 Active since then and all I wanted was my HTC again. I'm actually a fan of the galaxy phones but having used the HTC Desire Eye before hand I noticed a lot of things about the Samsung that were frustrating for me. I've done a lot of research on phones looking for the features that I want and this HTC is it. So when I found it on Amazon unlocked for $230, it was the best deal anywhere. What I love about this phone are the pictures and the speakers. Both cameras on this phone are amazing and I take a lot of pictures so that was important. I also watch a lot of videos on my phone, which was frustrating on the Samsung because the speaker is small and on the back so I was always cupping the back of the phone trying to hear. This one has speakers in the front so anytime I'm trying to listen to anything on the phone I can hear it loud and clear. The screen is big and the shape of the phone is light and fairly thin and I like the way it feels in my hand. I mean, I like this phone so much I've bought it twice now!",14,5
HTC,"This is a great phone. Very powerful and fast for this price point. I also want to dispel some of the conflicting reviews, questions and comments here regarding its operation on T-Mobile's network. Yes, this is an AT&T branded phone, however it is not locked. Just pop your T-Mobile sim card in and you're good to go. I get 4G LTE and full functionality on the T-Mobile network. The phone has the capability; If you are having trouble, it may be a settings problem (access point), or you may not be in a good reception area. For example, I I only get 4G and not LTE in my living room. But out on the street, I get LTE.UPDATE: I am having problems with MMS and WIFI Hotspot. MMS works, but only if you turn WIFI off. Haven't been able to use Hotspot at all - T-Mobile says it is due to AT&T software installed on the phone. I will contact HTC to see if they can help.",16,4
HTC,"I ordered this phone twice trying to give it a second chance because I was getting it as a gift. The first time I ordered this the phone came in a used box with the HTC sticker and an iPhone 4 sticker. Not only this, but the box contained a used iPhone 4!!!! I was extremely disappointed. The second time I ordered the phone the box was empty! Please be aware, there seems to be people who have had great experiences though.",10,1
HTC,"There are many, and I mean MANY, negative reviews out about this phone. However, you have to know what you're buying. Does this droid run like the new iphone? No. However, is it a reasonably priced decent smart phone? Absolutely! Here are some of the reasons I love it:1. Easy to Use and customize From the first moment I turned it on, I went through a sort of ""tutorial"" that allowed me to become familiar with the phone and calibrate it for my touch :). Also the very first day I started customizing it, with the easy of access Market widget programmed into the phone you can easily download apps to customize the look of your phone.2. Decent Battery Time Does the battery last forever? No, but in this day and age what does? Realistically this battery is amazing, I use my phone as a mp3 player- which it has great sound quality and easy to use music functions like shuffle and repeat and create playlists and other good stuff- and I like to play solitare whilst listening to my music and I'll do this for hours before my battery even thinks about moving. After like 3 hours of that plus another 2 hours of messaging and talk time with background sync and apps running (which you don't have to have your setting work like this but I prefer it to just so I can stay current with all of my updates) the battery will be a little low. However if its just on and I'm no really doing anything then it will last like a little over a day without neeeding to be charged.ConsSometimes it can run a little slow especially when I have messages coming in at once and I'm listening to music at the same time.The phone gets hot- like burn your face if you're talking for more than an hour hot- as for why it does this I'm not sure... However, I find if I pull it away for about 30 seconds it cools down, maybe its just my face? Maybe it because I'm hot ;)... Other than that enjoy the phone especially because mine was brand spanking new for only 40 bux :D",13,5
HTC,"A great phone, the only thing I can complain about is that the on-off button starts to get stuck sometimes, at the end I fixed it by downloading an app that alows me to use the volume buttons instead of the on-off button. The rest is perfect.",10,3
HTC,I was very happy with it when I recieved it everything worked great! This seller also did a great job packaging due to me being in Afghanistan my product got to me safe and sound.,21,5
HTC,"I really like it so far, fast, not too big nice display. Runs smoother than my droid 3. Running on Page Plus.Signal reception is maybe one bar lower than the droid 3 but i can live with that as long as I don't get the lag.Hopefully it will get ICS soon. Very nice phone",15,5
HTC,"htc droid incredible is a nice upgrade from the htc eris i used for two years, i like to buy the phones new out of contract once they become slightly outdated , they still work great but i don't pay full price or get locked in. so far the incredible has been very reliable and easy to use, battery life is just fine , i use the advanced app killer all the time. so far so good, i think one thing people fail to remember is that these are phones with small batteries that some ask to do the things of a laptop all day that has a battery 100x the size . realistic expectations are required and you will be satisfied with your smart phone.",104,5
HTC,"When I received the phone I thought it was in good shape, but I have immense difficulty when it comes to calls. I can't hear people and they can't hear me. Half the time the conversation is, ""Can you hear me now?""I won't even get started with the battery. Go ahead, turn off the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and turn off syncing. Download a battery saver. Download a task manager. It doesn't matter, at the end of the day this phone will be dead.",35,2
HTC,I was nervous when ordering this phone since I have always gottoen my phones from the Verizon store but have had no problems. works great. real happy. received on time.,30,5
HTC,Had problems finding a phone that works on Page Plus. So I ordered this phone because I had one before on their network and I knew it works great.,28,5
HTC,"Lost my blackberry so decided to get a droid. Bought an HTC Incredible. Listed as ""used"" when I opened the package, it was still in the original box! And it came right on time. Verison activated it for free so I was able to keep my plan the same. All is good!",20,5
HTC,"This phone arrived on time from the seller, as described and everything. The phone is exactly what I needed for my new job. The camera is good, it takes great pictures. The screen looks good and has good clarity. The phone is hard to bog down using a number of different apps. The only downside is that the battery took a while to charge (I charged it for about 18 hours yesterday and it got full, but that might be because it was new). All in all, a great phone.",13,5
HTC,Only had it for a week or so and it works great. i upgraded from the lg ally and this is wayyy better. Fast shipping and everything in the description was included.,10,5
HTC,"I am enjoying this phone very much. To pay under 200 dollars for a Re-branded One X is quite a nice treat. A word about the 16 GB memory on the phone... Only 2 GB is available for apps! While this is not a small amount compared to many mid or low range phones, I was quite surprised that this was the case here.... 9 GB was available on a separate partition of the same memory, so frankly HTC was just underestimating power users' demand.That said, App2Sd simplifies the process of moving many apps to the other partition, and I have yet to run out of space. The screen is a beauty, and this phone is a runway model in terms of looks, it is beautiful yet refined. The kickstand should be a standard feature on all phones, it is very handy. The memory card slot can actually take certain makes of 64 GB sdhc cards so do a search.The battery is average, and cannot be removed. However, aggressive power management sorts this out... Provided you are careful about the apps you install, for instance Skype is notorious for halving battery time. If you actually let the battery trickle charge from 85 percent to 100 you will see an overall increase in battery capacity after a few charges.The 4.7 inch screen is great to type on and looks gorgeous, in public this phone doubles your wow factor. The wifi is dual band, 5ghz has good range, and the phone does a good job for a phone of holding signal, and negotiation for bit rate. Since phones are limited by their size I suspect wifi signal will always be more problematic than tablets or laptops... This phone does well for its form factor.I have been pleasantly surprised by this phone, This was going to be a stopgap phone as I tried out Ting, I will probably not upgrade as soon as I had planned, I have no need.Two updates in the comments section.",12,5
HTC,"Good: The phone seems to work okay.Bad: I purchased this phone from Amazon, thinking I would get a new phone... it isn't. Upon my activation, I typed the MSID from inside my phone and Sprint couldn't activate it. Upon talking with customer service, she had me find a different MSID in the phone's software settings. She said the mis-match is often caused by different phone parts that are assembled during the refurbishing process. Amazon should look at this vendor for its product misrepresentation. This phone should have been properly labeled as a refurbished product. If I had known it was refurbished, I don't think I would have purchased it.",83,2
HTC,"I bought this phone right before christmas and over all the phone works really good. But the post is misleading because it says this is a new phone. This phone is not new, it is referbished and the reason why i am upset isnt because it is refurbished. I am upset because a refurbished evo 4g is $100 cheaper then this phone is. I paid 280 thinking this was a new phone and another seller was selling ""refurbished evo 4g's"" for 160!!!!! I am very upset because of this. Another thing is that the battery was bad. They sent me a bad used battery. Luckily i have insurance and sprint gave me a new battery for free, which would have been 40 if they didnt replace it for me, but i am very upset with this company. I love the phone but the company is HORRIBLE!UPDATE!!!!--If i may also add this phone is defective. about 3 months into using this phone the charger port got lose so i brought it to sprint thinking they could fix it and they couldnt. it disconnected completely from the chip?? I dont remember the exact verbage of what was wrong. so i had to pay another 100 as a deductible to sprint for them to send me another phone. This is the most misleading company i have ever ordered from. i will NEVER buy another phone from amazon EVER AGAIN!!! Id rather get what i pay for instead of spending over 400 all together just to get a new phone. Very dissapointed and upset.",41,1
HTC,I bought this HTC Evo 4G and it worked fine for a couple weeks and then one day just shut off and found out the mother board needed to be replace I would never buy from this seller again.,11,1
HTC,"I thought at first that this was a great deal. I was wrong, I ended learning today at the sprint store that I recieved a refurbished phone in original packaging with htc headphones and original paperwork.. After 4 days of recieving the phone, I noticed two screws in the back of the phone were loose.. plus the warranty void screw was modified. no wonder my power button came off!! This was not a new phone.. I was lied to... Just because they say its new because it has the original box and packaging doesn't mean its brand new.. refurbished...Don't fall for a scam..",12,1
HTC,"The HTC EVO 4G is a great phone, however the seller of the phone failed to inform me that the phone will only work for a few days! I guess that's why it had such a great price. I had sprint program the phone and update my profile and firmware, everything was great for a few days then the phone just stop working. I wasn't able to send callls nor receive any calls. I also couldn't use my internet as well as text. Thank goodness I had insurance on the phone. Sprint had to correct the problem. Buying a used phone from this seller was a bad idea.",12,1
HTC,The Wireless Circle - Amazon Marketplace DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PEOPLE BE AWARE I BOUGHT THE HTC EVO 4G REFURBISHED AND IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL I KEEP GETTING PROBLEMS THIS IS STRESSING ME OUT SINCE I LOST 184 DOLLARS CAN YOU BELIEVE IT I HAD TO TAKE IT TO SPRINT AND I NEED A NEW MOTHERLOAD WHAT THE HELL I'M SO MAD THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO REFUND THE MONEY FOR THE STUPID NOT WORKING PHONE BAD PEOPLE AND BAD SERVICE,24,1
HTC,"The phone I ordered had a lot more problems then the seller had metioned. The phone shuts off all the time and has water damage, I would ot recommend this seller to my fellow amazon shoppers. I'm very disapointed. I have already put money into fixing the phone whoever if this seller would like to make things right I believe a refund should be issued for false advertisement.",14,1
HTC,"My husband bought this phone as a replacement for his broken one. We thought it was going to work the same as the old one but this was pretty much a gem, It works faster and smoother than his Samsung Transform and so far no problems yet even though it is a used phone. I am glad to say that my husband loves his phone! :)",21,5
HTC,"I bought this phone to use with the Ting.com service. The phone was easy to set up and start using. Works beautifully. Since it is not one of the newer large screen phones, the slide out keyboard makes text entry very easy and leaves the entire screen for viewing. The Gorilla Glass screen seems indestructible.",13,4
HTC,"I ordered this phone once from a different seller and it was great, my son tossed it into the tub so I bought the phone again but from a different seller(this seller). I got the phone in great time and it was in great shaped until I turned it on. The touch screen on the phone did not even work. I contacted the seller and they responded asking me to send it back. This all happened in October of 2012. I sent it back in November. It is now almost March of 2013 and now they will not respond to my emails anymore and I am out 100 dollars because they wont give me a refund, but now they have the phone too. Never ever again.",19,1
HTC,I received the phone within a week. It was packaged well when I received it by the seller. It came with the phone and the (home) charger.I was kind of expecting the phone guide book and memory card but since it's used I didn't mind. The phone is brand new and in excellent condition. It's performance is awesome. It's fast and very easy to use if you're use to the Android system. The sliding mechanism is kind of hard to use to get to the keyboard but I figured after many times of sliding the keyboard out it will begin to loosen a little. Overall this was a very great experience and I would recommend this seller and phone to anyone.,14,5
HTC,"This is not as much a fault of the cellphone as the seller Ross electronics. I bought the cellphone in july 11 2012 and in september it started acting up by not charging corectly. As it was after the 30 day return window with amazon i decided to use my one year warranty via HTC. However when i called them up they said the cellphones IMEI number had been activated as of september 2011. Meaning my Warranty expired in september 2012!!. They basically sold me a one year old USED phone. IT ended up with me returning the phone to amazon in september 3 Months after i purchased it for a full refund. So Amazon really protected me and trusted me with my problem.So buyer beware make sure you contact the seller and verify that the cellphone is new so that you have a solid paper trail, and in case you did end up buying a used phone you can return it without a problem. It also is a very good idea to call the phone manufacturer and make sure the IMEI number is activated when you activate it, so that you know its new!!",99,2
HTC,"This phone does it all - almost. a great screen large enough to show movies with great definition. the camera and video camera both are great. The programs and applications offered are just amazing. my only wish was for more memory internally. the construction is great. Solidly built. If you don't mind the slightly extra weight then this is for you. On my belt, I dont feel it, but it starts to weigh in while holding it. not that this bothers me too much. My real complaint is the playback audio. Not that great. I would need to play with the settings some more to get what I want. WIth headphones no issues.The programs and responsiveness are good. You don't have to wait forever for applications to load up. In this regard it blows many other phones (BB) out of the water. With this phone that is significantly cheaper I dont feel like I am missing an Apple phone at all. yeah - refuse to call it what its real name is!",63,5
HTC,"Item listed as New and sold by Jet Set Market and fulfilled by Amazon. Item arrived in an AT&T box as expected. However, the phone itself is far from new. I am dissapointed that Amazon just chooses to do business with anyone. I choose this particular seller though the order was fulfilled by Amazon thinking that if anything it must be a good seller if Amazon fulfills their orders. There is a sticker on the outside of the AT&T box that lists IMEI number, serial number etc. I noticed right out of the box that the phone had visual damage to the front speaker part that is at the very top part of the phone. It it bent. Next I turned the phone over and saw that the ""label-cover"" that is screwed on to the inside of the phone (the labels containing the IMEI number, serial number etc where you insert your battery) was coming undone. Up close you can clearly see that the cover has been tamered with and see that the inside screws have been unscrewed before. Now granted, the phone is unlocked so I am fully aware that the seller had to insert a battery, power the phone up in order to unlock the phone, but there is no need to remove the INTERNAL battery cover, that is the battery cover on the inside of the phone not the outside battery lid/cover, unless someone replaced a part on the inside of the phone. As per another buyer's review who had contacted HTC for a warranty issue and then discovered that his phone had an IMEI number that had already been registed, I called HTC to check on the phone I had infront of me when I noticed that the phone I orderd has a serial number on the inside of the phone that is different than the one listed on the box. The box label and the phone label have the same IMEI number but the serial numbers are different. The HTC rep told me that this can be due to the fact that the ""motherboard"" of the phone could have been replaced. In such cases, they use the same IMEI number but serial number can change. In anycase, not only is the phone visible damaged on the front speaker, but also tampered with in the inside as well as serial numbers not matching. I contacted Amazon who issued a refund immediately and send me a prepaid return label. Needless to say, they offered to send me a new phone however just a few days after ordering my phone which was sold by Jet Set Markets (also listed as Samina Ladha) today Amazon is fulfulling the order sold by Ross Cellular. Ross Cellular was the seller who sold the phone with an already registered IMEI number to the other buyer I read a review by. I decided to take my refund and shop elsewhere. I am dissapointed in the sellers Amazon chooses to do business with but thankful that they refunded me promptly.Update: 11/15/12 . . . I kept my eyes on this listing and I noticed in the span of only a couple of days Amazon changes their sellers that they fulfill their orders from. Their computer system must randomly pick sellers they have an agreement with. Exact same phone and listing but new sellers every other day. Having said that, my experience is based on the seller Jet Set Markets (also comes up under name Samina Ladha). As a buyer who reads a negative review/experience look for the name of the seller, if listed in the review, as this will make a big difference in your buying experience. There are plenty of reviews on this site from happy customers. I just wish they would have listed who they actually bought from. I based my own buying decision on the positive reviews thinking it was the same seller as listed in the advertisement only to discover they change every so often. My advise, read through the reivews especially the negative ones and see if a seller's name is listed and stay clear from that particular seller. If another seller is listed under the phone you are buying that day, then make your decisions accordingly. Good Luck!If Amazon approves, I uploaded two photograph of the phone to go with my reivew. Look under ""customer pictures"" above.",33,1

HTC,"Does not work on T-mobile network as advertised. This is not an unlocked phone, it is an AT&T branded phone. I am so pissed. I just activated a new T-mobile account only to find out that this is an AT&T phone. It has AT&T right on the phone as well as loaded with their apps. T-mobile uses different frequency's than AT&T.",20,1
HTC,"So far so good, I bought this to use with Straight Talk service ($45 mo unlimited) and it does that well. Phone is very responsive, with almost zero lag switching between screens and loading apps. So far I'm liking everything about this phone (coming from Nokia E71). My download speeds, as checked on speedtest are over 5mbps, faster than my home DSL! Screen size is nice, being slightly wider than other phones I've owned, makes watching movies and reading web pages nice. I ordered the Case-Mate case and really like it, also the Zagg screen protector which is very good and easy to install without air bubbles. Wanted to note that battery life out of the box was not that great as with many touch screen phones, but if you can limit the amount of background apps running, turn down the display brightness a little, and have the lock timeout set at 30 seconds to 1 minute, battery life can improve quite a bit. I use a battery saving app called ""Juice Defender"" it will shut down apps and automatically adjust settings for the best battery life. I have no problem with the phone running all day during normal use, but if used heavily playing games or watching movies a car charger is a good idea.",13,5

HTC,"Yo siempre he tenido iPhone y tenia miedo del cambio por que no habio oido cosas buenas de Android, indistintamente que marca fuera, por fin me atrievi a comprar uno y no me arrepiento ni por un minuto, es un telefono super abierto, le puede hacer uno las modificaciones que quiera , la musica, videos, fotos etc.En otras palabras el sistema operativo es fantastico, Google ha hecho un buen trabajo, especialmete cuando lo actualice a Android 2.3.3 (Gingerbread) Ahhh ademas el telefono viene totalmente desbloqueado y listo para insertar el (sim card) y me trabaja perfecto con el ICE de Costa Rica, yo tengo el pre-pago de KOLBI y como les digo trabaja super bien.Lo recomiendo de la mejor manera, aun no logro entender por que estaba enamorado del iPhone cuando hay en el mercado telefonos como estos Android a un precio mucho mas bajo con una calidad igual a la de apple.Por cierto para activar los servicios de 3G del ICE KOLBI solo tiene que poner ""kolbi3g"" en el access point y listo... ya tiene internet 3G.Saludos.",17,5
HTC,"I purchased this product about one month ago and bought another for my wife. The phones were delivered on time. The ones I purchased online had no carrier logos but upon arrival I discovered T-mobile branding on them. So I thought 'ok, no problem - it's supposed to be unlocked,' and went ahead and slipped in my sim card. What I did not mention as yet is that I live in Trinidad and Tobago (in the Caribbean) and travel a lot, hence the purchase of an unlocked phone. Upon switching on the phone, I was greeted with a very cool green Android guy. Unfortunately, I could not get past that screen - because lo and behold, the phone was not unlocked (as advertised)!The only reason I did not automatically return the phones at this point (as advised by the Amazon Rep.) is because it would have been such a hassle to do so. That's only the first part of the problem. I then thought that I could just get the phones unlocked by those smart tech people you see in the malls all over the place... Only to discover that I needed a data plan to even get past the first screen (mind you, this was ALSO NOT advertised). The end result is that I ended paying about $100 each to get the phones unlocked and activated. I close by saying that the only reason this review did not get only one star is because after the headache I endured to get them unlocked, the phones are actually great phones. My wife loves hers and for someone who is not too interested in gadgets - she is absolutely hooked on hers. My advice is that if you live outside the US, do NOT purchase this phone - it might be okay if you live in the US (but I can't really comment on that).",140,2
HTC,"I bouhgt this 'unlocked' phone to be used with AT&T. I know AT&T insists data plan for smart phones, which I don't need, since I have wifi most of the time. But I also know AT&T closes an eye on non-AT&T smart phones. I'm very happy with the phone, except for a few problems that I encountered:1. The vendor did not disclose a crack on the back cover, and that the phone was actually locked to T-Mobile.2. The phone came with old firmware, probably Android 1.5, I couldn't tell, since I couldn't get pass the google log in (requires network data connection, no Wifi). This first generation firmware only works for people who have T-Mobile account with data plan.3. I went to a T-Mobile store and signed up for T-Mobile prepaid plan, got a new T-Mobile SIM card. But still no network connection. The T-Mobile store wouldn't refund me the $25 cash that I handed to them 10 mins before, although the contract says I can cancel it the first 2 weeks. I did borrow 2 separate T-Mobile SIM cards from them to try out, and no connection. 0 bars (APN info was programmed correctly). They told me to get another phone. At this point I thought the phone is defective, and I probably can only use it as a WiFi device.4. Then came a breakthrough. I downloaded Android 2.2.1 firmware to the flash card and reflashed the phone. This is a generic version without T-Mobile customization, and I can skip Google log in. Phone is up and running, connecting to T-Mobile. I did try almost every firmware that I could find on the internet. The phone rejected most of them for bad signature (probably T-Mobile specific signature), and some downloaded firmware are corrupted (too short). So if the file is smaller then 50MB, it is corrupted.5. T-Mobile wouldn't SIM-unlock it unless I wait 40 days and prove that I paid retail price for the phone. Eventually I paid $15 for a company that specializes in unlocking HTC phones to provide the unlock code (another company that can unlock everything couldn't unlock it. I'm waiting for a refund). Anyway, I now have it running with AT&T.Although this is a first generation Android phone, it works well with Android 2.2, very responsive. Sound quality is better than my Aria.",75,4
HTC,"Buyers please beware that this is an unlocked phone but still requires a SIM card with a data plan to setup. I'm not sure why HTC required the phone to have a SIM card with a data plan to set it up but it does. I use T-Mobile pay as you go. I simply switched to a daily data plan, setup my phone and then promptly switched my plan back to a pay as you go. I ended up spending a whole $2 to do this, no big deal. However if you have AT&T the setup is a little more complicated and you need a SIM card with a data plan. If you have a friend that has a SIM card with a data plan you can borrow it for 5 minutes and then use your own SIM card. Once you setup the primary gmail account on the phone you can use WiFi and change the SIM card when ever you want. I bought this phone for texting and calling and use WiFi for the data. The phone is really cheap compared to other Android phones, I hate contracts so I always buy unlocked phones. This is a great fit for me. However at this price point HTC had to sacrifice a few things, one being the processing power. It can be a little slow compared to other $500 android devices, but at being 1/4 the cost you can't really complain. One other minor annoyance is the headphone jack. In order to use headphones you need to use their adapter which plugs into the mini-usb port. The adapter does allows you to pause and start music without pulling it out of your pocket and using the GUI which is nice. But this means you can't charge the device while listening to the headphones. For the price this is a great phone.",10,5

Enjoying the amazon.com excellent service and customer service throughout the years, I sent the product to my friends the exact way it was received from amazon.com.Upon receipt of product at the country of destination, it became evident that the product was not new and the it was a T-Mobile LOCKED phone and not an HTC Unlocked Android Phone in a factory sealed box.Imagine the disappointment of a 9 year old girl receiving a REFURBISHED, LOCKED brick which cannot be used with a local SIM card.Due to the costs of shipping and the duties paid at the country of origin, returning this phone to the USA for it to be returned to amazon.com, makes no sense. This phone ended up as a paper weight.Very disappointed with amazon.com false advertising. Very untypical for amazon.com to mislead it's customers like that.",11,1
HTC,"I received this phone on time which was great. It came in new condition and the second I insert my SIM card everything went smoothly. I got my G-mail account set up, put in my contacts, installed my Bluetooth - ready to go. This is my first Smartphone so I have low standards at this point for functionality.It's fast except going on the internet, I think it's a little slow on that part; but I am patient. What frustrated me the most was I am unable to download apps like Facebook and Fifth Third because this device is too old. That was a huge bummer! However somewhat relieved there are a few alternatives in the App store for this phone.Other thing is not getting picture messages, but that has been an ongoing problem and doesn't relate to the phone. I will resolve that later, though. Not a huge deal.The Bluetooth is great as I love the hands-fee device. It works fine but the Bluetooth signal truly sucks a lot. If I am 10 feet away or if the phone's in my pocket the other person can't hear me very well and I have to set the phone near my head which practically beats the purpose of a Bluetooth.The battery is very bad! To the point I bought a second one just to last me the whole day. The charging takes hours without using it. I am not a huge texter or caller these days but it doesn't take much for this phone.So you may wonder why 4 stars from all these negative things. Well, it's a 4 because it's very user-friendly I think and easy to use. Setup was very easy and everything works. Got it early and in perfect condition. Had no issues like the other reviewers did. But I do wish we could use today's Apps and it'd be nice to have a better battery, too.So if you are looking for a decent Smartphone to start out with, buy this. Just beware of the battery drainage and lack of Apps.",12,4
HTC,"...but there are a few things to be aware of:1) Know Which Hardware Version You're Getting:If you're going to buy one of these, ask the seller which one they're selling to you. Essentially, there's a Chinese version and a Taiwanese version. The Taiwanese version has an inferior display, and generally isn't a good candidate for mod enthusiasts who want to 'root' their phone. Determining the type of Mytouch 4g in one's possession is as simple as looking behind the battery for the ""made in _____"" sticker.I noticed someone gave this phone a one-star review because they got the Taiwanese version and wound up disappointed. I wound up with the China-made version, and my experience has been quite the opposite--it's a wonderful phone.2) ""Stock"" vs Custom Firmware, Battery Life: For the common phone user, the stock software (the rom) on this phone is fairly solid. For android enthusiasts who like their custom ROMs (*cough*, Cyanogenmod, *ahem*), this phone is an absolute beast.From my experience, I've never had any issues with performance or stability with HTC's stock firmware (Android version 2.2 at the time). It is very responsive, and all of my 50+ favorite apps from the Android Market worked very well on it; however, I wasn't very impressed with the battery life (even without any of those 50+ apps installed). For whatever reason, it seems as though there was something slowly, consistently draining the battery--even while leaving it idle and unused.The official, updated 2.3 firmware from HTC supposedly addresses the battery issue, although I've never tested that for myself. After rooting my phone and installing the ever-popular Cyanogenmod firmware (7.10 / Gingerbread), I haven't looked back. The battery life has been incredible ever since. After tweaking a few things, I've been able to leave it on standby for a few days and still have a decent charge left, or use it pretty heavily throughout the day without the need to recharge it.3) My Usual Rant About Other Reviewers:This may or may not contribute to your impression about this phone, but I feel it's worth mentioning (as I usually do for my other product reviews) for the sake of doing justice for a product that gets 1/2-stared for silly reasons.* If you don't like big phones, then the MyTouch 4G probably isn't a good fit for you. Please don't buy a phone with a large display and then complain about its size. It's like buying an SUV and later complaining about the gas mileage or curb weight.* At the time of this writing, this is one of the very few phones with a front-facing camera to be had for under $[...] used. Realistically, most front-facing cameras on any gadget lack the fidelity & resolution of the device's main camera. Like every other phone, this one's front camera was meant for video chat--not professional photo shooting. If you expect more than that, please become familiar with this easy-to-remember formula when buying *anything* in general: ""Features. Quality. Price. Pick two."" All-in-all, this device is very well-rounded on all three accounts. Yes, of course it could have better [insert xyz] here. But for what I paid for it, it's one of the best phones out there for meeting all of my needs (good hardware specs, video chat, tons of custom roms available, wireless N, nice display, etc, etc.)* From my experience, the speaker quality and volume for this phone is about on par with the previous 4 Android devices I've owned. I don't expect to use the loudspeaker as a noise-maker at a football game, a personal home security alarm, or a replacement for my frequently-used car-horn in crazy traffic. For what it's worth, I can hear my wife/kids/boss/best-buddy/annoying telemarketer from across the room with this phone just fine.* I am reviewing this product in a product review section--completely separate from my experience with the seller I bought it from, and without consideration of the shoddy on-hold phone-based support that most companies provide these days (if they provide anything at all). Need I say more?",134,5

HTC,"My only reservation in ordering the nexus one was due to the few reviews I had read that describe difficulties with getting the latest version of Android onto the phone. I need not have worried as the update to Gingerbread was already downloading over the air almost as soon as I had switched on the phone.Delivery was preternaturally fast, and the phone works out of the box with my t-mobile prepaid sim. I am able to order their pay as you go daily web pass for data usage via t-mobile's m.web2go.com/myaccount/ page on the phone's browser.I have tried out various smartphones and the nexus one seems to equal or exceed those phones' capabilities. My impression is that the only problem that kept the original 'google phone' from becoming wildly popular was the high price for an unsubsidized, unlocked device. The price now 18 months after the nexus one's launch is phenomenal, considering the phone you are getting for that price.",13,5

HTC,"This phone has been fantastic. I upgraded from the original Samsung Galaxy, and definitely wanted to get away from Samsung. My old Galaxy seemed to be exemplary of what you get from Samsung - a product that is initially great but quickly begins to slow down and wear out. My guess is that Samsung uses a lot of cheaper components in their phones, which makes them cheaper to manufacture and to satisfy demands. That might be great for the customer who wants to turn over their phone every year or so, but I like to stick with my tech for a while, at least until something significantly better comes around.Overall I love this phone, and have been using it for several months now. I guess I'll describe the features of the phone in a bit more detail below. As of right now, I can't name any specific complaints with the phone.===Aesthetics===This phone is gorgeous. I wasn't sure how I would adapt to having such a huge screen, but I can now say that it was really easy to get used to it. The screen is ample and the resolution and color fidelity is impressive. The aluminum body gives the whole phone a feeling that makes you recognize just how care and thought went into the design and fabrication of the phone. It also matches my MacBook Pro really well, which is just a fun little bonus for me.I couldn't bring myself to put a case on my phone. I'm a very careful person, especially with things of high value like a smartphone, so I think I'll be okay. After a few months of regular usage there are little to no scratches on the body, and I still get to enjoy having all my friends drool over the phone when I take it out.===Speakers===Probably the first thing that just really impressed me about the phone was the very loud and nice sounding speakers. I'm very picky about sound and audio quality, so I'm not comparing them to the great sound you get from things like Swan, Klipsch, etc. That being said, these speakers hold their own compared to built-in laptop speakers and blow other phones out of the water. It's really nice for watching videos and listening to music when you don't have a dedicated speaker to connect your phone to.Keep in mind though, the speakers are LOUD but they can't really compete with ambient noise. To get the most out of listening to the speakers you will need to be in a relatively quiet place that has some decent acoustics so the sound can resonate a bit. For example, they sound great in my bedroom which is a relatively small 11'x10' room but the overall effect diminishes when I play them outside in the courtyard or lawn. This, of course, is to be expected with any sound system so you can't really complain.===Camera===I was really excited about the camera for taking low-light pictures in concerts. The first time I tried it though, the camera just totally failed to produce any good images. I know quite a bit about photography, so it seemed to me that the software was trying to compensate for the average low-light by really blowing out the ISO. This would normally work to produce a terribly quality picture that is nonetheless, in focus. Unfortunately, since concerts are generally a blend of extreme darkness off-stage, and VERY bright lights on-stage, this ends up blowing out the stage and the phone can't figure out what to focus on. I basically got a lot of blurry pictures of what looks like glowing humanoids in a dark room.I was pretty disappointed with the results, especially after comparing photos with my friend's iPhone 4. Knowing the specs of the camera, I feel that this is largely a software issue, and frankly if I had full control over ISO, shutter speed, and aperture I could probably get this to take great pictures.While there isn't a way to control shutter speed and aperture as far as I can tell, you can control the ISO. So the next concert I went to, I capped the ISO at 100 and voila! The camera was able to distinguish the band, and take really pretty good pictures.After figuring out what I needed to tinker with to get good pictures, the camera's other software and features really started to shine. The continuous shooting option allows you to take a burst of images and select the best one, which was great for capturing dynamic moments on stage. Another feature I've come to love is the panorama shot (outside of concert-photography of course) and the Zoe.I originally thought the Zoe was kind of a dumb gimmicky thing, and part of me still does believe that. However, it is really kind of cool to have you gallery of events on your phone, complete with little mini-movies that just makes it easy to feel like you are relieving the moment. Sadly, there are no good ways of getting these files off your phone.There's a lot of other great tricks as well, which I haven't fully explored. If you're interested there's lots of articles out there on getting the most out of the HTC One's camera, I'd recommend giving them a look.===Performance===Really not much to say here besides the fact that the One is just blazing fast. It's fast at everything it does. The only time it isn't fast it's because the data connection is crap, but that happens rarely in Boston.===Blinkfeed===I kind of thought I wouldn't like this unremovable feature that comes with the One. I definitely changed my homescreen, but I often find mysel fusing Blinkfeed. I'm really, really, really, busy. I'm sure a lot of you are also really busy. For me, at least, this has translated to me being pretty far removed from what's going on in the rest of the world. That's where blinkfeed comes in to provide me with something I didn't have super easy access to before - news! It's all right there, constantly updating a feed of news based on what you're interested in. It's like having an electronic newspaper on hand all the time. For that reason, I've really loved it.That's about it in terms of the features that immediately come to mind. Hopefully you've found this review helpful. If you're torn between getting the One of the Samsung, I would really recommend the One. I have owned many Samsung products over the years, and have had many friends with their products as well. Overall, they just don't seem to last very long. I feel that Samsung is just under the impression that its customers won't be keeping their products for much longer than a year, so they don't build them to last much longer than that.If you want a solidly constructed Android phone that will both last you a long time and offer you everything you could want from the top smartphones on the market today, this is your guy.",12,5
HTC,"Overall is a great phone with high build quality, but here's some design preference that came up to me after using for a month (originally an iPhone 5 user):Plus:-Luxury feel-Greatly built-Superb screen-Rich Dual sounds-Fast CPU speedNeutral:-I'm used to holding the phone with left hand and turning the volume with my left thumb (iP5 & S4 are on left side). However, this tiny, thin volume button is on the right side, forcing myself to hold the phone w/ my right hand instead of left.-No physical buttons to turn on the screen, resulting in only the power button to turn on the screen (S4 is a better design as it is located on the side for easier access).-The power button is flat on the top of the phone, causing inconvenience to find the button every time I turn on the screen. The button also get scratch up easily as it acts as an IR blaster. If they separate the IR and power button would be better.-The sense Home and Back button are not as consistent in sensing, which can cause frustrations at times.-Only two buttons on the bottom instead of three with an awkward design of Home button on the bottom right instead of the middle (This causes user to use the second hand to access Home instead of one hand due to the button either too far from the left thumb or too close to the right thumb)-The reception never gets full bar maybe due to the aluminum cover (my max is always 3/5 even on the streets)?-Takes a long time to fully charge (2 hours vs 30min. for iPhone 5)-Poor quality hand-free as recipient can't hear clearly unless I hold the mic up close to my mouth.*For personal preference: Although HTC One seems to be better than S4 in many aspect, S4 seems to be a better transition for iPhone users than HTC One.",14,3

HTC,"About Me: I have been the Apple fanboy for the past few years. From the 3GS to iPhone 5S and Macbook and iPad geek. Never owned a flagship Android base phone. I am an average technology geek look for high end technology at low budget costs for good features.Impressions: Since the M7 to the M8 Leaks, I had fallen in love with the phone. The elegant and classy look just compelled my eyes. I knew I had to have this phone. The front speakers and overall appearance of the phone stole me. I went in blind to the Android world.The ""M8"": I have been using the phone for the past 5 days, and I have to say I absolutely love the phone. Everyday I learn something new about the phone and it surprises me. The fast processor loads programs in a flash then multitasking is amazing.The so called bad crappy is not of an issue to me since im not a big camera fanatic and it shouldnt be a big judgement on the phone. Personally, I find myself having so much fun with the camera from the 3D dimensions to the unfocusing and stickers. The front speakers are really amazing sounds like concert coming from the phone. The 5 inch 1080p display is amazing to watch videos and just gaze at your phone. The slim design makes comfortable in one hand. The catches other iOS users to analyze my phone consider actually buying it. Its great phone and I would recommend to everyone. Never worry about space with the extra MicroSD slot.Pros:-Sleek & Elegant.-Front Speakers-Camera Effects(find your self becoming a photographer)-Face Recognition unlocking-4.4.2 Kit Kat-Motion Launch-MicroSD(Up 128GB)-Ultra Fast load times.- Control your TVCons:-UltraPixel Camera(sometime you can notice it, not a big concern)-Not waterproofPersonally to me no real cons.Good phone to transfer over to if your a iOS user.",200,5
HTC,"I ordered one of these today, and after seeing so much about it I can safely say that I'm pretty psyched! I would recommend this to people who enjoy tinkering with new Android stuff like I do. This won't be my main phone (that honor goes to the iPhone 5s) but will go on a second line meant for whatever Android phone I want to mess around with. I think HTC has done a nice job developing and building a quality product that is quite competitive!",10,4
HTC,"I don't even know where to begin describing all the ways this phone blows all others away.This phone is everything the tech sites boast it is and more. The processor in this thing makes a world of difference. Apps and widgets open in the blink of an eye, web pages load at blazing speeds and the phone boots up almost instantaneously. The last time I experienced such a leap in speed is when I first used my Samsung Galxy S3 and iPhone 4 after using a Blackberry Curve for so many years. The difference between the speed of the One M8 and S3 is like apples and oranges. A Ferrari 458 vs. a Hyundai Veloster.The display on the M8 is stunning. The screen on the this thing makes the one on the S3 look like a CRT display from 1998. And speaking of the display, my biggest (and best) surprise came when I used the phone outside in direct sunlight. To my amazement, I could see the screen perfectly, unlike my S3 (and other phones) which was impossible.The form factor of this thing is it's strongest quality in my opinion, and one of the reasons I picked this over a Galaxy S5 and iPhone 5s. You will be hard pressed to find a phone that looks this good AND feels this comfortable in your hand. I did notice the volume buttons felt a little loose, but it's not a deal breaker. The phone feels sturdy and ready for war, it feels like it won't turn to powder (iPhone 4, 4s) or dent (iPhone 5, 5s) if dropped. Although I would recommend getting a case to put it in. I haven't had any yet (*knocks on wood*), but I can see the potential for the back and sides of the phone getting minor nicks and scratches. I ordered the Spigen?? [Non Slip] [AIR CUSHION] HTC One M8 Case and amFilm HTC One M8 Screen Protector 2014 Premium HD Clear. The case hasn't arrived yet, but I can say the screen protector is EXCELLENT. They weren't lying when they boasted about the clarity and protection this thing offers.The OS is great too. If you're familiar with Android operating systems, it won't be hard to adjust to this phone. Although it did take getting used to having no physical home button and navigating the menus, but that's not necessarily a bad thing (I like newness). The camera, despite what some apple fanboys and tech reviews claim, is actually really good. The images are clear and the colors are rich, and with a little tweaking of the settings, it can compete with any other camera (on a phone) out there.The battery is also a strong suit of the HTC One M8. I was initially worried about purchasing a phone that didn't have a removable back cover, but now I know it was for nothing. When I first opened the box, it had a 47% charge, which would have lasted me, but I decided to charge it fully. The next day, the phone only lost around 30-40% charge after more than 18 hours of light to moderate use (facebook, instagram, email, whatsapp, music, youtube and internet browsing). With heavy use, I can see getting at least 10+ hours. In standby mode, I can see this thing lasting weeks. Needless to say, the battery is great.Now, onto my only gripe about the HTC One M8, the speakers. Don't get me wrong, these are the best speakers on a phone that I have experienced, and having them facing forward makes a world of difference. When the volume is up, the speakers are very crisp, clear and bass rich. However, after reading so much about Boomsound, and then actually hearing the phone, I was honestly expecting a little more. I know that I have to take the audio file quality into account (which I do), but I wasn't expecting to have to turn the volume up to the level I did (almost max) to experience what HTC so proudly boasted about.After all is said and done, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants the best piece of pocket tech available.Pros:-Super fast-Very lightweight/excellent form factor.-Battery life is amazing.-Great display.-Can actually use the phone in sunlight!Cons:-Dual front speakers not as loud as I had hoped.-Volume buttons don't feel very well constructed.",10,5
HTC,it does not mentioned it's a Verizon version M8 in item title. It costs me extra money ($25) to get unlocked bootloader. never come back!,35,1
HTC,"Being an engineer, the HTC One M8 seemed like a sure bet. Here's the problem: this dev edition phone has super serious overheating problems. HTC has also run out of stock for this developer edition phone, so if you've got an RMA for the to process, you're going to wait a month to get something back from them. And after all is said and done you're going to own a phone that's way too expensive for it's own good. The M9 is out, but I'd probably avoid that and stick with more appropriately tested and loved devices elsewhere.And I'm skipping over the normal stuff about malfunctioning cameras, very easily broken screens, etc. Steer clear if you're trying to find a deal on a slightly older M8.",32,1
HTC,"I replaced my old HTC Sensation XE with the new One M8, and i must say, i'm loving it! It's super blazzing fast and snappy. And i really like the fact that it has two front facing speakers for true stereo effect. I definitely recommend this phone, you won't regret it.",12,5
HTC,"It is a beautiful piece of hardware, but I just don't understand why people think the Duo Camera is a good system. I think it is terrible. Most of the photos are completely blown out and there is such a crazy difference between the HDR and regular auto mode that it is like two completely different cameras were used. Plus the image quality is just plain fuzzy and lacks detail of other comparable phones. It's a real head-scratcher that the HTC developers chose this route. My Nexus 5 consistently delivers sharper, more true colors and better pictures across the board when I take the same picture using the same setting with both phones. I guess if I wanted to tinker with all the settings on the M8 camera, I would rather plop the $649.00 down on a nice DSLR. In a market where the camera is fast-becoming the deciding factor for consumers' choice of cell phones, this one is a really huge disappointment.And though the M8 is beautiful, the aluminum body has to be covered by a case to be used in everday life and that's a shame, because it ironically defeats the phone's stellar hardware design. My Nexus 5 has not had a case since I bought it in February, and it has survived several drops with aplomb. Plus, I just love its sleek minialmist design, and slim, lightweight profile. After loving my M7 and switching to the N5 until the M8 came out, I personally think my phone does not have to be a big statement piece; rather it needs to be functional, simple, elegant, fast, sturdy, and have the ability to take a really nice photo quickly and without a lot of fuss. I am constantly being complemented on the photos from my Nexus 5. Constantly! And at the half the price of other flagship phones; the Nexus is a keeper.",24,3
HTC,"The phone that I got was scratched on the back. It had multiple scratches, some of them are deep and I can't help but see them constantly. It was not mentioned that the phone condition is that bad. I need either replacement or refund.",20,1

HTC,"its awesome phone, I use to have a HTC m7 but this one is much much better than any other phone.I do recommend to buy it as the material and the software are perfect and not like Samsung Cheap plastic.",14,5
HTC,"Has great speakers, looks and feels fantastic and runs fast, however, it lacked the main thing I needed... being able to talk to people. The microphone came defective and it seems to be a common issue. A quick Google search for ""htc one bad microphone"" will show what I'm talking about. And what's even worse, this issue has been around since the previous HTC ONE (the M7). Which means that, even though HTC had years to find a solution, they seem to have ignored the issue and persist today.Again, the phone is very beautiful, runs fast, feels great in the hand, and has the best speakers of any phone I've played with. Just be ware that you might get a phone with a defective microphone, which is the main feature some of us want from a phone.",15,1
HTC,"phone isn't bad per se although the camera blows - it's about at the nexus 4 level. the only thing worse than the camera is htc service. my camera lenses got scratched after a short period of time. that is, the protective coating of the lenses got scratched which apparently was a known problem. htc agreed to fix it under warranty and, for a holding authorization against my credit card, would send a loaner. long story short, after some time i get a nearly $300 charge for ""other repairs"", nobody could specify exactly what was wrong or why they did unauthorized repairs to begin with. the entire idea was to get ""my"" phone back after the repairs. after countless hours of emails and phone calls and lots of apologizing from htc service people ... i ended up not getting my phone back, getting stuck with a sub-par refurbished unit ,and eating the charge. horrible company, terrible service, so-so product.",16,1
HTC,"I was really excited about getting this phone, when I opened the box everything seemed to be ok but I then found out that even though I bought a brand new device and was marked as one, they sent me a refurbished phone. I didn't notice at first but once I check the content inside the box I had no doubt that it was a repaired phone sold as a new device. First, it didn't come with the sim card removal tool, second, it didn't come with htc OEM headphones but generic headphones instead, (look for unboxing videos to check how the original headphones look like), Third, it didn't come with the original HTC silicone case, finally, when I turned on the phone for the first time it was already set up (I had no option to add my Google account, or change the language which was Chinese btw). so far I haven't found any issues at all with the device but I'm not sure if it's going to last. I will try to update later.",10,2

HTC,"I had HTC DESIRE HD, great phone got it 2010 and still working, battery last about 50%, and the phone lags but after 4 years of work is amazing that still works. That's the first reason I decided to stick with HTC, and the one M8 promise to be handsome phone. Comparing with the competitions S5, as far as performance they are quite the same, maybe a difference in the camera. The Samsung has extra features like the fingerprint scanner, the hart rate monitor, etc that can make the difference if you enjoy having a phone with many feature. But for me is the daily working, and I got to say the phone beats S5 in daily use, the sound is amazing never heard a cell sound like it, the phone is the best looking phone in the market, the screen performs great outdoor with direct sunlight. And about the camera, maybe not that much megapixels but ultra-pixels performs better in low light environments and many pictures are taken in those conditions, in other conditions you will get good pictures. I'm getting about two days of battery life with regular/high use, remember I just got the phone, and when you get new toy, you usually play with it extra time to learn all the features. I got de European model because of the 4g band with Digitel in Venezuela. The phone picks 4g, and I got to say it really makes a difference upgrading to 4g, my patience is less stress. I recommend these phone.",16,5
HTC,"THE CELLPHONE DOES NOT COVER THE T MOBILES 4G LTE BANDS FOR THE USA. SO, THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVICE IS NOT ACCURATE. IT COVERS THE 2G AND 3G BANDS. IT IS AN INTERNATIONAL UNLOCKED PHONE, BUT IT IS NOT A T-MOBILE CELLPHONE.",18,3
HTC,I give a four star cause I expected way more. I've had htc one since the release of the M8. After switching through different cell phone companies I've had to buy the M8 over and over again with no complaints. I've also owned several droids and iPhone in the past so I'm no stranger to call phone market. While yes this phone is a very good phone to have if you have the M8 I recommend staying with it. I can tell almost no difference at all as far as speed. Yes the camera is better and its a kinda a different design but not enough to fork over the obscene amount that cell phones cost these days.,57,4

HTC,The phone is an international version and doesn't work on T-Mobile's LTE. It will only connect to T-Mobile's HSPA+.The phone also doesn't come with HTC uh-oh protection.Good-It is unlocked-Rooting doesn't void warranty.-Cheaper than the domestic versionBad-No Uh Oh Protection-Doesn't work on US LTEYour best bet is to buy a used version on E-Bay for under $400 and you will receive HTC Uh-Oh protection automatically.I won't be surprised when Amazon start selling these as open-box/refurbished items for Christmas.,15,1
HTC,"Extremely dissapointed !!!I received the phone in September 11th. Since couple of days my phone sometimes it's turning off and I can't turn it on for hours, or it's freezing for couple of seconds , the LTE it's not working with T Mobile . 2 days ago I contacted the seller and I told him my problem and asked a refund, something normally. After 48 hours (today) he told me that the returning period was passed, so that means , I have a 519 $ phone which can die anytime, thanks a lot seller!!!! Really dissapointed !!!",16,1
HTC,"This is a really nice phone. Great feel in your hands; great looks. It's super fast with its octa-core processor, just adding to its overall smoothness, complementing the physical design. I hear that the GPU (graphics processing unit) isn't as zippy as the one in Samsung's S6. But, I don't use it for gaming. Might use it for videos down the road. It's like a very small phablet, light enough that you can hold it for an hour or more late at night if you want to catch up on reading or dash off emails you couldn't get to during the day. The screen is super sharp! I've used it heavily on wifi for 2-3 hours at a time, which only drains the battery about 30%. Not bad. What a phone!",15,5
HTC,"The full sized HTC One was one of my favorite new mobiles of the year. It was solid in the way that Apple hardware is solid and no one else is. But the screen was just a bit big for me and I couldn't reach all the way cross the screen. I traded in the larger one for this one. I lost some cash but got a phone that I really love the size.Everything about this phone is perfect except it's not the screamer that the full sized One is. Expect a bog down here or there on heavy processes-- that being said, it's a great phone once configured and updated and I'm happier with this than almost all other android options today.",38,5
HTC,"HTC One Mini (M4) is a great phone esp if you want a sleek and premium feel to your phone. I got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I have an HTC One M7, which is amazing as well but this phone is the best that I could find with a smaller screen (which was one of the most important criteria for my wife). Its easy to handle, less bulky, and still has all the goodness of HTC One M7.The seller (HeavyDuty Electronics) was awesome to ship the phone on priority when I contacted for a quick delivery. All in all, a great experience!",14,5
HTC,"This phone is incredible. There is no way to describe it besides THE BEST. The only thing that I don't like about it is the battery. The battery is not very good for all day heavy use, but it will get you through the day as long as you don't use it ALL day and use the power saver option. It is smaller than the original HTC One, but not by much. I don't really see it as ""mini."" Many people complain about the camera, which is not a concern for me because it's actually very good and it has a lot of fun effects. If you want a GREAT camera, then buy an actual camera. It's great to quickly capture those important moments. A thing that I love on this phone is Google Now. Totally check it out, it's such a treat to have. The graphics on this phone absolutely blow me away and so do the speakers. All of my friends and family are really jealous of my Mini, even when they have awesome phones.",14,5

I got it to work but it was intermittent. I ordered another phone and initiated a return easily thru Amazon.",17,4
HTC,Excellent phone. Works great. Does everything u can expect from a smart phone. Has horrible battery life. Would have given five stars if it weren't for battery life but I would definitely recommend. Overall very happy just have to keep a charger handy,12,4
HTC,"Be careful, the store that sold me this E-C-R or something store is a new seller, scammer. Posts all the specs of the real HTC s720E which holds a quad-core 1.5GHz processor, nvidia Tegra3 chipset and 32GB. When he sends it, it is this really weird clone, although I admit that the retina display is quite real, certain things are just not right, for example, the fact that the android version in it is 4.0.4 and is not upgradeable in this clone. Additionally, the phone came with no IMEI, yes NO IMEI!!! Therefore the phone could not be put in a network. I got a pretty clone of a paperweight. Again, STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER OR HIS PRODUCTS!",18,1
HTC,"First off I can say that this is a really great phone, large screen, great reponse time, and very sleek looking. i purchased this phone originally hoping it would be new. When I recieved it I could tell it was a refurbished phone then on top of that the power button doesn't work.Not only did I pay, and was promised, a new phone. I recieved a used and broken one for a new phone price. I have tried to contact the seller AEG wireless numerous times for a refund but they have not answer back any of my emails. I have now contacted amazon about the matter and luckily I work at amazon so I know the matter will be dealt with. Bottom line... Do not buy from AEG wireless, they are so unprofessional.",16,1
HTC,"PROS: Hardware, screen, ICS, HTC Sense (yes I think it is a pro!), cameraCONS: Battery life, no replaceable battery option, missing dedicated search keyRecommendation: If you are ready to compromise on the battery life then this is a definite BUY from meTo be fair, I knew what I was getting into when I bought this phone. Excellent hardware as long as you don't count battery as part of the hardware!On very basic usage like talking, texting and moderate browsing and with the screen brightness set to auto, you can probably get about 8 hours of battery life out of this.But with about 45 mins of Pandora, push email, games and basically the things the phone is actually meant to be used for, you will find yourself charging it twice in 8 hours. My average battery life on fair amount of phone usage come to about 6 hours. This includes about an hour of actual phone calls, some online chatting, about an hour of pandora and few games in between to kill time.But enough about the problems. The phone has lots of good stuff going for it.The screen is just brilliant. I will not get into the tech specs of it, but as an end user, I like what I see when it is displayed on this screen.The camera is fast as promised though I still feel it takes a little longer to launch than I would have liked it to. Once launched, the picture clicking is fast and smooth. As you may have read elsewhere, the camera is good, but don't throw away your SLRs or point & shoots just yet.The phone is fast and there is no doubt about it. I have done fair amount of multi-tasking on it and it did not seem to have an adverse effect on the performance. But I do like the ability to be able to actually close each app unlike earlier versions of Android.My one gripe with the design is the elimination of the dedicated search button at the bottom. I don't know why it was done away with as it was really useful and I am not saying that just because I had gotten used to it on my HTC Desire HD.I like the uni-body design except for the fact that now I dont even have the choice to replace the battery. Not that I did so with my old phone, but that was mainly due to lack of tech support from HTC while trying to get the right battery.I know people have been complaining about the 'limited' 32 GB of which only 26 GB is actually available with no option to expand. Personally, it is enough space for me. I do not intend to store and watch HD movies on a phone, even if it has a 4.7 inch screen.I also like that the phone came with a 25 GB dropbox account. It seamlessly connected with my existing dropbox account and simply added the additional space to my existing account. HTC Sense has a lot of integration with drop box, such as the ability to attach files in an email from your dropbox folder by sending a short url in the mail (mind you this is different then the standard option of 'Sharing' your dropbox file via email). However, this drop box integration exists only when you use the native Email app and not the Gmail app (whats up with that google?). Frankly, while google is doing a lot of great things, it needs to get its act together on integration and support of its own products. I have seen a trend that new google products are better supported by third party apps than google itself (for the longest time google docs worked much better on IE than google chrome!).Face unlock is cool but a novelty and not so much of a utility. I would have called it a utility if I did not need to press the power on button to first wake up the phone, then slide the HTC Sense lock screen to unlock the phone before even reaching the face unlock screen. There is a reason it is featured under the security tab.I am still playing with the phone and will update this review at a later date with more information.Update1: HTC released an OTA update yesterday which is said to improve the battery life along with other minor bug fixes. Today was the first day of use with the new update. The phone shows a remaining batter life of little over 50% where as in the past it would be between 30-40% by this time of the day. I will post an update after playing with it over the weekend.",136,4
HTC,I ordered up and paid a hefty fee for what was advertised as an unlocked international version of the HTC One X. Global Mobiles sent me an unlocked One X that had a T-Mobile Germany software build. The phone had a T-Mobile boot up screen and was full of T-Mobile crapware in German. If you are selling a real unlocked international HTC One X then it shouldn't have any carrier branding whatsoever. Luckily enough I flashed a custom rom shortly after but it was quite annoying to not receive what I paid (proabably too much) for.,73,3
HTC,"I received mine from ""Worldwide distributors"". The options for language are taiwanese, vietnamise, English (Singapore), etc.I made the mistake of assuming international would be Spanish, French, German... if anything.Anyway I asked the seller for instructions on returning the item (used 15 minutes), and they just told me to contact the manufacturer and suck it up.",10,1

I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this, it's probably not going to be what you expect for the hefty price. I don't get 4G--even when it tells me ""4G."" There's nothing I can do about this now, sadly, but for anyone else who wants to buy a phone I recommend trying to find a store instead",20,2
HTC,Not happy at all.......... Bought two new HTC One X 16GB Unlocked GSM and received two used one with missing parts and open boxes. Yes i got money back but what a hassle. Amazon stood by me 100% through all............ thanks Amazon.,13,1

HTC,"I have tryed several brands from iPhone, Sony Experia, LG, Samsung (GS3) and HTC.This One X+ to update an HTC Desire HD. Previous to receive the One X+, I tried the Samsung GS3, which is an awesome mobile phone, but the user interface seems cheap against the sense interface in HTC phones. The only feature I would miss from the GS3 is the predicted text, quite honestly prediction text on the Samsung is amazing and I would say this is the only feature I think it beats the HTC, but if you buy or already have Swift key from the Android store you won't miss anything.I have two cell phone numbers with two different cell companies, because of work needs. On my other hand I have a One X. The sense interface from HTC is the best user friendly interface I have tried. No lag, awesome graphics, you can shoot real nice pictures, I love the keyboard and the best feature is the way you look for telephone numbers and names. Battery last longer than previous HTCs, I would say 1.7 times longer than the One X or Desire HD, at least 2.5 times longer than the GS3 and the iPhone.The One X+, has a clear full color HD screen great to surf the web for a while, watch videos or to play games like in a portable console (look for EA Dead Space, awesome graphics). The only think that you'll find out here is since games are high resources consumers phone's processor will make your phone feel the heat near the camera. So far these kinds of applications are the only ones making the processor heat up like that. I have made a couple of calls for nearly 60 minutes without having a heat up issue.I have seen some issues reported on the internet regarding this model. This phone come from the UK and has been unlocked to use with any carrier. I haven't had any issues regarding the no sim message. I can imagine that this could be due to some carriers OS distribution, it had happened to me with the One X that came from Vodafone Germany, unlocked also. I was experiencing some issues until the OS was updated by Vodafone.Audio quality seems great to me. I usually play non compressed music on other devices. I have Sony's Music Unlimited service which has a very nice quality audio files and you can play off line also. I have synch my phone with my car by Bluetooth to play music and answer phone calls. The car has factory built in Bluetooth to do both things, and I can tell you that music sounds better than a CD: Answering the phone from the car has a very good listening quality and I haven't had any complaints from the other side.I simply love this phone.",24,5
HTC,"So, now that that's out of the way, it probably isn't better than the One, but why did it take the HTC One to make people realize HTC makes great phones? I broke a 64gb Ipod, and for about the same price, I got a phone (and all those capabilities) AND a 64 gb mp3 player with better battery life.But that's beside the point there are a few things that are very important:1) DesignGreat feel, in many ways I find the thin poly carbonate of the One X+ better than the iphone 5. It's got a grippy feel that is nice while still feeling solid. It's also very thin. The photos kind of make it looks like the sides bow upward, and curve, but I'd say it feels/looks very flat and smooth. I like the ""infinity display"" as well as the fact that the 3 touch sensitive buttons at the bottom don't take up the display and extend the whole way to the base. I hate on the One (and a LOT of other phones) that those buttons and other parts take up so much room at the bottom, decreasing screen maximization.2) PerformanceYeah, it's a tegra 3. So what? This is the same processor that put the nexus 7 on the map for being comparable to the ipad in performance for 1/2 the price (I know I keep relating to apple products, but let's be honest that unfortunately that is the yardstick that everything else is measured by, if only for it's ubiquity). With Jelly bean and a snappy processor and even sense 4, this thing is crazy smooth. Theoretically this phone is also supposed to get the Sense 5 update, which I assume will only make it better.3) BatteryI was concerned about this going in. 2100 Mah is not anything crazy. I honestly believe that this will be the big emphasis on the next generation of phones. We've got performance down that unless you're playing the most DEMANDING games (get a console/pc!) you're phone is way more than adequate. Battery life/storage/screen real estate will be the next battles. BUT, for now? This thing works GREAT. So, why in the world would you turn power saver off? It manages what you do and don't let through as far as in the hibernate/rest mode. Xperia Z just introduced this technology this year, and HTC has had it for a while. In any case, in real world, just like the speed/performance, this thing works very well. I don't have to worry much about charging at all.4) Looks/miscellaneousI know it's superficial, and you can say I'm scraping for another point, but when they came out with the black iphone 5, everyone called it like the B-2 bomber of cell phones. Those are gizmodo's exact words. How could this description not also apply to the X+? This is a thin, matte, beautiful phone, that includes a 4.7 inch screen (for those of you that still defend iphone 5's screen size or even 4s, get outta here! Is it even debatable that 3.5 inches is too small for a great smartphone these days?). Sense 4 does a pretty good job being close (ish) to stock android. Even if it's not perfect, sense 4 has some great widgets. I'd say like APW pro +. I really do think they're very nice.5) Anticipating complaintsI know this may have come off somewhat biased. I know the phone has it's weaknesses (sealed battery and capped storage for 2). As far as the sealed battery goes, I got mine used and it's still going strong. Replacing an HTC battery is still cheaper than an Iphone (though admittedly possibly not as easy). As far as the storage? I get 59 usable gb, which I think is VERY efficient. I was surprised to have so much space. I am a huge fan of locally stored music/videos and consider myself a data hog. The only thing I can say to this is really look at how much you have stored on that 64 gb SD card + 16 stock gb on the SIII. My guess is you'd get by with this storage and be better off with a better screen, nicer feel, and more premium skin for the OS.",18,5
HTC,"In short, I love this phone. I currently own 2 of them. One for my wife, and the other for me. The first one I purchased was this one on Amazon, so I could decide if I wanted to switch from an Android device to a Windows Phone. Needless to say I was blown away. I was always a fan of the flexibility of Android, and loved adding custom software and Roms to my phone. My wife on the other hand just wanted a phone that worked consistently. Her HTC Mytouch4G was getting slow and buggy, so I decided to have her try a Windows phone since I had heard nothing but good things (We are on Cincinnati Bell, so an iPhone was not an option. Although I don't think I would have chosen that over the Radar anyway). When my wife got her Windows phone she loved the interface, and the integration with Facebook. She didn't like that MyFitness Pal app didn't have a barcode scanner (it does now), and that there is no Words with Friends (still isn't), but those were small gripes in comparison to having a phone that didn't hang and need to be rebooted daily. Speaking of daily, under typical usage neither of our Android devices would last more than 8 hours on a charge. The Windows phone will go a day and a half (still no blackberry) but much better. Well, as you may have guessed, I gave up my modded Android HTC G2 for a Radar as well, and haven't regretted it for a second. Having your hands on one of these things is believing. If you get a chance to try one out take a friend with an android or iphone with you. Go to Youtube and stream a video, and watch how much faster the Windows phone can do it. It is really amazing.Pros:Slick interfaceJust WorksGood Camera (Rear facing)Decent front cameraSolid HTC buildCons:Windows app market much smaller than Android or iPhoneUpdate 7/16/13 I Sold on my HTC Radar some months ago, and I have to say it held up really well. I still don't think you can go wrong with this phone, especially if you aren't heavily invested in another ecosystem.Additional Pros I left out originally:SkydriveThe con of the app market has been mostly mitigated with a lot of official apps released in the last year. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Linked In, ebay, Amazon etc. Still no Instagram, but check out Instance for a good substitute if you want that functionality.",10,5
HTC,I bought this phone for my daughter thinking she would really enjoy the features it provides. I read the product reviews before buying it but foolishly thought I would have a different experience. The negative reviews were correct. This phone keeps shutting off and turning back on by itself. My daughter went from excited and loving the phone to hating having to deal with the headache of it. If there is no way to fix this problem I will definitely be returning the phone and buying something else. What a disappointment!,12,1
HTC,"I do not have much time with my phone, but my friends who know more than I do about cell phones, I say it's an excellent phone. has camera and the photos are clear and beautiful. The Wi-Fi is buenisimo. Wherever I get the signal internet. The only detail I see is that I can not change the language because the window is in English and can not make changes in that regard.I am very glad to have my cell",10,5
HTC,"First thing I noticed when I opened the UPS box was that it came in a Tmobile Box. It is not the unbranded Z710E version Advertised. It has Tmobile software. I'm not sure if they opened the box to unlock the device, or if it was used, but when I got it, the seal was broken, and the box has obviously been opened. There wasn't even a plastic screen thing to peel off. It is not the Z710E version. This is a great phone but I am highly unsatisfied that it has Tmobile crap on it and the tmobile logo. I do not want to see tmobile each time i turned the phone on.I recommend to NOT buy from World Wide Distributers.",12,1
HTC,"this is the phone i wanted, and i would have gave this product 5 stars if it came like i wanted.the shipping was fast, within a week FedEx calls and tell me that a package will be at my house the next morning, and that i need to sign it.about the phone, its great, fast, cheap, and one of the first phones of this new generation phones, therefore it will last long before i will need to replace, perfect buy for someone like me that isnt intrested in a contract, still getting used to cause i used iphone for the past 4 years.the phone also came with 8 gb class 4 (kingston) memory card, which i did see in other sites but not on this page, so i bought 16 gb mc just in case, so its great.now if you are looking for an unlocked device, this is not.its T mobile's htc and it even comes in their box and has the logo under the glass,above the screen and ofcourse tmobiles rom.the phone isnt unlocked, works only for tmobile, when you insert another sim it asks you to enter a password which the seller did not provide, after a long frustrating week with many calls, i was lucky enough and got T mobile to unlock it for me, because my friend is on t mobile.if you buy this phone you probably need it unlocked cause otherwise you would have bought it with a cotract from a network, or even live in another country and bought it cause it is cheaper on amazon.the seller did not contact me back so far, all through i managed to get it unlocked, if he will answer back i might change the review, but just letting you know, this is not unlocked, and if you are not on t mobile or have a way to unlock it, its a brick, might as well use at as a door stop.",14,2
HTC,"This cell is absolutely what I expected, what I hoped for, and what I needed. Watched a lot of youtube videos on the cell so I knew what I was getting into. I love the qwerty keyboard (amazing typing experience), the touchscreen, the fact that it's an android, the HTC sense, and yes, even the size of the screen (screen size for me is perfect). Always been a 'love at a distance' blackberry fan, but I always had a love for androids. So when I came across this cell I had to have it. Definitely glad I purchased it. Went into this purchase aware of the limitations of memory and battery life, but I have a couple ways around that. So far so good -- definitely LOVE it!UPDATE: Be VERY aware about the limitations of internal memory. You won't be able to load many APPS on the cell even if you send a lot of your apps to an SD card. If you can live with it, it really is an amazing cell. If you use the calendar feature, the reminders pop up on the lock screen and I love that you can slide the button of either snooze or dismiss into the half circle. If you are looking for a simple, user-friendly cell that is primarily used for facebook, social networking, texting, taking quick photos, and email than you have a rare jem in this. If you are looking for a cell that is decked out in a multitude of apps and a big screen, probably not up your alley.Still love it! Still recommend it, but only to the right people that want a simple cell not a tablet/cell but more like cell/pda/social networking.",35,5
HTC,"This phones has a great keyboard and decent performance for relatively low specs. The HTC Status is a great texting and messaging phone; however, overall I found the screen size to be a rather limiting feature. The phone would have been much better if HTC got rid of the call and end buttons and enlarged the screen. I would have kept the phone if not for the problem described below. My three star rating is based on the phone itself, and not the problem with the sale.The point of this review is to warn people about the purchase and seller description. I purchase from Cell Lounge Inc. and the device was listed as new but it was in fact refurbished. List correctly if it's a refurb, just say so. It shipped in a refurbished box and had marks on the phone from prior use. Also, the contents where not retail packaging. Amazon needs to enforce seller descriptions. This is the second ""new"" phone I purchased that was refurbished and promptly returned to Amazon.",30,3
HTC,"First of all, I've always been a little releuctant towards writing reviews and this is my first one. Kindly apologize me incase you find something wrong in it.I've been using this phone for the past 6 months and so far the experience on a whole has been great but not perfect (nothing is perfect in the world). Firstly, there is one significant difference between the Status (a810a) and the Chacha (a810e) which is very important to people who are wanting to use this phone in Europe and Asia. The difference is in the 3G compatability of the devices, they both run on different 3G frequency bands, Status (HSDPA 850/1900 Mhz) and Chacha (HSDPA 900/2100 Mhz). This is the reason why you can't access T Mobile's 3G Network (HSDPA 900/2100 Mhz) with the Status (a810a). The same goes with Europe's and Asia's 3G Networks (HSDPA 900/2100 Mhz). So, if you are looking for a 3G compatible device to be used in Europe and Asia or to use it with T Mobile then get the Chacha (a810e). The Status (a810a) would work fine with all the other gsm networks within the US. Whereas The 2G aspect of both the devices are the same (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) meaning it would work fine in every country. The phone that is being sold here is the Status (a810a) and not the Chacha (a810e).Secondly, and most importantly the phone itself.. Its a nice little phone with a lot of pros and one major con. So, here they are;Pros:+ Great build quality (looks high end).+ Amazing Qwerty keypad (has to be one of the best, very well spaced and way better than blackberry's).+ Dual camera (even though it doesn't work with skype its a good feature to have as most of the other phones in its class don't).+ Htc Sense 2.1 (very well optimized for this particular phone).+ Touch screen (quite responsive inspite of the processor being clocked at 800 Mhz).+ Excellent call quality (haven't yet had a single call drop).Con:- Low internal memory {a much awaited software update was released a couple of months ago by att, which has solved the issue a little but not completely. Even though you can transfer the apps to the memory card (not all), a little bit of internal memory is used by the app. On an average the phone with the update can hold upto 20 apps (good enough for me but could be a problem for the app freaks out there) provided you keep clearing the cache and temp data once every 2 weeks}.Things which I thought which were neither a pro nor a con:= Facebook integration (added bonus i believe, very functional and isn't just a gimmick).= Battery life {many people have had issues with it, but what i believe is that its differs from person to person. Heavy users (3G,Wifi always switched on, Gaming for atleast an hour, High Brightness, Talktime in excess of 2 hrs, etc.) would have to charge the phone twice a day and if you are a normal user like me (using the phone little conservatively inspite of taking advantage of all the features) then the battery would last a day}.= Display (screen resolution is spot on for a display this size, nothing looks pixelated).= Camera (5MP with single led flash which suprisingly takes quite nice pictures but the same can't be said about the video quality which still isn't bad as it fares better when compared to its competition).All in all, its an amazing phone and is great value for money. Sad that it didn't sell as much as it should have because of its minor flaws. I'm glad I bought it. So, what are you waiting for? Go get yours ASAP!P.S. sorry for the lengthy review.",19,5
HTC,"I got this yesterday, so far I'm very happy with it. I just slapped the sim card and memory card from my old phone in, entered the APN information I had from my old phone for 3g access and off we went. If you already have a Gmail account with android market access on it, it will let you download any apps you've purchased, like one I can't live without called Trillian for instant messaging.Beautiful screen, decent camera with a flash that works, nice keyboard, it's a little bigger than my old phone and lighter weight wise. It's also whole lot faster with android 2.3.3 and a qualcomm snapdragon 1 processor. Like others say in other reviews, it's not a gaming phone, but for the person that likes the social scene and texting a lot, it's really sweet and for the price...it's perfect.",16,5
HTC,"I have been using this phone for about six weeks by now. Before I got the HTC Surround I used Apple's iPhone 3GS, and HTC Touch Pro. I will review not just the phone, because I think the OS is also very important when talking about HTC Surround.Dimensions and CharacteristicsI think the screen size is the same of iPhone's 3G or 4G. Talking about image quality, I can't find any differences between them, of course there might be some technical differences but I am not able to notice them with my eyes :).The phone size is very similar to the iPhone; HTC Surround is a little bigger because of the speaker, but I would say there is no size difference. The built in camera is good and you have a good flash light also which is nice to have when taking pictures in dark ambience.User InterfaceMicrosoft has done a great job redesigning the screens in WP7 with ""Metro"". You will see that the icons (which are called tiles) in the main screen are ""alive"" and are not static icons like the iPhone. The tiles gives you information about your contacts (updates from Windows Live, Facebook, My Space, Messenger), some applications are using live tiles like Weather channel, so you don't have to enter the app or contacts to see the information. I think the ""live tiles"" will be very popular in the near future, because they can give you the information you need without wasting any time opening the application unless you need more info from it. Also live tiles make the main screen more attractive... I like them.Zune vs. iTunesAfter using iTunes for several years, I just realized that if you don't have an Apple's computer, then you will have some troubles using iTunes (at least that's my experience). I have to say that I like Zune much more than I like iTunes. Zune is all about multimedia, the UI is really nice, full of watermarks which change depending of what you are viewing and that makes you enjoy using the software, the opposite feeling when I use iTunes which I consider boring and I use it because I have to in order to synchronize my iPod.TouchscreenI think HTC's touchscreen responds better than iPhone's 3GS or 4G. The screen responds incredible fast (compared to iPhone) and touch is very accurate (much better than I got in Touch Pro... I can't even compare them!)Marketplace vs. AppstoreIn Ecuador the items you can purchase from Appstore is very limited due copyright terms, but in US you will find a lot of more applications in Appstore than Marketplace, even though Microsoft is doing a great job with developers, but there is a long way to go. I would really like to have applications in Marketplace like Whatsapp, Waze, Google Maps and Skype (which has been announced to be delivered in fall this year). If you think the applications are something really important when you have to pick your phone, then I recommend that you look at Zune or Marketplace if those applications you really like are available for WP7. If the application is not in available, then you can check at developer's forums if there are any plans to develop the software.KeyboardIf you are used to type using a built-in keyboard (like Blackberry 9300 or similar), then you will have some troubles while you get used to type on the screen. iPhone's and HTC's keyboard work pretty much the same, both respond fast and the size of the letters are good enough to type without making many mistakes. You can turn on the grammar checker that help you to correct misspelled words (only English), since 99% of the time I write in Spanish I have turned off that option so I cannot tell you if it is good or not.Office HubI expected more from WP7 Office hub. The office applications are extremely basic and I still don't know how to synchronize documents from the phone to the PC, or transfer files from the PC to the Phone. Microsoft has announced that Office Hub will be much better with the next upgrade (codename Mango)ConclusionIn conclusion, I am not an expert about phones; but I have used several models and OS and I really like this phone. Of course there are things to be done before it reaches the level of Android or iOS, but Microsoft is doing a great job with Phone manufacturers like HTC.PS: Last week I got the ""NoDo"" update, and now I am able to copy/paste information.--- Update: nov 6 2011 ---Many things have changed in the OS since my original review with Mango update (WP7.5) which was delivered last month. Live tiles as expected are more useful today, now you can create groups of your contacts and pin the group to the home screen. Since you can link information from Messenger, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter of your contacts, live tiles will tell you if anyone of your contacts in the group has shared something in any of those networks and you can make any comment or share anything you want without using any app, because everything is integrated in the OS.In the Message Hub now you can send messages not only using the regular SMS, you can send messages to your contacts in Messenger and Facebook Chat. The phone will let you know if the contact you are writing to is connected to one of those two networks (or both), otherwise it will suggest sending a regular SMS.Now I have Whatsapp and soon will have Skype. Waze and Google Maps still missing but I hope sooner than later they will be available.There are many changes in the phone with the upgrade of the ""new"" OS (WP7.5) and I don't want to make this review longer than it is already, I am really happy with this phone and I don't find any reason to go back to iPhone or change to Android.",80,5
HTC,"The phone is auto restarting constantly. The battery compartment had some scratches. Is really new? I apply all updates and still the same, it restarts every time you try to do an operation.",10,1
HTC,"The phone is quick and extremely responsive. Reception is clean and clear, the video is sharp and smooth, Setup was a breeze and once I connected to my network surfing was enjoyable, web pages were quick and smooth. I would recommend the phone to all my friends. I have two problems:i. The company advertise the phone as UNLOCKED and it was not.2. The battery life with all the features turned on can be less than a day.The new windows interface takes some getting use to but it is very quick and stable. It has not crashed as yet and everything works.A great phone",26,5

HTC,"In the pictures, it shows a Htc touch pro 2 EUROPEAN phone. This means that it is not verizon, at&t, sprint, alltel, or T-mobile. it just says HTC on it, and it is chrome. They sent me a brown and gold t-mobile version with out a second camera on it. This one is awful. I was very excited to get this phone, and paid alot for it. And they sent me the wrong one.",19,1
HTC,Great phone and the shipping was much faster than expected. The seller sent extra accessories for which I am grateful. Love the product and so many apps were already loaded.Excellent buy from Amazon,14,4
HTC,"Initially I dint notice that my phone is not having second camera. Seller has mentioned model number as T7373 and when I explored on internet I found that T7373 has second camera for video calls, even the product's picture also show a second camera. But there is no second camera, this is very big feature missing. Seller should paste original picture of their product.",16,4
HTC,"I bought this product as a new one, but I received a used phone. It has scratches. Sometimes the signal fails for problems in the device.",10,3
HTC,this seller is a fraud. he sent me a phone which was at&t phone and he unlocked it and sold it to me. the phone is new but was not originally unlocked phone. the serial number on the phone and on the box was different and this is how i figured out. also the manual provided was not original and photocopied and sold in the box. doesn't have the complete info on operation. crap .dont buy the products from such people.,10,1
HTC,"HTC Vivid is such an awesome phone that I've been dreaming about having. Now i finally have it on my hand! The product is brand new in the original box, and the unlocked code is provided in the box too. When I insert the T-Mobile SIM card in it, it allows me to put the unlocked code. Then it will work perfectly. The dealer even sent me a car charger and a case, which is really nice. All in all, this is a phone you never regret using.",37,5
HTC,"The phone is real nice. Despite all the reviews in Youtube from different companies. The phone works great, its incredible fast and it is the last phone with the freedom you need to add extra memory since the new HTC models doesn't have the micro SD slot and not removable battery (or back cover).This phone comes already unlocked from the provider and you don't have to introduce an unlocking code. It comes on its original box (AT&T), it's brand new but the only issue is that phone doesn't come with earphones. It's not big issue at all, bur it would be great if HTC could include the earphones with microphone.The battery duration might be an issue, so I recommend to buy:- Anker External Battery Pack- Hyperion AT&T HTC Vivid 4G 2 x Battery + ChargerFor less than $400 USD this is an excellent choice for an android phone.",24,5
HTC,"I bought this HTC vivid phone to go with a new StraightTalk phone plan I am using. This phone is everything and more, and works perfectly with what I need! It arrived on time and in good condition, and I have no complaints about it after a month of use.",20,5
HTC,Hello 2 all d phone lovers out there I'm just gonna b short. I have bought d HTC vivid 2mths ago an what I expected of the phone I got way more than I bargained 4. Time would fail me 2 say how much this phone challenges the best of phones an wins. Just keep in mine with a gr8 phone comes poor battery but with an extended battery the phone again wins d Grammy........ Thanks HTC,19,5
HTC,"I was so excited for this phone, as mine is broken and one by one more and more problems were arising from it. My fiance had the Vivid at one point and it was amazing. We did our research, and read all reviews of all that we were looking at. IDK if the good reviews got lucky and actually got what they ordered, or if they're people who work for the company. I paid $189.00 for a refurbished phone, the volume buttons were completely worn, I got a used battery, the charging port was loose, and the plastic around it had been buffered. When I emailed the company the response was quick, and I was told if I sent the phone back they'd refund my money and compensate me an extra $10 for the shipping. When I clicked the button that said 16 new there was one to select out of them, the rest were ATT only. While I received an unlocked phone, it was not new. I strongly suggest you listen to my review and the others. We'll see how smoothly it goes for me to get my refund, which btw you should be covering the return shipment in the first place.",14,1

HTC,"Hey,I bought this cellphone to replace my old Omnia 2 (WinMo 6.5).There are a few pros that really make me happy on this cellphone:- HTC Sense:HTC interface rocks. I'm really impressed with the people app and all integration it does with your app. It amazed even some friends that has others brands such as Galaxy S2- dual core:It is not fast as a S2 but it won't let you down.- buildLooks good. Well constructed, HTC spent some money in good materials here.- ScreenIt is bright, colors seems to have the right colors (Galaxy colors looks green to me) and it is readable at sunlight (you can make a call, but it is not comfortable to read a message)What is not so good:- WeightIt is heavy: 170 grams is heavy compared to the 111 from galaxy s2 and also heavy compared to my old phone- BatteryThis really limits your cellphone. In fact this is not something related only to HTC EVO, but is something that impacts ALL smartphones. If you want it full power, it'll not last 6 hours.I definitely was going to rate this phone as 3 stars, but after talk with some friends I notice this is a common issue among smartphone users, so I spent some time testing configurations on my device to save some battery. right now. It can make 2-3 days ""saving"" battery or 1 day of hard usage.So, here is the thing.Sync: I did several tests... data transfers over 3G drains your battery.Take some time and configure it right. Do you really need to have your mail box being checked each 15 minutes? I really advice you to reduce or disable most of syncs.wifi:Check if there is wifi available, turn your Wifi on. It consumes less battery.GPS:""GPS satellites"" drains your battery a lot.disable ""GPS satellites"" unless you are going to use your HTC as a GPS navigator. Use wireless networks instead. It is enough for most of your applications and will not eat your battery.If possible think about change you network settings from WCDMA and GSM to only GSM specially if you know you'll not be using data transfers.Rgds",12,5
HTC,"I've had this phone since April 2011 and I really like it. I wanted a touch screen that wasn't a smartphone and that's exactly what the Pantech Crux is. The battery is good (I can go about 1.5-2 days without charging. In this day of smart phones that have to be charged every night/throughout the day, I view this as a good thing). It has a music player that is OK, but I don't like how you can't edit a playlist after you create it. The response time when you select something is a little slow, but everything works. The texting is frustrating sometimes because it CAN be inaccurate, but THIS IS NOT A SMARTPHONE, so what were you expecting?If you have patience and don't care about having a smartphone, this phone is good. I actually destroyed my first Pantech Crux on a treadmill and requested that it be replaced by the same phone--that's how much I like it.",27,4
HTC,"I bought a used version of this phone for my girlfriend as a replacement for a similar phone that was on it's last leg.(It was given to her used) The condition is great, no screen scratch's or imperfections anywhere to be seen. Anywho, she is in love with this phone, the dealer we bought it from was great, it was packaged rather well. Everything was secure and not flopping around in the box etc. If you want a cool touch phone experience, this is it. It's not a smart phone either, so you dont have to worry about any data plan's etc. Overall its a rather nice phone, very easy to use and setup etc. It's not too large either which is very nice now a day's considering smart phones are like huge. Lol.",12,5
HTC,"As soon as it turned on for the first time I was impressed. but then it never worked again. I took it to a tech guy from verizon he said it was a junk phone and I should never have to pay for something like this ever. So if you buy this be careful, cause you may share my experience with it. Which in the end will make you want to tear out your hair and punch someone in the face.ps this phone sucks",10,1
HTC,The seller sent me a phone (htc droid eris) that worked for only three hours before it completely shut off. I thought it was a battery issure so I went to my local verizon to see if it was an issue they can solve. They told me the phone I was sold was completely a dud and that not only did it not work there was nothing they can do about it to fix it. They demanded that I speak to the seller and get my money back. Overall it was a horrible experience and I will never purchase a phone through amazon's wirelesscirle.,62,1
HTC,"This is not a new phone. It's a refurbished phone. Its certainly not as described. The only thing new on this was the outer case. The really important parts are the insides, which appear to have been really poorly repaired by some ill-informed reseller.Here's the bottom line...I bought this for a friend, not me, so I have no way to test this on my account (I am ATT, she has Sprint). She tried it for a couple of days and it wasn't working as if it was new (tinny sounding, somewhat functioning pixels on the display, low audio quality in general).When I bought this from Amazon, I expected that it would be delivered in a couple of days on my Prime account...it took TEN days, which is just revolting. They extended my return interval to 31 Jan 2013 and that's fine if it's working. However, the phone was just returned to me for a return. Now I am out $200 because some monkey at 5 turd distribution thinks I am trying to scam them. Quite frankly, I will NEVER purchase from this vendor again, even if their price is 50% less than the next vendor. Stay away from them. No good service, no good products.",10,1
HTC,"3 Days after I got the phone it stopped charging. I went to the Sprint store for them to take a look at it and that is when I found out that the phone had been tagged ""DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR"" before I had even received the phone!!!! That was a complete waste of $250.00. I was very dissappointed and I will never order a product from this company again.",56,1
HTC,"The Evo 4G I purchased from Amazon's merchant MidStar was defective. According to my local Sprint repair store the phone had been reprogrammed before I received it, Midstar's response was ""I believe Sprint might not know how to activate the phone because we have purchased them directly from our Sprint supplier. We have also received activation instructions from them"". Really... The rep at the Sprint store was kind enough to replace the defective phone with one of their's, less than 10 minutes later I am out the door with a working phone. I guess they know how to program a phone after all. Secondly, I was also informed that the battery that was supplied with the MidStar phone was not one of theirs. Ergo, also defective as it barely fits into the phone. $40.00 dollars later, I have a phone and battery that is what I paid for. Sprint customer service to the rescue.",52,1
HTC,"My husband and I ordered two of these phones ""new"". My husband activated phone his upon delivery. The very next day the screen stopped working. Luckily, since it was a ""technical"" issue, Sprint replaced his phone for free (we have insurance). I tried to activate my phone but the battery did not work. After advising this distributer of my battery issue, they sent me TWO new batteries, no questions asked. They didnt even request that I send the bad battery back (this is strange, any legit company would request this). After receiving the new batteries and FINALLY activating my ""new"" phone, I found that the very next day, the phone would not charge. I took the phone to Sprint and they advised that the phone was completely rusted on the inside, had random parts from Japan (not Sprint) in it and that the charger had been saudered on. The phone had major water damage and has been refurbished. Since it is a water damage issue, I have to pay my $100 deductible for Sprint to replace it. Why dont I have this distributer replace it? Because I dont trust them. Horrible company!",12,1
HTC,"I posted a review a week after I got this phone, but now im retracting from that review. 2 weeks after I got the phone, the volume stopped working... Luckily, I had insurance on my previous phone so it carried over to this one. Brought it to the Sprint Dealer, and they told me the ""Loud Speaker"" was blown. Also, the associate also told me 5300 calls were made from this phone and the phone had been activated before. Great news to hear after I spent money on a ""new"" phone. The next problem came about a week later when the phone completely stopped charging. Leaving me to switch batteries with my husband so he could charge the dead one. Brought this back to the same sprint dealer, they informed me that the complete usb charging port in the phone had been damaged and there were no sodder(sp)left on it. Seriously? A month in with this crap??? Oh yeah, make sure you have insurance, they will charge you $100 to replace the phone, luckily a brand new phone from sprint is $700+ ( the only reason i did not return it)",14,1
HTC,"Very disappointed in this phone! We've already had to take it in because it won't charge, even with a new battery.",19,2
HTC,"I've had this phone for a week now and it has been treating me VERY well. It may be because this is my first smartphone so i've upgraded from an LG Dare to this phone which is A LOT better. Reviews that you may find on youtube or anywhere else go over all the awesome features but there are also little things that make this phone great. It has unique light indicators that let you know when you have a notification (text, missed call, etc.) I read reviews that made me a little iffy about wanting to buy this phone, talking about how bad the battery life is and the reaction times, but that is just a matter of adjusting your backlight and using your task manager. Ending superfluous tasks will save your battery a whole lot and dimming your backlight will also help- my phone battery lasts on average about 16 hours (that's using the music player and camera for a short time and texting all day) so unless you're not going to be able to charge your phone for more that 16 hours you shouldn't have a problem with that if you know how to preserve your battery life. The phone looks very thick but does not feel thick in your hand or pocket so that isn't a problem either. Full slide-out qwerty keyboard is probably the best feature considering you sometimes have to use the stylus when you text using the touch screen because of how compact it is. Phone is a little laggy at times and can get somewhat frustrating but that's only if you try and rush the phone- if you give it a second or two to load it will load and then will function perfectly. The page also says this is a used phone and only includes phone, battery, and charger but it really comes in the verizon box completely brand new with PHONE, CHARGER, BATTERY, EXTRA STYLUS, AND INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS/CDs. Overall, this phone is a steal for the price of $75 and you will be very happy- unless of course you're downgrading from an iPhone or something like this, but if this is going to be your first smartphone i would very much recommend this phone. One last thing.. if you order from the ""fullfillment by amazon"" retailer it will take longer to ship because it ships from the retailer to amazon HQ and then ships from there to you, so it will take longer than usual to ship but it ships UPS from amazon which has the order tracking possibility so choosing the retailer is completely up to you.",13,5
LG,"This is certainly a fast phone, with lots of Android modding potential.The price is right, and it works great on Tmobiles network.Pros:Speed - it's just fast. Everything.Stable - no crashes ( in first week)Wifi - Wifi N is great.""4g""- aka HSPA+ - I'm seeing 10,000 kbps download. Yeah, it's stupid fast.Wifi Calling works well.Sound and call quality is excellentSize - Nice and thin....Screen - nice and bright, works in daylightCons:1.Battery Life- With great speeds comes short battery life-- for the same sort of usage my Nokia Astound would last two or three times as long.2.GPS - The GPS does not seem to work well with the Stock Tmobile Gingerbread ROM, perhaps either CyanogenMod 7 or the Eaglesblood ROMS will fix that issue, or at least let me play with the settings.3. Screen is a little too bright... needs one more dimmer setting for using at night!Note: in theory the GPS and Battery settings are improved with various firmware mods. I'll report what I find here.Update 5/7/2012 -There was a firmware update, 21y, to GB 2.3.4 -- this fixes all GPS issues(same quality as iphone/Nokia Astound)!!!, improves Battery, but reduces max speeds on modem - a tradeoff which is well worth it.",21,4
LG,"Item stated before I added to cart, that item was from Wireless Experts fulfilled by Amazon. NOTE -- if you click on item today you will see different seller. Click on it a few hours later and seller will be different again. I have NO IDEA what Amazon is doing. I've seen this on other items that Amazon sells.There were previous reviews about BOTH the phone and the manual being in a language thatwas not understandable. Mine came in Spanish. Seller not honest in description of item. See below howto ENGLISH settings.So far, 2 days, I am pleased with the phone. I installed a global SIM from company called""Roam Simple"" and tested texting and making calls FROM USA; it connected to T-Mobile.Works well. I've not used it outside USA yet. Getting connection and call quality will varyin the EU based on country, city, etc. (I have used other phones in the EU.)Call quality / clarity: In US - fine. (my SIM connected to T-mobile in USA.)DUAL SIM ... nice feature ... use one in your country with cheap in country rates. Other SIM use it for yourinternational travel global SIM.Volume fine. (in some previous reviews people mentioned issues. )FM radio - works OK. (NOTE - adjust volume up and down using the center button.)Texting - no full qwerty keyboard so it is texting as it was about 6 years ago on most phones.World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch, CalculatorBattery: Mine came with an LG 950mH .. great! is still showing fully charged.Torch (Flashlight) .. nice feature. Press center button in UP direction to turn on and off.Phone is great size for traveling.No WEB / internet access with this model. I was not expecting it.Up to 250 contacts.MAKING CALLS and SIM: If you buy a country specific (Argentina) or region (EU) SIM then you may notget service when the phone is in the USA. I bought global SIM for $29. Check with your SIM provider BEFORE buying.NOT ENGLISH: Box was in English, I was hopeful manual would be. It was not - it was in Spanish.I spent about 3 hours looking for a manual. I found full ENGLISH USER GUIDE on the LG Australiaweb site. Search the LG site for A190. The model appears to be the same as the A275 that was soldto Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil) countries. (the A275 manual not English is on the LG Brazil site).ELECTRIC POWER: The power supply had a USA plug. I cannot tell if it is DUAL VOLTAGE phone chargerallowing it to be plugged into non USA 220V power outlets with just a conversion plug. I will be using aPOWER CONVERTER (search Amazon for 220V to 120V converters). You may need a converter thanactually is a transformer - converting power down to 120v.COVERSome people talked about cover problems. Gently press down on back cover and gently slide down SLIGHTLY - about an1/8 of an inch. Then from the back, where cover should be extended past end of the phone, lift up the cover.INSTALL BATTERY. If you ever did this on any phone, this should be simple. (NOTE - SIM slots are under the battery.)COVER - back on: DO NOT SLIDE COVER UP. Start with placing cover back on to position whereyou popped it up. THEN slide it up the 1/8 of an inch to lock it in place.CHARGE THE BATTERYThe power input for the cord is under a rubber cover on the LEFT side. It only OPENS on way. BE CAREFUL.Turn phone on its side. With the power cover appearing to your left, gently pry up the rubber cover lifting itat the right edge (the right edge is slightly larger than the left edge of the rubber cover). Lift it about 1/16 ofan inch and then swing it up / out.If you get USA power plug, plug into phone and into USA outlet and charge the battery.CHANGE THE LANGUAGE: My phone's language was set to Portuguese. To get to English:1. hold down the end-call button (which is also the on/off button) on the phone to power it up.2. press upper left button - Menu3. reply ""Si"" (yes) using the upper right button.4. Enter 9 (settings) Ajustes Configuracion & Herramientas5. Enter 3 (Language) Idioma6. Enter 2 (English) Ingles",192,4
LG,"Quad-band, dual-sim GSM phone. For the price, this thing is great. It makes calls, it sends texts, and the one I've got even has a pretty decent flashlight. Yeah, it's a phone for developing markets, and it's no smartphone. But it works, and it's got good battery life.",67,5
LG,"I like the dual sim feature of the phone. I use a T-Mobile sim card and an international sim card. It is nice to be able to switch between the two sim cards without having to take the sim cards out of the phone - very convenient. The phone is easy to use. The world clock works well when switching between time zones. The only problem I have had is with an SMS message. I wrote a short message and saved to DRAFT. I later recalled it, added to it, and edited the original saved part. When the message was sent, only a very short portion of the message was sent-don't know why. I had previously sent SMS messages and they worked perfectly. Overall, I like the phone and would recommend it.",60,4
LG,"I needed a simple backup phone in case I break my Nexus 4 or it gets discharged, preferably a dual-SIM one because I did not want to remove a battery and a SIM card every time I want to use a different SIM card (I planned on using different full-size SIM cards for different purposes). Unfortunately, Nokia Basha 206 is not available on North American market (they only sell smartphones here), so I decided to buy this one because I considered LG a reputable brand. It turned out I was wrong.Pros:1. Long battery life when there is no talk (probably because the screen is always off when the phone is not used)2. Lightweight3. Has a flashlightCons:1. No hardware volume control (and it looks like you can only set the ring volume via the UI)2. The screen and letters on the screen are too small. A twice as big screen could fit in the space unoccupied by the keyboard (or with the same screen size a bigger and more convenient keyboard would fit in)3. Back cover is difficult to open4. Keys are very small5. There is no support for Cyrillic letters. All my old Nokia phones, although they did not allow to type Cyrillic letters, were able to display them. This phone supports only a few latin-based languages and displays squares for Cyrillic letters6. Navigation and control keys are not lit (only number keys are lit). Together with their extremely low profile the phone is very difficult to control in darkness.7. User menu is inconvenient and confusing. Instead navigating the menu I often turn on the flashlight. And instead of turning off the flashlight I often accidentally activate some menu commands.8. Two SIM cards cannot be used simultaneously. You need to activate either one or another.9. FM Radio is bad and noisy. I was able to tune only to 3 stations here in Los Angeles.10. It is impossible to lock the keyboard by pressing a combination of keys. It locks automatically (you can specify the time-out in settings).11. Since the screen turns off automatically after a certain timeout (10, 20, etc. sec.) it is impossible to see time and date and whether there were missed calls.12. It is impossible to change or remove the only wallpaper displaying an ugly flower.Voice quality is average. I can't say it's a pro or con, it's a fact.Overall this is a primitive, inconvenient and basic phone. I would not want to pay more than $10 for it. It cost me $22 (it was $32 on Amazon and I got a $10 discount for applying for Amazon card). Not recommended.",40,2
LG,"I traveled to Europe and used this phone with the telestial passport international sim card. It worked great as a basic cell phone. As others have mentioned, you can't change the wallpaper and there are no exterior buttons to control the volume, but for about $30, a good deal. I didn't use the dual sim card feature, but this could be very useful.",39,5
LG,"The phone is more sensitive signal-wise than my previous LG phone. This is good. The ""anticipatory"" feature in creating text messages can be annoying. Battery life is quite good. Key ""click"" is too loud to respond to texts during meetings.",11,3
LG,"The phone took LycaMobile SIM card and works great in NYCity. The charger port is mini USB, compatible with all my other family's phones which is very convenient. Wallpaper can not be changed by I like the flower. Ring volume can be changed only through UI, but I can easily toggle between Sound and Silent modes. Simple and efficient for inexpensive calling.",13,5
LG,"Light and practical. Thanks to the quadband device, the LG-A275 works perfectly well everywhere.In spite of its small size, this phone is effectively dual-sim, which represents a bonus as it helpsto have two phones in just one. For sure, the LG-A275 is a great achievement.",16,5
LG,"Got this phone to replace my old LG VX-9800 (the old OLD version of this phone). Took it to Verizon and they transferred my address book and phone number from my old phone to this one. Works great with no problems. Turns out this phone ALREADY HAS DRIVERS embedded in its built-in flash drive for Windows XP and Window 7 so you will not need to download anything from LG. Also, that it's operating system is compatible with Windows and you can access the memory card in it to add your own ringtones, alarm sounds and music to this phone. Now I just need to get used to a touch screen.For those who need the Outlook sync software, download it from LG for this phone. The secret to this is that LG does not name the software properly on download, so add "".msi"" after the name and it will install the software.In a nutshell I am pleased with this phone.",19,5
LG,"Although I was impressed with the rapid receipt of this phone, I am THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED and feel that the information regarding this item was incomplete and misleading. When I tried activating this VERIZON phone through Verizon, I was told that it is a pre-paid ONLY phone and that it must be activated as a pre-paid phone for 6 months before it can be assigned to a post-paid number. This seems like a ridiculous thing to me, but apparently there is no way around it. This information SHOULD have been stated clearly and succinctly in the product specifications, specifically in the main title description for this item. The phone itself is in the advertised, stated physical condition and I have been happy with the follow-on model of this phone, so I'm sure I would have been happy with this particular one had I been able to actually use it.",219,1
LG,"I did not see nor understand that this phone was a pay phone and after opening it and trying to activate it, Verizon told me that it was usable only as a pay phone. I emailed the seller and was told that they were not willing to take back the phone because the package was open. Please be wary of doing business with small businesses or individuals that cannot make things right for their customers. The phone is worthless to me and certainly not the bargain I expected.",118,1
LG,"The LG Cosmos VN250 is a handy little cell phone. Love the flip keyboard feature, great for texting. This is a good picture, text, and voice phone, low tech and easy to use. Pretty durable too, it can withstand the everyday use and occasional drops. With Verizon service it receives great reception and is reliable.This is my second phone of this model. The first I recently dropped in gallon of paint, which I quickly took out and rinsed off with water. (Didn't know about the bowl of rice absorption trick then). I took the phone apart, cleaned off all the paint and amazingly the only part that was broken was the microphone. After paint and water I was still able to text, take pictures, call outbound and receive calls inbound with ability to hear the caller on the other end. However, with a broken mic, they could not hear me. Impressive.",46,5
LG,I ordered this phone after doing a search on LG Cosmos unlocked and no contract. When I tried activating this VERIZON phone through Verizon I was told that it is a pre-paid only phone. I purchased this as a replacement phone for my daughter's Verizon phone that was stolen and intended to activate it on her account. Information about it being a prepaid phone was not provided in the description and product information. The phone is in good condition as stated. I'm very disappointed that I now have to return it and figure out an alternative,37,1
LG,"This is a pretty good phone. I enjoy it the only downside is its an LG. The RAM on this phone is around 10MB so if you have a full inbox your phone can run very slow and delayed. Another downside is the lack of video, flash camera, and music player. The main thing i tend to not enjoy is, this phone will randomly turn off. I will glance at my phone and i get a black screen. I push a button and then i get the power up screen. This can be frustrating at times. Other than the random shutting off and lack of RAM, i would recommend this phone",20,2
LG,"We wanted to add one of our children to our Verizon phone plan without having to commit to a contract.

Within a month (a couple of weeks ago) she complained she couldn't charge the phone. I checked and sure enough it couldn't charge because the Charging port had detached and caved inside of the phone. I contacted the seller for a return and exchange but they never responded. Fortunately Amazon has a good claim service, i'now just waiting for a follow up...",78,1
LG,The add said NEW and what i recieved was very far from new the screen was scratched and the back of the phone was very warn out and faded.

And if you do sell used phones you should atleast factory reset the phone and clear out other peoples personal information.,10,2

LG,"When the phone arrived not only had i been sent the wrong battery, but also the wrong cover plate as well. Now i only have bits and pieces to various phones...To be fair, i've owned an LG VU in the past, and when in working condition i really love this phone.

LG,"For the past few weeks the phone was giving me problems when making & receiving calls: The screen would immediately turn black and lock during calls with no possibility to bring up the keypad for voicemail options. Even the power button would not end the call unless I held it down for an extended amount of time. I con tacted Amazon about this issue and they gave me two options for a solution; send it back for full refund or contact LG for troubleshooting. I didn't want to send it back because I loved the phone otherwise. So, I corresponded back and forth with an LG rep. for a few days and tried a few different options suggested by him, to no avail. I requested for a technician to contact me and he found that they could not help me with this model and discovered that the warranty for this phone was covered by LG Panama. He sent me all the contact info. for them and I opted to contact by Live Chat. The rep. went out of his way to help me by translating his Spanish text to English so that I could understand. Turns out, this phone has sensitive sensors at top left hand side of screen that senses when you put your ear to phone and will blacken until you remove from your ear...which is a great feature, by the way. My sensor was covered by a tempered glass screen protector and immediately after removing it the phone did it's job perfectly! Needless to say I was so happy to know that I had not purchased a defective phone. This is an amazing phone so far, processor is fast and it has some great features. I love how it looks, the gold color is very classy. Also, the built-in stylus is cool and I use it extensively as it helps keep down the smudges and helps me type more smoothly. You won't go wrong with this purchase at a greatly discounted price. I get many compliments on this phone and many find it hard to believe I paid under $200.",102,5
LG,"Best of both worlds. Its a name brand phone but as unlocked international version so the price is right. Received the phone and put my AT&T go phone sim in and it started right up. I went to the APN settings and set them the same as my last phone and bingo data was up. (If you dont have your old phone just google the APN settings for your carrier) It has loaded all my apps and games no problem. I actually have used the stylus a bit and it is OK. I turned on the swipe to type feature for texting and I finally can type halfway decent on my phone. Not a ton of bloatware on here but some apps are preloaded. I do love the built in flashlight app since I have heard bad things about spyware in some of the popular downloadable ones. Great reception, works with the Bluetooth in both vehicles and my earpiece Bluetooth. Good wireless range. Lighter than my daughters off brand 5.5 inch phone. The battery lasts from 1.5 to 2 days based on how much game time I get in. I watch a lot of you-tube HD on it and it looks great. So Far I Love it!",98,5
LG,Love this phone a must buy.... I had a Samsung galaxy s4 this LG G3 is so much better I love it,38,5
LG,"I absolutely love this phone, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice smart phone at a economical price. I had a galaxy s4 before this one. The only thing I don't really like is that if you don't have two sim cards it will show you ""no service"" on the home screen when infact you do have service. I have T-Mobile and the service coverage is the same and It seems to be just as fast.This phone is a must buy. Good luck :)",11,5
LG,AMAZING. Everything is just perfect. My only issue is that the front camera isn't much. It has the quality of a Iphone 4 front camera. The back camera is amazing true HD. I love it,11,5
LG,"I bought this LG G3 Stylus for my SO. I specifically chose the G3 Stylus option for him because he has manly hands/fingers (obviously). Sometimes he gets what I call the ""fatfingeritis"" where he goes to type something and ends up hitting a million keys at once. The stylus is perfect for someone like him. It is very sleek and tucks away into it's built-in hole, very well. He doesn't feel awkward holding it and feels it has a good circumference for him to handle.The phone itself is beautifully crafted. LG did a great job design-wise. The volume up and down buttons on the back allow for excellent ease of use. We like that they're separated by the power button as well. The buttons can be customized to operate other functions of the phone, such as the camera. If you do not wish to have that option, it is easily able to be switched off. I personally loved that when the camera is up, I can simply push the volume down button to take a selfie, for instance. There isn't that awkward messing around trying to get situate your thumb to push the button while attempting to get the right angle. Ladies, you know what I'm saying, right?! Not that my SO really cares about that option! HahaAnother thing my SO really liked was the slight curve of the phone. He felt really comfortable carrying the phone around without a case because he felt it fit perfectly with how his hand naturally holds the phone. With his job, however, we did buy him a case/holster combo. That review is posted as well. It is an amazing case!The specs on this phone are pretty awesome as well.The screen is 5.5 inches, which is pretty decent size in this day in age. My SO likes the larger screen because it makes for easier reading and less squinting. The rear camera is a nice 13MP. It is not the highest of phones out there but is decent for what he uses it for. This is a 3G capable phone and has an OS of 4.4.2 preinstalled out of the box. To determine the OS update, you can go through your service provider.",29,5
LG,So far so good with this phone. I like it better than Samsung.,22,5
LG,Good phone though 8gbs is limiting in space,14,3
LG,"Most of the retailers on this site are selling used phones advertised as new. I personally have done business with one retailer, Cellphones-4u. The phone arrived in a Verizon box, unsealed, loosely floating in a plastic tray, not an LG box as it should have been. You could tell the wall charger was extremely used and subsequently, didn't work. Immediate RED flag. Called Verizon, gave them the MEID# that is located inside the battery compartment. The lady told me that the phone had been used on the separate accounts. So it spent most of it's life in shipment. Cellphones-4u keeps insisting that it is new from Verizon. He posted it under my bad review on their site. So, he is calling me and Verizon liars. In hindsight, I noticed that every bad review that was posted for Cellphones-4u, he had a reply that they were in essence, thieves or liars. Do your homework. When you receive your phone, call your service provider, give them the MEID# and find out if it is indeed a new phone. They are charging new price, make them provide what they advertise.",177,1
LG,"I looked at reviews and videos of this phone compared to other phones before I ordered this one. I really loved how the EnV 3 and Octane has the QWERTY keyboard but I wanted an updated look with the touch screen. Phone shipped quick without any issues. The activation of the phone was fine and Verizon did not ask for a data plan. There were two issues I have with the phone: 1.) I ordered this phone as ""new"" but when I started customizing it, there was already another person's ringtones, recent calls, name card and contacts on the phone. I guess that means it was briefly used by another person. I didn't like having to fix that. 2.) I had to calibrate it a few times to get the touch to be accurate. This is not a sensitive touch screen like you would find in an iPhone or an Android, this is simply an LG. It's more like you have to ""press"" the buttons than touch. Even after a few calibrations, it is still not accurate, but it functions.What I love about this phone is that there are four different ways you can text. So, if you're a text savvy person, this is great. You get the t9 on portrait, a QWERTY when you flip the phone, the qwerty keyboard when you open the phone, and on the touch screen there is a ""pen"" selection here you can draw the letters and numbers to text. I would love that feature IF the touch screen was more accurate.Overall, the phone works great and is a good compromise between modern and dinosaur.UPDATE September 14, 2014: I am furious with the touch screen. You cannot use the pen texting option easy. Dialing numbers on the front touch are annoying. I am usually just using the inside of the phone. After a while the phone starts to turn off on its own and sometimes freezes.Currently looking for a new phone. Do not go with LG touch screens!",12,4
LG,"I've had my Env Touch for over a yr. A lot of people complain about the screen coming unlocked when u put it in your pocket. I've never had a problem with it pocket dialing people. If you simply hit the side lock button twice, the screen goes black and it can't do anything while in your pocket! I just purchased my second phone today because out of my negligence, I broke the first one. The picture quality is great, it's light weight, simple and not too confusing. It could be a lil louder but who needs the whole world to know u got a text or call? The only time I've had a problem with this phone was when it needed a system update and it would shut off whenever i got online. It was a simple trip to the verizon store and a free update, problem solved! i'd recommend this phone to anyone",21,4
LG,"I received absolutely horrendous service from OEM Shop in Brooklyn, NY; a seller on the Amazoncom website. For several days, I left phone messages and sent emails to this seller. Finally I received an email back with an RMA# to return my item. I originally purchased the EnV2 LG cellphone that was described as refurbished MINT Condition. When I received the phone and contacted Verizon Wireless to activate the unit, the MEIN had been previously assigned to another account since 2009...and it was associated with a Samsung Reality. I called Verizon's technical support dept; then I stopped in at a Verizon location. No one could help me since the phone was already assigned to someone else. I then emailed OEM Shop again and requested a call back from a manager. Still to this day (2 weeks later), no one from OEM shop has called me back. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!",57,1
LG,I ORDERED 3 OF THE LG enV2 VX-9100. two out of the 3 have problems. One was bought as a future spare phone. To be used at a later date. After setting up 2 phones to use I found One would not shift when I texted people. So I switched That new phone's information to the spare phone I purchased. So I am outone phone already. The second phone that I had originally set up I found that it will not go to contact names that I try and get to. I have to scroll down to get to what ever name I need to call or text. Now that I am over my 30 day sellers warrenty I can't send them back. Ship date on the mailing envelope is 1/26/2011. Phones were ordered on 12/31/2010. At this point with very little time to set up and try out before warrenty was up. I am not happy with 2 out of three phones not working. These phones were also set up at a Verizon store.,31,1
LG,"I took this phone to a Verizon store, and they couldn't transfer my service to it because it was originally an Alltell phone. This makes no sense because Verizon bought Alltell, so it's probably a Verizon problem, not a phone problem. Even so, be careful ordering this phone. It may not work. Thank God for free returns.",18,1
LG,Arrived on schedule. Great phone for non-smart phone users.,11,5
LG,"The phone itself looked new and had OEM screen protector applied. There was no user manual. I put in the battery and it had a full charge. I went to Verizon and had the phone activated with no trouble. Since the battery was getting low, I hooked up the charger with the USB cable to a port attached to my PC overnight. When I got up in the morning it was the same level of charge when I left it, although it said it was charging. Thought that might have something to do with my port, so I hooked up the wall charger and plugged that in. There was no indication it was charging. Changed to another outlet and wiggled the cords but nothing worked. Since this phone was for my mother who lives 2 hours away and I was taking it to her that morning, I went to the Verizon store and paid full retail to get a phone that I knew would work. I noticed the wall charger in their package had LG embossed on it and there was instructions. The charger I received did not say LG. I hooked up the LG wall charger to the Amazon purchased phone and USB cable and it started charging properly. Clearly an incorrect charger.",21,1
LG,"This gives me a phone I can use, without everyone trying to track me, locate me, or sell me stuff. The music player has very good sound. The body is very slick, so you probably want to get one of the ""rubberized"" cases.",13,5
LG,Love the size of the phone and the slide out key board. You just need to be careful not to put pressure on the sides of the phone because you will activate something you don't want to. Had problems with the battery though.,13,3
LG,"after delivery, I tried to activate the phone and entered the id on the verizon website. I was informed that this phone was reported lost or stolen.",15,1
LG,"Ordered for a friend of mine who didn't want to use a plan with data charges, all he wanted was talk and text. He's very pleased with the phone, especially the slider keyboard.",16,5
LG,"For what it is, it's great. Moved kid from a flip phone to this and he is happy. Works as expected.",16,5
LG,"I just bought this phone for my mom, who just needs one to make and receive calls. We are impressed with the phone's look - right size, beautiful red color, and bigger than usual buttons. This phone is excellent for the senior.",11,5
LG,"I bought the device from this company week and a half ago. The device i receive looked new and beautiful. The problem began when I tried to connect to the Internet through different carriers. At first, I didn't realize there was a problem. I was just sure the problem is the carrier. So during the week and a half I went through 4 different carriers, I had to pay $200 for accounts activation, and all the carriers told me the same thing - THE PHONE IS DEFECTIVE.I bought it a week and a half ago from the company above and during this time they've managed to change the company name (from HeavyDuty Electronics TO Mobile Front) and to lower the price, for the reason that all the devices are damaged.(I bought my device at $ 673.99 ).Imagine that - I bought my self a new smartphone, paid full price, and can't connect to the internet!When i complained to the company that the phone don't work i got an Email from them saying because i bought it for use in the USA, there's might be problems with 4G LTE.The problem is they didn't tell you that when you buy, and the problem is not only with 4G LTE - YOU HAVE NO INTERNET AT ALL!!!So if you want to save yourselfes time and money don't buy from this company!!",31,1
LG,"This Phone was really a bad experience for me. I have always ordered cellphones online, but never experience anything like this b4. After receiving the phne I noticed that it had an international plug on it. contacted Amazon they couldn't help, they contacted Lg, a waste of time. I was told that this phe was an international Phne and it was nothing that they could. Text messages were going somewhere but I didn't know where. I had to continue to go back and forth with turning the mobile data on and off when trying to send pic text msgs. Go sms Pro app doesn't work at all. The phne incoming/outgoing calls worked pretty well. (1) star. Pics were ok, could have been clearer. can't load apps to Sd card, can't retrieve info from SD card.The Phe looks really sharp that's why I'm giving it a star. I sent it back, 2 many issues for a new phne.",10,2
LG,"Very happy with my new phone. It has benn working very well from 2 months now!Great screen resolution, very good and long battery life, rigth weight, very good finish and desing.Works perfect with Digitel in Venezuela.",10,5
LG,Bought 2 phones. One was very good condition and one just good condition. They came extremely fast and both in perfect condition.. Seriously they don't even look used! Both phones are working amazingly so far!! 5 stars!,10,5
LG,"Absolutely love this phone. I never was one to use a stylus because its not really convenient, but with this one being built in i find i cant do without it. My fingers are quite bulky which makes typing a pain but this phone eliminates that problem.",15,5
LG,"SD card slot is not working. There is something stuck in the memory slot or it is missing a bracket or 2 that holds the memory card in place. I took my refurbished LG g Vista to a at&t store and shelled out $35.00 for another memory card, just in case something was wrong with my card. The store manager tried to get the sd card in it's slot after I had tried too but she had no luck either and said that it looks like a couple brackets are missing or possibly that something is jammed in the slot holder. I ended up buying a sd card for nothing. I contacted the company about this problem but have had no luck in getting a response. I just received my phone Saturday the 21st of June and didn't bother to put my Sims card or sd card in yet because I wanted to move everything over from my s4 to my New phone. Then Sunday I tried to put both cards in the slots and my memory card wouldn't go in, so that is when I took it to AT&T.This is my first time ordering from Amazon and if it isn't corrected, I will not be using this site again! I spent $230 on this phone and 3 other items. I also will be speaking to the better bureau agency and anyone else that I can get to help me figure out what to do on this matter!",10,1
LG,good phone i would really recommend it i only really had two things i didn't like about the phone aside from the random reboot.1.the mms didn't work out of the box i had to mess around with different apn setting i found on the internet to get it to work.2.the material the phone is made out of is very slippery and i found myself wishing i had bought a case with the phone.aside from those two things it really is a good phone.for more info please feel free to check out my unboxing and my review video at the links below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDONi3GsTk&index=15&list=PLKlQ11dfNK8TFUXY0BT1_hcbATGNrrrtmhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqPDZ9_E5Hw&index=22&list=PLKlQ11dfNK8RZVvTsc8FMw5C7vGEUgjcn,33,4
LG,All I can say is I'm pleased with this purchase. The shipping was alright too. I knew this was a great phone already. And the best part is that the internet just came on in by itself I didn't have to bother the APR or nothing. Data just flows. Overall just wonderful. Thank you,12,5
LG,This phone is WAS NOT unlocked and it's A STOLEN PHONE. I was expecting to recive an unlocked at&t phone and got a stolen Verizon wireless phone instead. Highly disappointed and outraged.,14,1
LG,I got my g Vista today... I popped in my Straight Talk At&T SIM card and I was good to go! This is an excellent budget phone that feels like a high end model.... Easy to use and nice big screen for the money!,14,5
LG,"This is a fantastic phone. Good value for the price, works fantastic in every way, and the best thing is that it is not insanely expensive. If you spend two or three times as much, or more, you get very little in return for the difference in price. For those that are wondering, this is plug-and-play for Cricket customers. I took the SIM card from my low buck Nokia 635, stuck it in the SIM slot, and BAM... everything worked flawlessly. Only thing I lost in the process was old text messages.A couple of side notes to bear in mind as you are shopping. Get a good case and a tempered glass screen protector. I like the case I bought for it too. Should provide good protection, but not too bulky and without the sticky rubber than turns your pockets inside-out. The tempered glass covers are much better than the cheap plastic film that your fingers stick to and are prone to bubbles. Below are links to the accessories I purchased... very happy with those also.Evocel??

LG,"Like the screen size of this phone, it was a purchase for my husband and really he wanted another much more expensive brand but his main feature he was looking for was a big screen... bigger the better so when I saw this phone for the price, and read some of the reviews it seemed like a promising buy. Happy to report we aren't disappointed. there are a few quirks here and there it freezes when he goes into his medal booth at work and he has to restart it all the time... very strange bug that I am sure is totally random and isolated to just his situation. but if that is his only complaint then we are doing good! The picture on the phone is great, android- love that! the sound is pretty decent, the ear piece is a little odd to get used to but maybe I'm not used to such a large phone, its hard to talk and listen at the same time HAHA. but I still would rather buy this for my husband who will probably smash it within the next 6 months and need a new one anyways... rather than spend the money $500+ ... it really is a good deal and a great phone.",17,4
LG,"I have used a lot of phones and to me the Note 4 is the best phone out today but the G2 is the best VALUE out today bar none. I'm kind of of a tech geek. Not all tech but certainly when it comes to phones. Here's the bottom line. For the price you will not find a better phone. This phone has a full HD Display, 440 ppi, great battery and a snapdragon 800 for $240 ??!! Phones will lesser specs like the HTC one M7 sell for $100 dollars more. Even phones with similar specs like the S4 are also $100 more.This phone has a great display. Txt is very sharp and is easy to read. The color contrast isnt great though. In other words colors could be richer but it's certainly not a deal breaker. This phone is also blazing fast. If you do a lot of web browsing on your phone then you will love this. The snapdragon 800 isnt the newest and badest chipset out but it still a beast. Loading sites and clicking on articles is blazing fast. The phone feels very light. Also the bezels or ""frame"" of the phone is very skinny too. In other words the phone is mostly screen unlike phones like the htc one series which has such big bezels it's a turnoff for me. The phone feels sleek and isnt slippery although I would def reccommend a case because I cant imagine a phone with these specs for $230 is very durable. In other words this phone cant be perfect or it'd be too good to be true. I wondered why a phone with these specs could be so cheap, well it's probably the build quality. Not saying I have issues now, but I doubt this phone will last years like an Apple or Samsung. What else...camera is decent. Not the best photos but it's fast at least. Speakers are loud but dont compare to the htc boomsound speakers but neither does any other phone. Battery is very good so far. The buttons on the back setup is not bad at all. The idea of the volume and on/off buttons being on the back really turned me off initially but I kind of like it. You dont have to worry about accidentally hitting them.So if you're on a budget and want a sharp display and blazing fast processor I'd highly reccommend this phone. If you're not on a budget I'd go with the Note 4.",57,5
LG,"This is the best purchase I have made in my life. I have had many phones and various phone companies but honestly this is the best phone I've had and the best company I could use with this phone. Although I bought it used, I received it as if it were new. The seller paid for shipping and in addition add my buy a car charger, one for power and headset. This phone is unlocked. I bought a kit activation Straight Talk at Walmart and activate it with Straight Talk but for use with AT & T antennas. It is super fast, much more than my WIFI. And it connects to the Internet where my TM another company (you know what, I never had signal Lol). I love my phone and my new Straight Talk phone company. 100% recommended",18,5
LG,"I bought this phone for $207, that's right $207! This is replacing an Iphone 6 (16gb) that cost me $700 including tax without a contract, yes that's right $700! This phone has 32gb of storage (double that of the Iphone 6) I'm not here to start an article on Android vs Iphone. What I will say is this. This LG G2 from 2013 is sexier, has a better feel, better screen, better Camera (when comparing photos side by side) and to me better software that is noticeably faster and more responsive than IOS on Iphone, not to mention amazing battery life. All around it is a better phone that feels more premium in every aspect that I cannot come to grips with justifying the price of my iphone 6. The customizable widgets, the fact that you can upgrade this to Android 5.0.2 Lollipop, it's a win in every situation.I love my macbook and will perhaps never make that switch, but I have grown absolutely tired of the same tired IOS design and limited capabilities in a trapped apple eco-sytem with no customizable options and not to mention a dedicated back button. I don't mind paying premium for premium products but at just over $200 the LG G2 to me is much more premium on every single level than my Iphone 6 which I just sold for get this $540 used, insanity! I have no doubt that if this LG G2 had IOS and an Apple Logo it would be Apple's biggest hit in it's history, that's how awesome this design is. With Apple, you are simply paying for Software and Eco-System, that is what has people hooked.",17,5
LG,"This is my review for the unlocked LG G2 D800, purchased from the seller known as BREED, and fulfilled by Amazon.I chose this particular phone for 2 reasons:1. It supports all LTE bands currently used by AT&T; in particular, band 17 (700 MHz). This is important, because AT&T uses band 17 as its mainline LTE band in the United States. The other LTE bands (2, 4 & 5) are only used in areas that AT&T either cannot get band 17 licenses, or as band 17 overflows.2. It supports full device encryption. While Android has been supporting device encryption since 3.x, not all manufacturers have been enabling it in their devices.The phone arrived in a slightly shelf worn AT&T box, with no shrink wrapping. So it was difficult to determine if that is simply how the devices come, or if the phone was first opened and unlocked by the seller. Everything else inside the package was in pristine condition. Apart from the lack of shrink wrapping, there were no other visible signs of messing with the box contents. The phone even had an unprovisioned AT&T micro SIM installed.I then began the process of setting up the phone for use on the Straight Talk, AT&T BYOD plan. Although you can easily provision the phone yourself using the ST website or via the automated voice call in system; I strongly recommend calling the ST ""Executive Resolution"" number and having a live person do the provisioning for you. This advice especially applies if you are porting from one SIM card to another.Once the ST micro SIM was installed and provisioned, I had voice & SMS going. I then used the Straight Talk APN app to set the correct APN values, and everything worked the first time. You know that you got the APN settings right if you can browse the web and send/receive MMS messages to/from yourself. Unlike the old GSM (non LTE) phone I previously was using; I was pleased to discover that I can send/receive MMS messages without first turning off the WiFi and using carrier data only.When using the phone, I discovered that the microphone is very sensitive. Directing your voice towards the microphone causes an ""echoing effect"" on the other party's end. The best way to speak is to hold the phone so that your voice projects in a direction that is parallel to the display surface. And when using the speaker phone, do not try speaking closer than 8 inches from the microphone.The phone I received had AT&T bloatware installed; which leads me to believe the phone was unlocked by the seller. Because the AT&T apps were specific to AT&T customers; I simply disabled these apps. You will also end up disabling the ""Voice Mate"" app, because it gets KO'd by the latest version of ""Google Now"" that gets downloaded by Google Play.Because the phone was originally locked to the carrier; the ""Tethering Entitlement"" setting was still disabled; and I was unable to turn on the tethering function. But to change the Tethering Entitlement setting, you need a rooted phone; so the you can edit the settings database. My phone was manufactured in August 2014, and as such, all previously known rooting methods seem to be invalid; as of the time of this review. The Tethering Entitlement setting even blocks PDAnet.The IR blaster is an extra bonus feature. I fondly remember using the IR blaster on my old Sony Cli?? to hijack the TVs in bars and waiting rooms; and I can't wait to see what mischief I can cause now.Except for the tethering issue, I really like the phone. I hope to try out the NFC soon, and will update this review as needed.********** UPDATE 2015-01-20 **********Using a Straight Talk SIM effectively bricks the stock NFC functionality for anything other than data transfers; because the ST SIM lacks the ""secure element"" required by the Smart Card Alliance for processing of financial transactions over NFC. That means that unless you are using a ""secure element SIM,"" like the unprovisioned one that came with the phone, you cannot use the ISIS Wallet app, so you might as well disable that one as well.You can however, use NFC with Google Wallet; which relies on the ""soft"" secure element offered by the Host Card Emulation (HCE) that is built into KitKat. There is no way to make ISIS Wallet work with HCE because ISIS Wallet is backed by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon; who want to push the use of secure element SIM cards.Note: Once you disable ISIS Wallet, you will be unable to turn on the NFC radio, unless you install Google Wallet or some other payment app that uses HCE in place of the secure element SIM.********** UPDATE 2015-01-21 **********Earlier I mentioned that I got the phone because it supported full device encryption, but that unfortunately it comes with the Tethering Entitlement setting disabled. In order to change the setting, you must root the phone. It seems though, that rooting is not compatible with full device encryption. You can have a rooted phone that allows tethering, or an encrypted phone, but not both. Tough choice, screwing AT&T or the FBI & NSA. I choose to screw the FBI & NSA 8)I also discovered that much of the echoing on the other end of my calls was being caused by an interaction between the noise cancellation microphones and the case I was using. Removing the phone from the case resolved the issue. So far, all 3rd party cases I've tried interfere with the noise cancellation mics. I may end up getting the ""official"" G2 case.********** UPDATE 2015-01-22 **********""Guest Mode"" does not work, when the phone is encrypted; because Guest Mode only uses a pattern lock, while the encrypted phone mode requires a password.********** UPDATE 2015-01-24 **********I purchased an ""official"" LG G2 QuickWindow case off Amazon. That solved the echoing problem. The reason is because the back of the case is shaped, so that it closely conforms to the phone's original contour; and therefore doesn't interfere with the acoustics of the noise cancellation microphones. Considering the case used to be over $50, and that it can be had for under $7 now, it is well worth it.http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WVDHO2XGNEB********** UPDATE 2015-02-01 **********During normal use, the battery drains at a rate of 2% to 5% per hour. If you have a continuously paired Bluetooth device, like a watch; expect 8% per hour. The phone comes with a 1.8 Ampere charger. From a 50% level, I timed the charging rates for both a 1 Ampere and a 2 Ampere charger. For the 1 Ampere charger, the phone essentially trickle charged at the rate of 3.6 minutes for every 1% needed. For the 2 Ampere charger, the phone fast charged at the rate of 1.2 minutes for every 1% needed.One thing that bothers me though is the dramatic rise in battery temperature that occurs when the screen is active for long periods of time. If you spend 30 minutes continuously browsing the web, don't be surprised to see a sharp 20 degree (Fahrenheit) rise in the battery temperature.********** UPDATE 2015-03-01 **********The charging times I previously gave were for the Bluetooth radio turned off. When the Bluetooth radio is turned on and there is an active pairing (i.e. a smart watch), the ""fast charge"" times quoted are the same as for the ""trickle charge"" rate. So, if you want to fast charge the phone; make sure the Bluetooth radio is turned off.********** UPDATE 2015-06-08 **********The much awaited Android L update has arrived... all 725.35 MB of it. Downloading is a foreground process... DO NOT navigate away from the Software Update screen while it is downloading! You must also have an active WiFi connection, as it is not a ""true"" OTA update; and you will receive a ""Please do not leave the WiFi coverage area"" warning message.",89,4
LG,"phone is locked, you said in the announcement that the phone was unlocked , I speak lie, now I have this phone here in the Dominican Republic and will not work for me",81,1
LG,"I ordered this phone Thursday before noon, selected Next Day which guaranteed delivery by Friday 8PM and it ended up arriving before noon. Excellent Turn around and while it obviously costed a bit extra it was worth the convenience of having the phone before the weekend. Only con to this was FedEx left it out front of the door and a signature was not needed- this is sometimes a plus for some but i would rather have an 'expensive' package signed for. Now, on to the device!I am going from a Nokia Lumia 920 that was ungracefully aging and is now about 2 years old. This phone literally doubles most specs and ties or beats all others. The screen is beautiful, navigating around the software is quick and easy. This phone has the same Snapdragon 800 CPU i have in my 8.4 Galaxy tablet and being it has a much smaller screen to run it flies! My tablet is no slouch either but this phone is extremely responsive and a pleasure to use. The battery life has been praised since it came out, it has a full 50% more than my lumia. It has 2 Gigs of ram, around 23GB of usable storage space which is plenty for me personally. As i'm setting up the phone periodically tips will come up to get the most out of it and it isn't condescending or annoying and once you've read and/or mastered the tip you can have it not show again as well. There are options to have things easier to use one handed such as the keyboard which to be honest for me is not necessary. The power and volume on the back is somewhat odd, I'm not at all used to it however, being able to just knock on the screen to wake it up as well as shut off the display eliminates the need to pick the phone up just to perform these tasks so it ends up being a plus as the perimeter of the device is void of any buttons. There is a notification LED on the front of the device that you can have set to notify you of seemingly everything and apparently one on the back as well which i have not used but looking at it i would guess it is just the camera flash being used for notifications as there are no other leds visible.Now again i am going from a 4.5"" screen to a 5.2"" screen. This is NOT a ""phablet"" in fact it is not uncomfortable AT ALL and i am making a switch to a screen size about 3/4"" larger which is sizable in terms of display real estate. I do not have massive hands I'd say 'average' but i have already used the keyboard and navigated everything with absolutely no problem. I am guessing this is because the side bezels are extremely thin, in addition to this, between the status bar at top, and the on screen navigation buttons on the bottom (these are on screen, NOT capacitive type buttons built into the device as on many other devices including my Lumia) the actual display size you are using for apps etc becomes less than 5.2 inches somewhere closer to 5"". The screen to body ratio as rated on GSM Arena is 75.9% meaning 75.9% of the front of the whole device, is screen. Keeping in mind there are usually sensors, a front facing camera ('selfie cam' ..ugh), the receiver speaker, and any leds, this is a very good ratio and to me, very desirable!I haven't played music but from notification sounds and ring tones the speakers are average, loud enough to hear but, you know its a phone- i'd never take any points or stars off for cell speakers but to each his own. I have not yet taken any pictures but from what i have researched online so far it appears to be only average quality as a whole. It is 13MP but this is always one of those deceiving specs as there are lesser MP cameras which take spectacular, detailed photographs and are more versatile such as in low light or on the move, close ups..etc. Unfortunately being i have not got into the 'field' to test it i am only going by others reviews of it. Optical image stabilization is a plus and for general photography this will suffice. The phone has Bluetooth v.4, infrared (which is completely unnecessary and i'd rather the cost go into something else), every current band of WiFi available including 'ac' and WiFi Direct so you can transfer files to and from devices with WiFi, and NFC which was a surprise to me. It does NOT have wireless charging which isn't too big a deal but obviously doing things without worrying about wires is the future, ymmv. I put my micro sim from my lumia into the G2 started her up and everything went up without a hitch.I am on AT&T network and was able to upgrade from the shipped android version of Kit Kat to Android 5.0.2 Lollipop which apparently was released only a few days ago for the device (lucky me!). While the phone is ""unlocked"" it is still AT&T branded (the AT&T 'world' logo is on back) and has a few of their apps, though i'd say not as many as if bought through AT&T directly but i am just guessing. I tried to be as thorough as possible in my review but as i have only had the phone for a day i can't provide any more information, hope this helps someone with their choice. There is the LG G4 coming out what seems like mid May or such for those that need latest and greatest but chances are if you are reading this you are not, and besides, this screen is already a FHD 424 pixel per inch 5.2"" beauty (the G4 is rumored to be 5.5"" QHD which would make for 534 PPI) and considering it has been on the market for a year and a half it does not look 'old' nor leave ME wanting for anything more besides perhaps the camera but AGAIN!!! For the price and everything it includes it truly is a fantastic deal! The only competition with respect to price and features are a few lesser known foreign brands but honestly, this is a well known brand and everything just works and for $260 shipped to my doorstep in 24 hours I'm content.",40,5
LG,"I had several Android phones for the last few years , from the Motorola Atrix ot the HTC one M& to the Galaxy S5 and a few in between , and then the Iphone 6 Plus came out last year so I decided to give it a try , after 6 month of using the Iphone I decided to go back to Android . the Iphone 6 plus while is a great piece of Hardware , the software I feel is not great for a big screen phone , I specially missed the android soft buttons at the botttom of the screen .Pros: While waiting for the next Android flagships to come out , I decided to purchase the LG G2 , and I could not be more impressed , while the G 2 has some weaknesses , the full package and the price more than make up for them . the 5.2"" 1080p screen size and very small bezels make this phone just perfect to hold in one hand . the Screen quality is top notch , once updated to Lollipop the software without lag and very snappy . and over all the hardware and software is very well done . the tap to wake the screen is a nice touch , the volume and power buttons on the back are very easy to use . Finally the main camera. Even by 2015 standards it holds its own. Great pictures In day time and not so good at night.On the software side this phone just got updated to Android lollipop 5.02, the latest android OS. Not too many phones in this price range will you find that can lay a claim to running the latest software.Cons : I will start out with the speaker , it is tinny , although not the worst on a cell phone that I have heard . the battery life is so so , again not the worst but not the best on an android cell hone either . The AT&T version comes full of carrier bloatware software , which if you are a tinkerer like me , you can easily root the phone and uninstall . spending a little over $200 , I did not have high expectations for this phone , but it has surprised me in a good way , and overall it is a great purchase for anyone looking to not spend flagship money and still wanting a decent phone . around this price there are lots of choices around but I feel that I made the right one .",21,5
LG,I have had a smart phone since 2009 I had a Samsung Infuse 4g but the differences between the two are very big. First the screen size seems to be just about right any bigger and I might as well just get a tablet. I have not experienced any slowness in anything I do even when trying to open as many things I can to try and slow it down.Contrary to the complaints I have read about with the double tap to turn the screen off and on I think it works pretty well ever though about 20 percent of the time it takes a couple tries to work. The back volume rocker button are different but I'm neutral to their placement at this point I don't accidentally hit them or anything however I forget sometimes where the power button is but I hardly ever use it dude the double tap feature.The data connection seems more than adequate as I get about 18Mbps down and anywhere from 5-10Mbps up while on 4g. I do not however like the default LG keyboard due to it taking up so much of the screen when texting someone however but that I believe its configurable and I just need to play with different settings to fix that.Another small complaint I have is actually with the camera it seems like it takes really good pictures however when zooming in somewhat or occasionally without zoom in it almost looks like it has a special effect that makes everything in the picture look like it was painted. However this is I'm sure also fixable as I learn the phone.My biggest draw to this phone and what made me choose it over the Nexus 5 was the battery life. I can wake up at 8am and take the phone off the charger and go all day with it. Just as an example as I write this review I have had it off the charger since 8am this morning and it is 12:30am the following day and I still have according to battery doctor 6 hours and 27 minutes (32%) battery remaining.Also another small complaint about the phone which I have seen others have is the notification bar. As other reviews I have the notification bar does have too much going on which if that was default settings and things could be removed it wouldn't be so bad but from what I have seen there is no way to modify the notification barCall quality is much better than on my Infuse 4g there is no fuzziness and no dropped calls. The one thing that does seem a little hit and miss is the speaker phone it almost seems to over sensitive when people talk like its trying to be as loud as it can but it just makes it hard understand the person you are talking to sometimes.None of these complaints in my opinion are enough to remove a star because the phone does exactly what its designed to do and that's to make calls and make you more productive.Pros:ScreenBattery LifeCamera (see cons as well)Data connection (4g)Double tap to wake and sleep screenCons:Camera (weird paint effect in pictures)Notification bar (too much going on)Speaker phone (hit and miss quality)Default LG keyboard (too large),14,5
LG,Phone came open - the cellophane wrapping the box was removed and the box was scuffed. The T-Mobile seal was broken as well as the phone had finger prints on it. The phone was undamaged. It wouldn't be a problem if I didn't buy a brand new item.Just be cautious.,12,3
LG,"I did some research before I bought this phone and I believe this phone best matched my needs without breaking my budget. I wanted a quality phone with plenty of memory and a good quality camera, since it always seems like my phone is the only one I have on me. The 13 MP camera was a biggie for me, and it really takes high quality photos. The internal ""usable"" memory (per specs from LG's website) is 24G, which meets my needs because I upload my photos to Shutterfly often to backup. However, If you are into a lot of games that take up space, this phone may not be for you since the memory isn't expandable. The apps preloaded on the phone are at least useful; I may root the phone when I get brave enough to do it so I can delete Some of that stuff. The preloaded apps are the main reason I gave the phone 4 stars instead of 5, because they advertise it as 32G memory. I was hoping to use the phone as a hotspot for my tablet, but haven't been able to use that since I believe you have to have the higher data plans at T-Mobile to do that. It appears that it would work fine because I was able to ""see"" my phone when I turned on the tablet's hotspot, but internet goes right to a t-Mobile error page. I haven't otherwise had any WiFi issues and I've used the feature every day. The phone is great at multitasking. The knock on feature is a little finicky but how hard is it to use the button to turn on as you would on any other phone? Doesn't bother me. The battery life is great. I get almost 3 days out of a charge. All in all this is a great phone for the money and is as good as current phone technology in most ways.",17,4
LG,"I received a phone with 4GB and not 8GB, that is why I am giving it 3 stars, but the award actually goes to: FGS Trading who sold this phone to me. Otherwise, the phone is a five star phone.After using it for three weeks, I can say I finally like it! I hate virtual keyboard, off course, haven't gotten used to it in the past weeks and never will since it is at least three times slower to type correct messages on it than on qwerty keyboard, and, I guess, I don't like to waste my time on texting more than I have to. I like the camera. Not perfect, not outstanding, but decent enough, so I got here what I was expecting. Speed of the phone - to me it is very fast. Pretty much, I have no complaints about how the phone works. But, let me discover what finally put a smile on my face: proper charging of the battery!!!If you want to extend the battery life on your phone by about 50%, do the following:- start charging your phone when it is in the ""red zone"", the more drained the better, but do not let it turn off because it is empty- charge it to 100%- take it off of your charger- restart your phone!Yes, it is that simple. And, off course, Google which applications drain your battery. I know some features on Google Now should be turned off.Battery on my phone, if I am using it mainly as a phone and mp3 player, lasts from 3 days 6 hours to 3 days 18 hours! If I am using wifi a lot, then around 2 days, which is still not bad for a smart phone, right? I have to say that I am not using my data plan at all and bluetooth is turned on only when I am actually using Bluetooth. And, Battery saver is turned on, meaning, when the battery is down to 30%, this mode turns on.*****UPDATE on November 6, 2014- Uninstall Google Now completely- turn of any auto-start applications that you do not need to be started and running in the background unless you want to use them- my auto-sync is turned off, too (I do sync my phone with Gmail, but when I want to do it)- put black or almost black desktop backgroundThe battery life on my phone is finally 4 days + a few more hours.As for the review of the phone itself - still snappy, decent photos, dual SIM function works very well. Still don't like virtual keyboard, but I am not as annoyed as in the beginning. I am happier and happier with this phone. I am going to change 4 to 5 starts now.",28,3
LG,The best affordable cell phone available in 2014. The battery lasts more than 3 days with light use and it shares the most interesting features from the more expensive LG G2. It pairs very well with Ultra Mobile in New York City where T-Mobile 1900 MHz HSPA+ is already available. Highly recommended.,14,5
LG,"This phone is just a state of the art device!Small, yet with a big screen, amazingly lightweight, very impressive battery life, and of course of you are familiar with andriod and know how to play with it - you can make it your most precious toy. Even though the CPU quad-core speed is only 1.2Ghz, it performs much much better than other quad core CPU-s I have tried in my past, particularly I think because of its dedicated nvidia video chip. This phone just refuses to hick up! Everything runs flawlessly and smoothly. The LG software design is also better than the Samsung ones in my opinion but it really kicks it on hardware design. And all for $200 and some change dollars. This phone ought to be the bestseller if it would just be discovered. Also another note: for those who have had it with various cell carriers contracts or no contracts - usually they'll sell you a phone that marries you to them. Sure the wiseguys amongst us can unlock phones and such but you'd still have the carrier's baked in software. NOT THIS ONE. It's unlocked and totally independent! - That's they way I like it!. Just replace the SIM card if you switch to another carrier and you're done.BEAUTIFUL JOB LG!",10,5
LG,"Nonetheless this is a close to being flawless mid-grade phone in terms of design. I'm not going to go in depth since it's quite easy to look up reviews on YouTube. However I will point out some fact.For USA users. This phone will never get 4G LTE, as far as I know, no bands in America supports any of the LTE bands.I have T-Mobile and I'm only receiving EDGE (2G) for data. HSPA or HSPA+ (3G) is practically non-existent unless you're in a T-Mobile re-framed area that supports 1900mhz. Only then would you receive 3G or 4G, which means if you're in a rural area, you're kinda outta luck.For AT&T users, you're in better luck. You won't get 4G LTE, but for the most part you'd still be connected to 3G or normal 4G, because AT&T 3G/4G runs on this phone's 3G frequencies, 850mhz and 1900mhz band. You might think that because this phone supports 4G LTE 2100mhz you'd get LTE, but in order for AT&T 4G LTE to work, you also need 1700mhz along with 2100mhz.Another problem is, the messaging app limits the MMS size to only 300kb, which sucks if you want to send something larger. Otherwise you kinda get what you paid for. But If I was you, look at Moto G. Cheaper and better band support.Also the screen tends to flicker when at 0% brightness. Not horrible, but still noticeable.There isn't a notification light, but instead the screen lights up when you receive a text.The LED flash sucks and washes out your photo if you're taking a photo up close.This phone is amazing for the price, but sadly I'm stuck with EDGE, and that is really limiting. Sending and receiving photos with EDGE makes it close to being impossible, since the connection would drop and then your picture would stay downloading or sending forever, and then you would either have to send them again or ask for your friend to send you the photo again.",39,3
LG,"Sold by Phone-Zone, phone came sealed which is good (The only good I think), phone WAS NOT AN UNBRANDED as advertised (IT was advertised as D620R/international version) in the end I got a VODAFONE Spain version BRANDED 620 (It had one Vodafone app and the bootanimation was Vodafone logo),this is unacceptable! I wasted almost two days making work my 4G(Digitel/Venezuela, Band3,1800)with the software it came it was IMPOSSIBLE(Even dialing*#*#INFO#*#*would give me a error)had to connect to LG PC Suite, but now it doesn't show Spanish as option! So I had two options: English with 4G (Which is unacceptable) or Spanish with 3G and Vodafone Branded (Unacceptable as well). And even working at English, there is a documented problem with stock SMS app (it doesn't work), so I had to install a third party app for SMS (Textra). Incredible.Attached pictures of the bootanimation it came with (An internet image, not the actual phone) and a picture of the box where it says ""D620"" (Without the R) and it says ""VDI"" with is the carrier code for VODAFONE.",26,1
LG,first of all the cell phone came white and black I ordered. Also it does not seem to be an original version of LG G3 beat as it has the brand logo behind or in front of the cell phone and it came in a box that is not original brand or model. Also the cell only came with a charger did not bring original headphones or manuals. the cell phone also has problems displaying photos and video files that are made with the phone.,51,2
LG,"This is a FAKE phone!! In the pictures it shows a whole diffrent phone but once you get it, oh you'll be MAD",37,1
LG,"Great inexpensive unlocked LG cellphone, was a gift for my wife and she is very happy with it. Works fine with our 3G network here in Costa Rica! I will be buying one for my self soon...",11,5
LG,"Reached within 24 hours of me placing the order. This is 100% original LG phone and please ignore all the reviews where they claim it is not. It is exactly the size, shape and form as described. Works flawlessly! Connects to my ATT microcell too. The only minor issue is that when you reset to factory, it defaults to Japanese language. But it takes one click to move it to English and i really dont see that to be any issue. The other thing is that the keyboard is the old style but it took me about 30 seconds to download google keyboard from google play. Honestly, i think this is an awesome phone for the price and features and service you get. If you have any second thoughts, trust me on it and go for it! You will love it too",30,5
LG,When I received my phone it was some sort of copy phone or fake because it doesn't even LG symbol on front or back but they did respond very quickly and now I'm returning it and wait for my refund. Thank You,12,1

LG,"I purchased this phone thinking it would work well in the United States. Well... This model was designed and marketed for a foreign country. While it will work in the United States, the fact that it was designed for another country has caused several negative issues: 1. None of the instructions were in English. 2. The charger was designed for a country other than the United States, but it did come with an extension adapter would would allow you to use it in the United States. The problem with that is that, once you added the adapter, the charger became 4"" long, which is not very compact or travel friendly. 3. The phone was factory loaded with TONS of applications designed for foreign countries which clogged up the internal storage memory and are also useless in the United States, and the worse part is that you cannot delete them from the phone. This phone is equipped with a Quad-Core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 Processor. I have used other phones that are equipped with this processor and I have not experienced any real speed issues, but this phone really dragged, especially when switching apps, and this became quite frustrating. Another problem which I have only experienced with this phone is if you are using a map app for navigation and you switch apps, upon returning to the map app, your location is lost and you have to re-enter the address and restart the navigation. This is not only annoying, but also dangerous if you are driving. Now for the worst part... 3 weeks after purchasing this phone, the WiFi stopped working. The phone showed that the WiFi was turned on, but it was getting no signals from any of the WiFi networks that I normally connect to. All in all, without exaggerating, this is one of the worst phones that I have owned. I am just glad that I am a Prime customer and that I am able to ship it back with no hassles.",13,1
LG,Cant even get on the LTE network on this unlocked phone.,14,1
LG,I would give zero stars if available.They sold the used piece to me with different charger and headphones and it sucks.Don't trust it and better to avoid this,17,1
LG,I bought this because of the great reviews. Everything was working great once I got the phone set up but despite multiple attempts I can not get it to recognize the SD card. I used one I had but no luck. Then I bought a new one from Amazon and tried formatting that two different ways but no luck. Mount SD is just greyed out. I looked online to get help and it looks like I am not alone. The SD card is a huge reason I bought this. My Nexus 5 had NO storage. SO this is a big deal to me.***UPDATE: I got another G3 from Good Guy Electronics and am VERY happy. SD card reader is working so it is clear to me that the first phone I got from Breed was defective. I am also starting to wonder if the Breed phone was used or refurbished but labeled new. Below is a picture of the two phone packaging next to each other. The one on the left is from Good Guys which also looks like packaging that I saw G3 comes in when I went to Best Buy. Overall I love Amazon because as soon as I told them the phone was defective I got a refund. Great customer service and the reason I am such a loyal customer.,30,5
LG,Oh yeah and because of your great customer service I was able to capture this beautiful moment at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado <3 Thanks again,12,5
LG,"First off, I got this version since I have Cricket (who was recently bought by AT&T) and it works awesome. 4G and everything is functional. I've had no issues with this phone.I did notice the phone heats up easy but I believe it's just due to the screen size, and near everyone experiences this problem. I don't think is takes from the phone too much.It works great, the camera is awesome. Both front and back cameras that is. The sound quality is impressive. I'm very happy with this & would definitely recommend it to a friend or anyone.",20,4
LG,"I upgraded from the HTC One M8..I really liked my HTC One M8, but it had some quirks that got to m me, very bad auto correct, small screen, etc.. I Loved the build, it was nice and solid. But I went for it and bought LG G3 and have been so very impressed. I really love this phone. I held the galaxy S6 in the store to check it out, It was flashy but not for me. The 5.5"" Screen on the G3 is amazing. Unlocked. Works flawless. The camera is amazing. 4HD distillery Is spectacular. I love the double tap on the screen to wake up or sleep.. there are so many awesome features about this phone. I like the new LG G4 but its not really a huge improvement from the G3, only the camera.. I doubt I'll upgrade anytime soon. Even if the phone breaks and I have to buy a new one, I'll buy another G3.. It has everything I need and was hoping for, no bugs so far..$350 less than the galaxy S6. I actually bought mine used on Amazon and it was as good as new..lol. Anyone on the fence go for the LG G3, buy it and you will not regret it. I bought the Circle Case that allows you to see certain apps, or have access to your camera, music, messages, make a phone call all with the front cover closed. The Circle Case is my favorite accessory for a phone I have ever had to date.. I hope this helps. I personally feel the 5.5 screen is perfect size.did I mention how much I love my Slate Blue 3gb Ram, 32gb Rom, 128gb sdmicro inserted by me... The phone is flawless in my opinion. I'm very happy. In my cart I had S6, note4 edges and LG G3 for almost 2 weeks going back and forth... I am very happy to have my Lucky Goldstar G3.",11,5
LG,"I have switched to LG G3 from Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, which is one of the early generations of smartphones. In general, I loved the LG G3 phone. It has a large screen and it is totally responsive with great touch experience and a lot of features. I ordered the phone twice from two different sellers. I will share my experience with this phone in two sections. The first is my review for the LG G3 in general and the second is about some problems I ran into, that I believe are specific to the D850 model.My Experience with LG G3-----------------------------------------+ Large screen. I was reluctant at the beginning to buy a large phone with such large screen (5.5""). I though it will be hard to manage a large phone carrying it around in my pocket. However, I believe I was mistaken. This phone is great and it definitely worth to carry it around, which turned out to be not as hard as I was expecting.+ Great touch experience. The phone is really responsive and LG has done great job by adding some animations and swipe effects that makes the experience with the touch screen better. The knock code feature is also working great.+ Computation power. This phone comes with a strong processor and a 3GB of ram, which in my opinion are enough for handheld devices at this time. I have played 3D single- and multi-player games with this phone and it was a great experience. No lags or freezes.+ Upgradable operating system. The phone comes with KitKat operating system, but it is upgradable to Lollipop from AT&T servers.+ Unlocked phone. The phone is unlocked as described. I have tried it with T-Mobile and H2O (based on AT&T network).+ Communication. The LG G3 supports wide range of communication technologies, including Quad-GSM, 2G/EDGE, 3G, 4G LTE (multiple bands). I believe the D850 is the most capable model in this regard. It supports a wide range of 4G LTE bands, including those that are used by T-Mobile. However, I found out that the 3G is disabled in the D850 model as will be explained in the other section.- Battery Life. Based on my usage, which is moderate (checking emails, some browsing, and a few calls), the battery lasts around a day. I mean you have to charge it every night. I may be comparing to my old phone, in which the battery lasts for 3 days at least. Based on what I hear from my friends who have different brands, such as Galaxy 5 or iPhone, I guess this is acceptable.- Heating. I have experienced a little heating problems. However, this is only visible when you download large files or play heavy games.Problems I faced with the D850 model--------------------------------------------------------I experienced the following problems with this phone. Not sure if they are in all phones or there was something wrong with the specific piece I got. I am reporting them anyway.- 3G Support. I found out that 3G is disabled in this model (you can only use 2G or 4G). Although the hardware should support that, but it is disabled by the AT&T firmware. No idea why. I found out that you can enable this, but you have to root your device. I have not tried it myself.- I had a problem using the 4G LTE with the H2O network. When I am connected to the LTE network, I cannot receive calls. Also, if I place calls while connected to LTE, the connection will drop to EDGE and it will remain this way. I searched the net and found out that this may be because of a limitation in the H2O network. Looks like it is missing some protocols to overcome this issue. The H2O rep could not do anything to have this working. I assume it should be working fine with AT&T since it is an AT&T branded model.- No 4G LTE with T-Mobile. Although some people in the net are saying that they managed to use T-Mobile LTE network with the D850 model, I could not have this to work. I talked to T-Mobile rep twice and they could not help me get this to work. It only connects to the EDGE network. The hardware of D850 should cover the T-Mobile LTE bands except band 12. I am not sure if this can be fixed if the device is rooted.- Wireless charging. Based on what I learned from the net, the D850 does not support Qi wireless charging. It supports another protocol called PMA. I have not tried it myself, but what I have noticed that not all D850 phones come with the wireless charging antenna at the back of the phone cover. As I mentioned earlier, I ordered from two sellers, one of the phones has the wireless charging antenna while the other does not.- The manufacturer warranty may be voided in US. You have to contact your seller before you buy if this is important for you.Overall, I believe the LG G3 is a great phone. It has a high computing power, usable interface, and it is good looking with a high screen to body ratio, which was one of the main factors for me choosing this phone. I believe if you are planning to use it with AT&T, you will not have the communication problems that I have experienced.",28,4
LG,Received my LG G3 D850 and it was as described. The phone is the AT&T version D850. It was important to me to get the AT&T version because they have great service in Dallas Ft Worth where I live. I am a Tracfone customer and have been for 12 years and I wanted my new phone to be able to take advantage of Tracfone's bring your own phone plan (BYOP) and work on the AT&T network. This LG G3 D850 version phone was the answer. After installing my Tracfone AT&T SIM and following Tracfone's online setup I was up and running within 30 minutes. I now get 4G LTE service thru AT&T while paying Tracfone's low no contract price. For those looking for outstanding service with no contract this is one answer. The phone came with Android 5.01.,12,5
LG,"Phone sold as new was clearly used. It came shrinkwrapped in branded packaging, however, the phone lacked protective coverings as seen clearly in any in boxing video. Upon turning the phone on there was noticable light bleed down the left hand side of the screen as it was delaminating or not seated properly. There were also dead pixels and a very noticeable light spiderwebbing underneath the glass, kind of as if it had been dropped and the LCD was damaged. Upon the first boot up, I pressed the square navigation key and was met with several programs I did not launch. One of these was the camera app which clearly showed the face of another person in there room. This phone was clearly used and damaged by the previous owner. The deception of re shrinkwrapping the box and representing it as new is not only unappreciated by a buyer spending nearly $300 on an item, but very lazy also, as it's condition was not passable in the slightest.",14,1
LG,"The phone came out of the box faulty. The screen has an issue where is flickers and fades to black, makes the phone completely unusable. I bought this phone for my mom's birthday and it is a complete disappointment because this phone is unusable and no amount of googling for a solution could find a fix",11,1
LG,Recieved a Refurbished piece...Box was not sealed....Battery was already in the phone...Battery protector on the back of the cover was not proper like a new one...Duplicate charger...Trsvel adapter printed instead of Travel Adapter...Very much Disappointed...,159,1
LG,"Apparently some people are getting a refurbished version. I ended up getting a brand new one, nothing was open and everything looked untouched. This phone is awesome for the price. Its almost a one and a half year old model but it out performs any new phone under $300 by a landslide. I dont know why people get new phones under $400 when you can get so much more out of a one year old premium model for the same or lower price. Like this phone, the sony Xperia z3 and nexus 6 all are very good phones and have drastically been lowered in price.Anyway I have had this phone for about 3 months now. Overall it has good software. I have had lg phones for a few years and i dont see why people say lgs software isnt good, aside from a little too much bloatware never really saw anything bad. The camera is very good especially for a year old phone but of course its not as good as the newest models like the galaxy s6 etc. The screen clarity is about as good if not better than some of the best phones today. The ability to multi task is very well made, i dont use it often but when i do it works good. Its also fast and plays even the bigest games smoothly. The battery works great i can pretty much always get threw a 6am till 4pm work day without having to charge it. Also its removable so overtime once the battery gets worn out you can just replace it or have a spare battery if it does happen to die during the day and cant charge it. Then of course the buttons on the back of it. I think it works very well and are placed in a nice spot but if you have never used an lg phone with the buttons on back, it takes a little time to get use to it.Some other little cool things it has is, NFC, Remote control, up to 2TB of storage, face detection etc.Overall a great phone for the price, nice camera, good looking screen, has a nice build to it, good battery useage and gets fairly new updates.9.5/10",10,5
LG,"Perfect, exactly what I ordered. Correct model number and everything. Checked IMEI on Ting Mobile and Tracfone and both are good to go (US, north carolina). I was surprised tracfone's service is compatible with it. (haven't started either service yet)Easy one-click root and everything. Came with android version 4.4.2. I installed the Xposed Installer along with the Apps Setting module and now I can change the DPI settings for each app individually. I can make the text as small as I want to make use of the 2k (1440p) screen.Screen does overheat when left on max brightness for long periods of time. But I'm fine with the screen brightness at 40%, I rarely use it outside.I don't recommend anti-glare screen protectors with this high resolution screen. Adds a bunch of annoying noise to the screen. Random points of color you wouldn't notice on a lower resolution screen. Get one of those Clear/HD screen protectors.I recommend Moon+ Reader for e-book reading. Pre-download all the google translate stuff too, being able to translate from images instantly is amazing. AndrOpen Office for Office documents is a good tool to have on hand. Make sure to get a file browser too, I recommend File Manager HD.",50,5
LG,"When I bought this phone I was really excited, and I was VERY DESAPPOINTED when I received the phone in a box looking really old, when I opened the box the phone looked scratch, used, nothing what I was expecting, the description said Brand New and is not....very unhappy...I had no choice but returned it",49,2
LG,The phone has some pros and consBaterry it's good enoughScreen amazingConsThe infrared led doesn't work I don't know if it's damaged it seem it is nothing connectedI can't update the phone doesn't give me the option in options and I was thinking if the phone is generic,11,3
LG,"I've been using this phone for a few weeks now after switching off my Galaxy S3. I loved the GS3 when it was new but it's been showing its age and slowing down tremendously.The LG G3 is a great successor. It's mostly vanilla Android which is great but there are a few cool features I use a lot.1) double tap on the screen to turn on/off - love not having to feel around the back for the power button only to (inevitably) press on the camera lens (if there was any downside to the design, that would be it. Circular power button just below the circular camera? not smart, LG)2) This was a one time setup thing, but using NFC to pull my settings and apps from my GS3 to the G3 was awesome and such a time saver. Well done, Android!One more thing, I was looking at this phone over some of it's competitors mostly to get the best camera in an android phone and this does not disappoint. It has taken crystal clear pictures. I really like the camera interface and I like how I can use hand gestures to take the picture. This makes taking a selfie with my baby to send to my wife a snap (HA! get it?).",11,5
LG,I payed for a new product and i recieved an used one. It has a scratch at the bottom and dirt inside.,11,1
LG,"This phone works outstandingly well for Android device. I have one complaint only: The preinstalled software would prevent me from setting my preferred data access configuration. It has the option of defining a new APN, but it does not work. It keeps saying that the APN type is not supported unless tmo is entered. If later APN name is edited settings are deleted without warning. Luckily for me, the default tmo APN works with my provider: Consumer Cellular.",26,4
LG,I LOVE this phone! I was so worried that I was getting a used or refurbished phone and was so relieved and ecstatic when it arrives and was brand new! It is GSM unlocked. It says T-Mobile on the back of the phone but I have Cricket Wireless and it works perfectly. The only feature that did not work was the Wi-Fi calling but that's just becuz I don't have T-Mobile,12,5
LG,"Update: Beware when buying this. I have had many problems with this phone to the point that I had to send it to LG for service. They accepted Amazon's order receipt for proof of warranty but they sent it right back because they said it was not a new phone. The phone id did not match the serial number. I bought this through the marketplace where is was listed as ""NEW"". I added a pic to show the labels that LG put on it before returning it. The seller was contacted but never got back to me. Thankfully Amazon offered to accept it for a refund. Cheers to Amazon for redressing this lousy experience in the marketplace.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI wrecked the digitizer on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and I wasn't due for another because of my contract. I wanted to get an inexpensive unlocked phone in case I wanted osay goodby to my phone company in the future. I was not happy with most options but found this LG G3. 3 gigs of ram. quad-core processor up to 128 bg flash drive... great specs.The good:Beautiful 4K screen.I like the button and volume control in the back of the phone so you don't hit it while you're holding the phone by the sides.Fast processingNot too much bloatware (the phone is originally at T-Mobile phone so it has some)Phone works well with ATT (although I had to have customer service walk me though setting up data network)The bad (and sadly there are quite a few)Battery life is dreadful - brand new and with low brightness on the screen the phone has a hard time lasting a day!Screen is very touchy. And since there is not much bezel (which looks nice) you hit the screen a bit too much.Some times calls simply don't come through and it is not the network because my wife uses the same system ad does not have these problems.Looses signal both voice and data very often and has trouble re-connecting to network.For some unknown reason the digitizer developed a dead zone recently so that it won't recognize my touch on the top on the screen when vertical. This does not allow me to type when on internet or other apps where the search or address box is on the top.Do I recommend this phone? Not really sure. It is a nice phone but frankly there may be a better one out there.",15,1
LG,"A bit deceiving that the box claims it's a Dual LTE phone - it's not. SIM 1 supports LTE, but SIM 2 slot is limited to 2G only. So it's dual-sim but not dual LTE. Other than that, it's really awesome!",16,4
LG,"I love this phone, and if your going g to put it on straight talk. Also buy the activation kit for the CDMA if you want it on Verizon towers.",12,5
LG,"i bought this phone to use on the straight talk network. while traveling i came to areas where the phone just didnt have any service or i would only have data or talk. i called up straight talk they said that yes i was on verizon towers but i did not have verizon service. so i then got a verizon sim card. hoping that i will have better service. still verizon but not technically verizon. since there is an order to the calls and data based off of whether you are contract or prepaid. i called att and asked if i could use their sim card in the phone. they said i could but it would not work how it was supposed to. so the CDMA/GSM statement in the title has me perplexed. though there are settings within the phone that lets you switch between GSM and CDMA. so fingers crossed that in 3 days my phone works where it hadn't before. i do not live on my phone. it is just convenient to have to do basically everything on. So straighttalk works though it does not work like verizon prepaid as verizon prepaid does not work exactly like verizon contract. this phone being on a verizon contract would be the best option if you rely on your phone for everything.the phone is great. the camera is fantastic. though the photos i take and videos can only be viewed on the phone since i do not own a 4k tv. i have always wanted this phone. now i have it. hopefully for a very long time.*****UPDATE***** even with verizon as my prepaid provider. i still can not make phone calls where a normal verizon phone can. i have data but no voice. the phone says ""extended service"" yet i have no service.i should have just stayed with straight talk and att instead of getting verizon prepaid. we dont come here too much. but this is the 2nd time in a month. i can make calls with google dialer, though i can not receive them.also with verizon prepaid everything extra is an upcharge. i do get service at my mothers. which i didnt get before with straighttalk att. its just upsetting when you get something and are told by a verizon sales rep that it will work. then a month later finding out it doesn't.",22,5
LG,I received a blacklisted phone. Meaning my IMEI was blocked and I can't use the phone to call or text,23,1
LG,"I loved this phone--it has the perfect camera and hardware. However, I started running into problems with using my camera--it goes into an infinite reboot and render my phone useless. The factory reset didn't solve the problem.",13,1
LG,"~~~UPDATE AFTER OWNING FOR 3 MONTHS~~~ 11/26/2016Edit: Works on Tmobile's 4G LTE. Skip to the bottom for instructions.It's a sleek and stylish phone with plenty of things going for it, especially it's camera. ***PLEASE go to you're local phone or electronic to store to see this phone for yourself. It's your money so it will ultimately be your opinion that will decide if you like it or not*** This is an in depth review of my thoughts, opinion and experience. If you don't like reading then skip to the bottom, but if you're like me and want something more than what every person keeps repeating on every review then continue reading.~~I will be periodically updating this review as time goes on.~~Day 1: The phone just arrived today and I've been 100% satisfied with my purchase. My first impressions was wow, the vendor, Wireless Place, actually sent a USA wall plug adapter. No clue of it's quality, definitely won't be trying it on my new phone but it's the thought that counts so they get kudos for that. The phone comes in a nice white and red box. I read another persons review that they didn't get the Quadbeats 3 headphones in their box, but mine came with it. Side note, those headphones are the nicest pair I've ever had. No clue about the microphone quality though. Back to the phone, it's very sleek and surprisingly light. I've only owned 1 smartphone before this, which was the Xperia Z and it feels lighter. The phone is curved so it feel amazing to hold. Coming from a square phone to this, it's like heaven. The leather back definitely adds style, grip and quality. If you don't mind that it's real cow leather I would recommend you get one in your choice of color. Be warned though, some of the different leather types also have different texture. The brown/tan I got, has a smooth finish. No clue about others, as I've said, please go to your local stores and see this phone for yourself. On the first startup, it runs a little warm. That's understandable since it's using a lot of processing power to boot everything and set things up for the first time. After that, I haven't experienced any heating issues. I did notice the phone get a little choked up on a couple points but that too is understandable since I was installing all my apps at one time. That issue hasn't reoccurred, either. The screen looks fantastic, and looks great in direct sunlight too. I love the UI and the icons of this phone. Usually I hate whatever preinstalled apps phone makers install, e.g. Sony, but LG did a fantastic job. The ones that they've installed are actual apps that I'll use like the notification board that tells you the weather as well as other info or the LG health that counts steps. Now for the best part and what many of us are intrigued about, which is the 16 megapixel f1.8 camera. It's safe to say that it's probably THE BEST or Top 2 of it's kind. I'm an amateur photographer and I shoot manually with film camera so I know my way around. This camera won't replace your fancy DSLR but it sure will put your point and shoot ones to shame. I need more time to play around with the manual mode but simple/auto produces some nice pictures. On top of that LG did a fantastic job in arranging the UI for the manual mode. All in all this phone is worth it, especially since this is $100-200 cheaper than other flags ships, I'm looking at you Sony. If you're like me and you don't upgrade your phone every year, then this phone might be it for you. Not only does it have expandable microSD storage, but also a removable battery. This is big coming from an Xperia Z which does have a microSD storage but not a removable battery. Using my Z for 2 years has made the battery inefficient, but now no longer do I have to worry. I can just go order another battery pack if anything happens to my LG G4 unlike Sony, Apple or Samsung.As of yet, I have no gripes besides the speakers being in the back. We will see if this remains true after the 1 week, 1 month and 6 month updatesIn short, this phone is great. I don't care about ""premium build quality"" (Glass and Aluminium). I care about practicality and this phone hits it right on the mark. If you get the leather back, it feels 10 times more premium then any other phone I've touched. The camera is fantastic, the screen is bright and colorful, the curved nature of the phone makes its to hold and on top of that it's at a great price compared to other brands. Also more importantly it works in the US with Tmobile!***Edit T-Mobile 4G LTE setup(Step by step pics included): Yes in fact it does use T-mobile's 4G LTE data. You just need to manually set it in your data settings by choosing the network that says ""GSM/WCDMA/LTE auto"". Then click on ""Access point names"" then click ""T-mobile GPRS"" and finally click the VPN. Change the address to ""fast.t-mobile.com"". MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE DASH between Tmobile or it wont work. Then press the settings on the top right corner and save.***~~~UPDATE after 3 months~~~ 11/26/2015As it stands, this phone is still great! Even though LG has released the V10 which updates and improves the things that this phone ""lacked"" such as a heartbeat sensor, fingerprint lock, manual video control and such. I still believe this phone is a great contender still. Most of the new features on the V10 aren't something I need. The phone has survived its fair share of drops, thankfully I have a Caseology Wavelenght case, which it does it's job. If you're experiencing charging issues with the phone, where it keeps disconnecting a certain positions, try buying new micro USB cables. I bought a 5 pack of Anker micro-usb cables and they've fixed the problems. The connectors on the micro-usb heads probably get worn down from all the connecting and disconnecting that it can't make a proper contact to charge. Other than that, I've found no issue with the phone. It'd be nice to get the Marshmallow update, but I don't mind. Lollipop 5.1 is very stable so I can't complain.",71,5
LG,"I bought this LG G4 (INTERNATIONAL VERSION) from Amazon and the other day it froze for the first time. I went to restart the phone but it wouldn't load past the LG welcome screen.I did some online research and found out that this problem is quite common with the LG G4. It is a manufacturers DEFECT (commonly referred to a BOOT LOOP)I called LG here in the U.S. and they said that they couldn't do anything about it because it is an international version. They recommended that I contact LG KOREA as you should be able to fix my cell phone or send me a replacement G4.I could not reach LG Korea as there is no customer service number available to us in the U.S.Now, I am stuck with a G4 that doesn't work (I spent over $400 on it) after only 5 months of use. No one wants to make themselves responsible for it. Isn't that nice?",46,1
LG,"So far this is my worst experience with Amazon, I have bought LG G4 factory unlocked phone one week back, the product was delivered on time and I was happy about that. I am very concerned with the quality of the product. Issues with the phone started to pop up from the very next day, some time with the charging,some times with the phone heat, and some times with the phone functionality. Primarily with the charging, after hooking up to charge for almost 5 hrs only 20% of charging is done, and during that time the phone got lot of heat. This happened to me couple of times so far. Features in the phone are really good I liked them but when the most important thing for the phone is not working properly it doesn't matter what kind of features you have in the phone. Initially I thought the issue might be a one of case and will not be repeated, but after using more than a week and had the same issue repeated couple of times, I don't think I can compromise with this further long. I have decided to return this item. I recommend to buy this phone directly from store but not online...",13,1
LG,"This charger/battery pack is great! I got it for the LG G4 and the battery works perfect. The white charger plugs in to any micro USB and holds the spare battery, it opens like a little book. Would highly recommend for anyone whose LG G4 battery is dying too fast on them. I swap the batteries in the morning so that I always have a fully charged one once i start the day.",11,5
LG,This has been the best purchase I could have ever made. The LGG4 has a very disappointing battery and I have discovered that my phone does not like to connect with chargers. I purchased this so that I could just trade out an almost dead battery for a fully charged battery and keep the cycle going. Despite this being a hassle I love this charger. It charges the battery via wall socket and charger cord. It has been working daily since I purchased it several months ago. I haven't had any issues with it at all and if you own an LGG4 I highly recommend you invest in this gem!,20,5
LG,"absolutely a beautiful phone.. and the price to specs ration is amazing. you get so much for not so much money, I paid $375, and I am so happy. I added a 128GB SD card made by Samsung and it works flawlessly. I definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade. you get 5.5 qHD display, multi windows, floating windows, voice commands, and so much more, I use this phone on Straight Talk and had no problems inserting the AT&T sim card 4g LTE and it worked with no problems. I traveled to the U.S. Virgin islands and when I got there I about a local simm card, I removed my Straight Talk simm card replaced it with their local simm card, i did need to update my APN but that was easy and it work just fine. coming back to the States I popped in my straight talk simm back in and had no problems..",70,5
LG,"Update October 22, 2016:Decided to bite the bullet and cancelled my grandfathered Verizon unlimited data plan for Cricket. Porting over my phone number was handled by the sales reps, and I just need to switch the micro-SIM and configure the APN for Cricket's domains. Data and texts seem to be working fine. Consider this an anecdotal data point that the US991 version of the phone can work on Cricket, and by extension AT&T. Now oddly relieved that I didn't get the Verizon exclusive version, such that the hassle described below was accidentally worth it.---First, to address a few follow-up questions for this review since it was first posted:- Even if technically the phone (US991) can be activated on a Verizon subscription, it seems like a trend for Verizon reps to not help with the activation process, since it requires them to manually input the device codes printed directly on the battery bay. Buyer-beware if you don't want to spend time debating that yes, the phone is not just a GSM phone and that it supports CDMA bands as well.- The US991 doesn't appear to support simultaneous data + voice on Verizon's network. On the other hand, it has built-in software support for WiFi tethering (which the Verizon version allegedly cripples). There is no FM radio chip.---Amazon could a do better job of updating the product description, based on uncertainty about carrier activation in the review. I got the US991 model (for US Cellular). On my first trip to the Verizon store, their representative told me that my phone was a GSM-only model and that they couldn't activate it. After a series of frustrating exchanges with Amazon sales reps, I decided to check directly with LG and get the specs of the phone model. After determining that the bands should be supported, I printed some supporting documentation and made a second trip to the Verizon store. I got a different representative this time, and they were able to manually input the device code into the Verizon subscription system and activate my phone (much credit to them for not giving up when scanning didn't work, and for not forcing me to debate specs with them). So far, the phone as been doing great for the past couple weeks. For anyone worried about the Sprint model recall back in 2015, the manufacture date of my received phone was 03/2016, so hopefully the related issues are not present in later models.Key takeaways:- Don't trust the Amazon and Verizon representatives to know anything about the phone. A Verizon representative may even claim you have the wrong network type for your model if they are feeling lazy. Best do your research on the phone you receive before making an activation trip.- On the other hand, LG customer support was very helpful in explaining how CTIA's ""Consumer Code for Wireless Service"" works, and why a (unlocked) US Cellular model should work on the Verizon network. They deserve a star in my book.- Overall, the lack of clarity in the product description is disappointing, and the stress of having to do independent research in the face of contradicting assertions was exhausting. It was nice of Amazon to offer a return postage label at no cost, and I'm not sure whether it's fair to expect Amazon sales reps to perform research about the phone model they are answering questions on.- I'm rating this 4 stars because even if Amazon customer support was not that helpful, in the end the activation issues were not their fault. I just wish they were able to clue me in sooner that the issue was on Verizon's end and not due to the phone model I received. And to reiterate, LG support and the second Verizon representative were awesome. Hopefully this review is a helpful data point for those uncertain about the product description.TLDR version: Got the model US991 which worked with my Verizon subscription, but had to endure the angst of working with customer service representatives from Amazon/Verizon. Don't expect this to be a smooth purchase until you've gotten the phone activated (and hold off on buying accessories as well).",37,4
LG,"Despite giving the LG G4 3 stars, I did find it to be a mostly enjoyable experience. Here is a breakdown:Pros:+1080P images on the screen look excellent+The speaker on the phone is actually decent+Still uses the microUSB standard+The lock button is position on the back of the device. This is great because your hand naturally rests on the back and makes a quick and easy unlock+The camera is top notch! 16MP is pretty great on a phone and you will not be disappointed.+The leather backing is really nice to hold and gives a moderate amount of grip. Most days I go without a case because I love the leather.+Ability to change the battery and add a microSD card! I missed the ability to upgrade my storage from when I had a Galaxy S5.Cons-The backing pops off every time I remove a case from my phone and I am afraid it will break every time-The LG UI is pretty restrictive by Android standards, though I was pleased to see Marshmallow 6.0 out of the box.-The battery is pretty bad. This is one of the biggest reasons I gave the LG G4 a 3 star rating, and why I ultimately got rid of it.-Sometimes Apps bug or crash. I am sure this is just a software issue as the G4 has pretty good specs besides.-The screen is very dark. This was also a big concern for me because in the summer time here in Alaska, we have sunlight most of the day and damn it's bright!Overall:The LG G4 was an excellent phone besides the lacking battery life and low brightness screen. For $300 it is a great buy and it even comes unlocked!",35,3
LG,"I cannot put my new LG G4 down long enough! A few weeks ago, I switched to Cricket, did a BYOD and well my phone did not work with their service. So I had to purchase a cheap phone to hold me over until I could purchase the phone I WANTED. The cheap phone drove me crazy and was almost thrown out the window, I regretted changing to Cricket. But after receiving my new LG G4 from Amazon and getting it completely set up, it's lightening fast and I couldn't be happier with changing services. I love this phone!I have a ""baking hobby"" and take a lot of pictures to upload to my Facebook page. This truly is a fantastic camera phone, the quality and detail are amazing. That is the main reason I researched and bought this phone. The call quality is good, but I was talking to someone who was standing outside in the wind, so that may have been the issue... lol. There is just so much to this phone to list. I couldn't be happier!",11,5
LG,"I bought this phone to replace an LGG2 that crapped out on me. Received this phone on April 27 2016. Here it is August 5 2016. The phone has completely shut down after numerous screen freezes. It started off restarting itself...screen freeze...restarting,..then turning off completely. Now it's just dead. Pretty expensive piece of junk.I'd add a photo to this but all you would see is a dead phone.OH- it has passed the return date of one month so no return or replacement.Bottom line is twice I have been screwed by LG. Never again will I buy an LG phone or anything else made by LG. All junk with a crap return policy. Should be called LC - Life's Crap!",11,1
LG,"Fantastic phone at a great price. Phone was exactly as described and was brand-new, factory sealed packaging with waranty papers included and was unlocked as advertised. Great seller, quick ship, perfect transaction--would higly recommend.",34,5
LG,"I bought this G4 to replace my Samsung Galaxy S5, and so far, I like it better than the S5. The main (and most impressive) positive about the LG G4 is the camera; I've never had a better camera phone. The picture and video quality is impressive. I also like that the screen is 5.5 inches (which fits well in my baseball gloves for hands). The one negative (and really the only negative I've found so far) is the touch sensitivity while texting/typing. Almost every time I send a text, the keyboard misses one or two of my space-bar touches. It definitely gets annoying; I've downloaded other keyboard apps, to no avail.",30,4
LG,"Great phone. Received the US991 model, which apparently is the US Cellular model, but there was no US Cellular software on the phone, just LG's version of Marshmallow out of the box.No carrier bloatware, clean LG interface. Smooth, quick response time, sharp looking screen with nice colors and contrast.Build date noted as 4/2016, so Amazon is not selling old phones (purchased directly from Amazon.com, not a 3rd party seller). I am aware of the boot loop issue, but given these are current builds, I am confident the newer manufacturing line is fine, however, I will update this review if I do run into any issues.I also have a Samsung Note5 (work phone), which is a technically superior unit, so it should blow this away, right? Wrong. Real-world speed with everyday tasks (internet, email, etc.) is effectively the same (the Note5 is a few ms faster launching most apps), however, surprisingly, the G4 is able to easily toggle back and forth between various open apps; the Note5 seems to do this a bit slower. Oddly, with no other apps open, the G4 performs much better with Google Chrome and Java than the Note5. If your primary use is the internet, then the G4 is the hands-down winner.Although very capable, the G4 is a step slower than the Note5 when used for 3D gaming. Since I don't really play games that much, it's not really an issue for me, and again, the G4 is more than capable, it just doesn't have the same fluidity the Note5 has in this department.Is the Note5 superior to the G4? In strict technological terms, yes. However, the LG G4 has less custom ""bloatware"" from LG than the Note5 has from Samsung, and as a result, real-world performance (sans 3D games) is nearly identical. Couple that with the fact the Note5 is going for nearly double the price of the G4, it seems unfathomable to spend $250+ more to get the Note5 for a few more FPS and that snazzy pen (unless you really NEED the pen).ALSO, if you are into sound, the Note5 does NOT have APTX (verified with CSR), while the G4 most certainly does!",30,5
LG,"The Internet stopped working the first day. Doesn't look to me like an original lg phone...,looks fake!I don't think an original LG phone made in Korea shows 'just a Sec' like this one.",28,1
LG,"I also bought one that was rejected by Verizon, in spite of what the advertisement says.",25,1
LG,"I bought from seller Amazon.com. Came in brand new. Unlocked, works well with ATT. Just put the sim card and phone runs smoothly. Software is the latest Android marshmallow already. For the price of $299, you can't go wrong.",12,5
LG,"I believe this phone has different models stocked at different Amazon fulfillment centers. I searched tirelessly to ensure that the phone I bought would be 100% compatible with AT&T, but upon receiving the phone and taking it to AT&T I was informed that the phone I purchased (model US991) is a CDMA phone and is not capable of 4G LTE speeds on AT&T's network. The representative at the AT&T store worked for 45 minutes to try to program the phone to work properly but it will not. I spoke with Amazon customer service and they sent a second phone but it was still model US991. From seeing other people's reviews, I think if I lived closer to a different fulfillment center, the phone would have been a GSM phone instead of the CDMA phone I received both times.The phone itself is incredible. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday (his previous smartphone predated our four year relationship) and was honestly hoping he would dislike it so I could take it off his hands. If the LG G5 is as good a phone as this one is, I think I'll be switching back to Android from iPhone.",23,4
LG,"If you are planning to use it with Verizon network then walk away from this phone, You will not be able to talk on the phone and browse the web at the same time, unless you are connected to wi fi, and to return it you will need to pay for shippng it back.",13,1
LG,"I will be returning this. Despite what the listing says, it doesn't work on Verizon's network. You need to buy a Verizon-specific phone for that.",19,1
LG,"It has a best display ever, cool fast system and the camera works perfect. Except the phone i receive have a Big Pink Circle in Video recording, such annoyance when you are taking a video with indoor light. And it doesn't have a last long battery. i have to charge it twice a day",19,3
LG,"This phone has just broken down in less than a week. I can't believe it !!!! I have this green screen huge line, it's horrible but I will have faith in ""Amazon ""these people are the best some of these manufactures a little sheisty I think but the phone....died, so horrible' horrible moments I'm about to cry guys, be careful out there that's all I can say.....

LG,"I Loved this phone! I bought in Feb then in June it keep turning on and off?? We did a search on this problem and found out that it was a manufacturing defect that LG had known about since October of the year before. After talking to LG they admitted it was their fault and I could send in my phone for repair, BUT it would not come back unlocked! I would have to call US cellular and use them as a carrier for an unknown amount of time to get the code to unlock?? I have never even heard of them and I didnt want to change carries! Needless to say I was upset! But when I contacted Amazon with this problem they got a hold of BREED. They agreed to refund me for the phone! Now I want to emphasize This was a manufacturing defect! Not Breeds or Amazon's fault, but they both stepped up and gave me a full refund for my phone! I will never buy a LG product again, but I would not hesitate to buy from Breed or Amazon! They have GREAT costumer service! Thank you Breed for the refund I can now get a new phone!",14,2
LG,Beautiful pictures. Great phone. Speakers are loud enough for me and graphics great. It came in quickly and is metro pcs compatible. There was an issue with the IMEI the box and phone had different ones and the one on the phone was shorter but all that had to be done was call metro pcs Customer service. They have the metro pcs agent a code to punch into the phone which have her the phone's entire of IMEI on the phone. Happy with my purchase,14,5
LG,"This model is not the H815 (international version) and they don't say it, it's actually the US Cellular version. They say that it works with any international carrier and it did work at first but then I upgraded to marshmallow via notification and it stopped receiving mobile data, it was not unlocked anymore. I had to return it and ask for a refund. Save yourselves the trouble if for you intend to use it outside the US and don't buy it.",15,1
LG,Sickest phone on the market. F Samsung!,10,5
LG,I was very concerned about this device seeing all those negative reviews i am not a first timer in line of specs and perfomance of smartphones everbody is samsung i had all which i am use to but i decided i want something new . and i went for it and boy did this phone exseed my expectations the phone is great battery life good carried me almost two days with moderate use i am happy that i took the chance i have 860 model dual sim the memory card slot is also served as a second sim so you have the option either use a sd card or another sim. So in shorter terms this phone is fantastic i love myself this was an honest review done on my behalf,10,5
LG,"It has 512MB RAM... Not have snapdragon processor. It have MTK processor. You can buy a phone that have at least 1GB RAM cost 50$... Also there is a big scratch on sim card slot even I didn't put my sim card in it when I see it. Screen resolution is awful...! And I bought a case before it delivered. It doesn't fit the phone. It is a big phone. And Battery is also can not removable. And it is 1000mAh ! And I started the return/refund this order, When he approve and send the return label to me after that I will change my one star review. I put the pics of it, you can see clearly.I am very upset... :(",10,1
LG,"I love my phone, no complaints. Pictures it takes are just wonderful would not trade for anything",31,5
LG,"Been using this a few days and so far so good. Much cheaper than the US model, comes in more colors, and works great on Tmobile. This is a GSM-only version. Dual SIM is a bonus I'll probably take advantage of when I travel. I know there are some reports of manufacturing issues, particularly with the US variants, but the phone I received seems to be perfect, with all components lining up, no warping, and no software issues. Came with all accessories new and in working order. If you love taking photos, THIS is the Android phone for you. This phone also looks and feels a lot better in hand than the press pictures.",23,5

LG,"I have owned a Black 16GB Nexus 5 since they first came out and have loved it ever since. I wanted to upgrade my wife's phone so I decided to jump on this great deal.I was amazed that this phone came in looking and working brand new. I could not even tell it was a refurbished unit! I ordered the White 32GB model and compared to my Black 16GB one, it looks really nice! There were NO blemishes on the product at all. I slapped on a?ÿTech21 Protective Nexus 5 Case Impact Frame - Black?ÿand with the contrasting White back, it looks very nice.The reason why I got another Nexus 5 two years later, is that they are fantastic phones and are the perfect size. Sure there are better phones out there, but nothing beats the experience of pure Android. I am running 6.0.1 and the camera has improved yet again, and the battery life lasts a lot longer than when this phone was first released. I also have an LG G4, and while that is a much nicer phone overall with a better display and one of the best cameras, this Nexus 5 was less than half the price. Cannot beat that value!",11,5
LG,"My refurbished Nexus 5 arrived in new condition and worked perfectly. It comes in a generic box with a 3rd party charger and no documentation or manuals. Please note that a SIM card removal tool was not included in the kit. Every new Nexus phone comes with a tool which can be used to eject the sim card but this refurbished phone does not come with the ejection tool. However, something like a paper clip will work just as good as the official tool. I thoroughly tested all aspects of the Nexus 5's operation including cellular, WIFI, text messaging, MMS messaging, and everything was in perfect working condition. The overall phone was in like new condition with no noticeable signs of wear and tear. The screen was scratch free and looked new. I think it's an awesome deal for the money. This item was ordered from BuySPRY. I highly recommend this item.Update: I recently ordered a 2nd refurbished Nexus 5 from BREED. I didn't intend to switch vendors but when I reordered the item, Amazon chose BREED instead of the vendor I purchased my first Nexus 5 from as described above. This time the phone arrived in an official looking LG box which contained a white Nexus 5, a 3rd party charger, and no SIM ejection tool. The phone was in new condition just like the one I received from BuySPRY, and powered up and worked fine. However, since I ordered a black phone and received a white one, I returned it to BREED and ordered a new one from BuySPRY. BuySPRY sent me another Nexus 5 in perfect working condition. The phone was in new condition, and powered up and ran great. I upgraded the software to Android Marshmallow and my daughter has been using it for a week now with no issues.In summary, I received a total of 3 refurbished phones (I kept 2 and returned 1) and they all worked great and were received in like new condition. I'm also pretty sure Amazon.com is fulfilling the orders for both BREED and BuySPRY so I don't think it was the vendor's fault I received the wrong color phone. I wouldn't hesitate to place an order with either vendor in the future.I am did not receive any compensation or discounts for this review. I have absolutely no affiliation with the vendors or with Amazon.com. I'm just an average Joe who loves Nexus phones!",34,5
LG,"Got this to replace my smashed original Nexus 5. Great deal for this phone. Phone looks great, don't see any blemishes. Note that it comes with the original 4.x software version so you'll spend time waiting for the new versions to download and install. Also, if you have your old phone data in Google backup, I suggest disabling backup/restore and waiting on 5.x/Lollipop to download to install before turning it back on. It doesn't come with the original charger but the a folding wall charger. Charger works fine but i use wireless charging anyway.Con: Had the common issue of wireless charging not working. Just use your thumbs and press down on the back of the case right above the ""s"" in Nexus. You should hear a click and the wireless will then work.",25,5
LG,"Don't Buy! I LOVE the nexus 5. I've owned one ever since its release. I gave my last one to my mom so I wanted a new one. This wasn't the one to buy. 1. it looks very used. Even though they say Refurbished it's just used and old. and 2. It had hardware issues. Booting the phone would take many minutes. It would also not respond to touches on the screen right out of the box. Didn't even last a day in my house. Returned it. I'm going to get another N5 because I love this phone, but no refurb for me moving forward.",21,1
LG,"I bought this phone from Amazon in October 2014 and not using until mid Jan 2015. It worked fine for a couple of days and then suddenly it stopped and not getting powered on in spite of charging so many hours. Amazon, Google and LG people are not ready to repair, replace or refund the money. Amazon keep telling the same in spite of filing a claim that this item doesn't fall under A-Z claim since 30 days is over. I am not asking for return of my item. The phone should have 1 year warranty and neither seller is helping in getting repaired. LG is telling that this phone is manufactured outside US and can't be repaired in US since no internation warranty. I bought this phone in US and asking to repair in US itself but nobody is helping so i would stronly suggest not to buy google phone from this seller. The hardware manufacturer or seller should help in getting repaired when it's under warranty of 1 year otherwise no use of warranty. It's just 2 months.Please don't buy this phone from Amazon. Nobody helped me in getting replaced or repaired and i lost all money.",10,1
LG,"The device shipped quickly and arrived fine. However, *nowhere* on this item's title or descriptions is mentioned by the seller that this is the INTERNATIONAL VERSION of the phone. After using it for one day, and not getting any of my text messages, as well as being unable to call even though I could access the mobile data network with my old SIM, I contacted my carrier. As my carrier explained and you can read online in various locations, it is very likely the cell bands for LTE or 4G will not be covered by North American carriers. My carrier was also perplexed how I could even access the mobile data network without being able to make phone calls/text and having Wifi disabled. Again, my only complaint is that NOWHERE is it explicitly stated on this item's page that it may not work properly in North America under North American carriers, or bother to use the words International Version.IF YOU ARE A NORTH AMERICAN MOBILE PHONE CARRIER SUBSCRIBER, YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS PHONE UNLESS YOU CHECK WHAT BANDS YOUR SERVICE PROVIDER USES. EVEN THEN, THE BANDS VARY WILDLY IN LOCATIONS THAT THEY ARE OFFERED, SO YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE IT AT ALL.",55,1
LG,"I'm deeply sorry to inform that i received the wrong version. This cell phone was supposed to be D821 version, which is compatible with the 4G technology frequency in Brazil. But the version of the phone i received was D820.Too bad.",51,1
LG,"Dont buy it!! I needed a d821 to use 4g in Brazil, but when arrived at my hotel, it was d820!!! Now im going back to Brazil with the wrong phone!",48,1
LG,"Love the phone. Simple, elegant and powerful. At half the price of an iPhone it's a great alternative and a good way of getting into our android without the bloat. No replaceable battery or memory add on makes for a compact phone. Try it still has a decent screen size and your virtually guaranteed the latest updates when they arrive. I picked up the international version and I'm using AT&T when in the US. I can only access 3G/HSPA but that's plenty quick for me and when I'm in Europe I get all the frequencies. Sweet handset, awesome price!",26,5

LG,These phone are not new. They are refurbished. Anyone can see easily that the phone box has been opened and than resealed again with white tape.,11,1
LG,"Pros:Great screen (quality and size)Great cameraFast chargingLow costNexus device (fast updates)Fingerprint scanner (works extremely well)Usable battery lifeCons:Only 2GB of ramUSB type c is not very common thus borrowing a charger is almost impossible without carrying an adapterThis is a great budget phone, I bought it at 270 dollars to replace my nexus 4 (screen broke and touch stopped working). I love nexus devices but they used to have sub par cameras, not anymore. the camera is great for taking pictures and selfies, especially in low light. I sometimes wish it had 3 or 4gb of ram since it cant keep instagram, snapchat, whatsapp, and facebook loaded at the same time, making multitasking sluggish at times. Other than that the battery could be better but the fast charging more than makes up for it. For this price its hard to go wrong with a nexus 5X, If my old nexus devices are any guidance this phone should last so long that you forget other phones exist.The two pictures included were taken indoors with low lighting and without flash.",11,5
LG,"I noticed that it has just 10GB of storage, it should be 16GB. Because of that I have to backup images ande videos constantly, and always getting out of space for install more apps and I have not too many. Also some times the phone freeze and heat up, is very annoying.",54,1
LG,"The phone itself is wonderful. My two star review is based on the abysmal customer service that LG provides.Two weeks after receiving my phone, the headphone jack stopped working. This is a simple fix, only requiring the back cover be removed and the jack swapped out. I contacted LG and asked them to perform only this repair since I got lucky with a phone that worked well and to please not remove my glass screen protector that had been on for just one week.Here's what their repair department did:- They removed my screen protector- They then scratched my screen- They damaged the headphone port on the body of the phone (see below)- They dented the back of the case (looked like someone jammed a tool into the jack to pry the back of the case off)- They replaced the mainboard, stating that the phone was shutting itself off - something it had never doneThis wasn't surprising to me. Two years ago I sent a phone in for dust under the front camera after having it a month. They damaged that phone even more.I've called and emailed LG asking them to send me a new back cover. Their customer service is set up so that you can only be escalated once and those supervisors cannot do anything but offer to have you send your phone back to the place that damaged it in the first place. Contacting via email causes you to hit the same wall, where no one can actually do anything to help. This customer service is appalling.Beware of LG.",50,2
LG,"Google nailed tailed this one. Expectations where high in light of the popular Nexus 5 and they delivered. I'm not going to give you a multi-page analysis on the gritty details - for that you can go read a professional write up. What I am going to do is give a run-down of what makes the Nexus 5X so awesome, and then in light of that, what few aspects of it may be looked at as cons for some. -First off the Nexus 5X runs Marshmallow (6.0)- the newest android OS with effortless fluidity and precision. -The 12.3 megapixel camera (no, megapixels are not the only thing you judge a camera by) is the best camera on any phone (yes that includes any current iPhone), besides the Galaxy S6 and Note5. It is particularly impressive in low-light settings with its larger 1.55 ?æm pixels. -The fingerprint sensor on the back is not only innovative, but completely practical and insanely fast, as well as being totally glitch proof. It works every time. It also provides just a cool sense of security in your hand- you have a point of reference for your finger in the back. -The 5.2 inch full HD display is perfect. Just the right size to use in one hand and still appreciate the beautiful HD experience. -Since it is a Google-made phone, you get any and all updates automatically and right away. -The phone will charges from dead 0 to 100% in half an hour. -The fully universal and reversible C-port charging cable puts Apple's ""lighting charger"" to absolute shame, and will soon take over the market. -The body of the phone is polycarbonate (but not cheap-feeling) material instead of metal, making it more flexible and less likely to break if dropped. -Google Now - The new Google search system built into the home button is incredibly useful. It also lets you activate a voice search with the words ""Ok Google"", even when you phone is off. -Double-tapping the power button will bring up the camera speedily. -Last but of course not least: the sub-400$ price-tag. -Oh, and the jade ""Ice"" color is really cool in my opinion.Possible cons: -The C-port charging cable is not USB compatible without a converter- so you can't charge it from most computers. This problem is simply fixed by just remembering to carry around your charger. C-port capability is also a thing of the future. It's only a matter of time before it completely takes over the place of the bulky and frustrating USB ports. -The non-poshness of ""plastic"" body. Apple enthusiasts users will make a big deal about this, even while they walk around with their shattered, BUT METAL iPhones. -No wireless charging capabilities. Would this be nice? Sure. But I'm not complaining when I can charge my phone in less than 30 minutes.Only real con: -2 GB of RAM. This is a small amount, and with no up-gradable options this is true negative and frustrating aspect. Yet if you get the 32 GB version (which I would recommend, the price jump isn't too much), you probably wont be too bothered by this unless you're an app-crazed and download fanatic.CONCLUSION:Google produced a killer new phone of the future with the fingerprint sensor, high-quality camera, and C-port charging features. The best part: It's a fraction of the price of expensive flagships like the iPhone 6 (Plus), or the Galaxy S6 or Note5. You wont regret picking up a sleek new Google Nexus 5X.",39,5
LG,"So I've had lots and lots of unlocked phones with Cricket's service over the years, and I have noticed a few common themes among them all. Unlocked phones tend to be cheaply made and for the most part are hit or miss out of the box.. BUT, this phone beats the competition out of the water by a mile and a half. I've only had this phone for about two months as of me writing this review, but this is the single most amazing phone I've ever had! I'm telling you now, if you have the money to invest into this phone, even if it's financed with something like Amazon Credit, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.My favorite feature though, is the camera. The display is not only 1080p, but the camera can shoot 4K images..! Just, unbelievable. Here's a few photos to show you what you're getting for your money!",19,5
LG,"This K10 is the international version from an Argentinian manufacture. Since it was made there, it uses the old 3g and not the new 4g signal meaning setting it up with a U.S. based carrier will not let you use the high speed band. If you don't use that much data or just use is as a second phone it is ok mid range phone. Specks arn't great but it will get the job done. Do not get this for your daily if data is an issue.",12,3
LG,"So I needed a Cheap Phone because I iPhone bit the dust.$700 for a new phone really seems crazy to me. I sit at a computer all day, and $700 dollars can go a super far way.Well the LG lancet is only 43 dollars on Amazon. I decided to try it out. - I love it.Windows 8.1 on mobile is great. -It has a mini sd slot,- I can make the phone have a black background.- it syncs with outlook and one drive stuff great.- Has snes and GBA emulators, -It has enough apps to keep me happy, I am not a heavy smart phone user.Cons-Not a great camera- cant access amazon services.Overall I am super happy with the phone. Check it out. It's 40 DOLLARS. SAVE THAT MONEY IF YOU DON""T NEED THE BEST SMART PHONE!",13,5
LG,"Overall happy, only frustration with the phone is that it periodically loses the connection with the sd card and garbles the current set of pictures. Battery life is excellent, and plenty of space for apps",10,4
LG,"This phone was my first smart phone, and every time I smash mine, drop it in boiling water, or urinate on it by accident, I buy this phone again. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it does everything a smart phone should.It is a great phone that came shipped perfectly, no flaws, had a charger and manuals. I bought a Trident case for it, and it is amazing, I have reviewed that as well.I have used this phone for years. It messages, calls, is lightning fast on the internet, and doesn't have any OS issues. It is durable, and will withstand the daily tumble and minor spills. Does not do well in the dishwasher...Buy this phone for sure. It is a inexpensive simple phone that does all that most people will need. For the price, it is the best deal I have found.",14,5
LG,"Purchased this phone for my wife and I have been finding excuses to use it whenever I can, Bought this for less than $65 and I must say this may be the best deal I have ever gotten from Amazon.",10,5
LG,This is a wonderful phone to use! I had no idea what I was missing compared to my older model smartphone. The touch sensitivity of the screen is excellent and it's very intuitive to use.,11,5
LG,"My son broke his Neon with over a year before he was eligible for replacement. Looking to replace without costing an arm and a leg I came across this phone. The phone was priced well and came quickly. We took his old SIM card out of broken phone, placed it in this phone and it was up and running immediately. I would buy this product again.",45,5
LG,Easy to use and very durable. I have two kids and so juggling things in my arms and hands is a concern. This phone has survived a few drops already.,14,5
LG,"I have read a bunch of bad reviews of this phone and consequently was very reluctant to buy it, but the large number of features and reasonable price made me take a chance on it. I did not regret buying this phone at all.Pros:- Slide out texting keyboard works great- mp3 and media player works fine(it supposedly plays mp4 video files as well, I have not tried that)- microSD slot, although only supports up to 4GB- Bluetooth, but not for file transfers which limits it a bit- Decent camera- Pretty good utilities and contact list app- Even has a document viewer for pdf's doc's and the like.Cons:- Short battery life (I manage 2-4 days before recharging)- Gives no low battery warning, when the battery runs out it just turns off- Included java games and apps are trialware and uselessI have had no problems with phone functionality, or freezes, or any other problems frequently mentioned. Maybe more recent firmware versions fixed the teething problems of this phone that earlier users experienced. It does have a small lag doing certain things, but you cannot expect supercomputing speeds from a budget phone. All in all a great, flexible, fun little device.",18,4
LG,"When I received this phone I couldn't believe it! Instead of the normal ""clear plastic sticker""on the glass front that you just pull off, this phone had a paper sticker glued on the front!! I tried to peel it off but it wouldn't come off without serious work which of course just scratched up the glass display. I never bothered to try the phone at that point since the display was already messed up with glue, paper and scratches. I would NEVER purchase from this seller again. Returned for refund - as always Amazon Customer Service was great!",18,1
LG,"Does NOT require a data plan which is what we needed. Good phone for simply calls and a full keyboard for texting. Haven't used a lot of the other features yet so cannot comment on camera, MP3, etc. It was pretty much plug and play when we got it a dropped the sim card in. We were off and running in no time at all.",17,4
LG,"I use this as a GoPhone, for emergency calls and texting. The call sound quality is disputable, but the QWERTY keyboard makes it easy to use. The only thing I really dislike is the message alert, which allows only one alert or an alert every 2 minutes. I was used to an alert initially, then a simple beep every 5 mins thereafter. BUT this is the 2nd Neon I have, after the down key on the 1st stopped working properly, so am happy enough with it for my purposes.",15,4
LG,Phone works like a charm. Great buy for the money. This phone is way better than what I was expecting.,16,5
LG,"Item says 32gb, but I was sent a 16gb phone.",10,1
LG,"Ugh, this thing overheats. I'm not sure if it was just mine but it would get so hot with ordinary use that I couldn't hold it in my hand, and what's even worse if I used it while it was charging it would get so hot it would shut down. I returned it and bought a Galaxy S6. I would have liked to stay on project fi, it's just too bad they only allow you to use the service with this or the Nexus 6s.",10,1
LG,"Pretty snazzy device... Wished it had removable storage and a bit more ram, but outside of that I love the weight and the camera is down right awesome (checkout the low-light photo I attached from a party in Port Royal, Jamaica) ... Good value for money Google.",10,4
LG,"My three month old Moto X Pure was stolen, so I bought this one instead. This review will center around comparing the two, as they are in very similar price points. I prefer this phone to the Motorola, by a slight margin.The pros:- The size is smaller, which makes it easier to manipulate. It still is a big phone, bigger than a Moto G- It is much lighter. The difference is significant when in the pocket- Fingerprint scanner is very practical and useful to unlock the device. I thought it would be a gimmick, but it is not- The screen is brighter and has better color calibration- The main camera takes better pictures- The screen is high resolution enough (HD) while not waisting battery or processing power in pushing pixels I can't see (QHD)- Slightly faster, even though it has 1 GB less of RAM. I installed all updates right away, which may explain why I'm not seeing the performance bottlenecks some other reviewers are talking about.- Faster software updates- Easier to repair (not much glue to hold it together)The cons:- The selfie camera doesn't have as wideangle a lens as on the Moto X- No one I know has a USB C charger. Make sure you have enough battery when you leave your house!- The plastic construction has very slight creaking sounds when handling it sometimes, which is annoying (reminds me of Nokia dumbphones of yore, not that they were not durable). The Motorola felt like a solid brick. This is explained by the fact that the Motorola is glued together, while this one has a more traditional construction.- The Moto X has an SD card slot and Android 6.0's adoptable storage makes it seem like internal memory to the user, which is great. You're stuck with what you bought with the Nexus.The same:- Battery life is just as bad on this as it is on the Moto X (or any other 2015 phone). I miss my old Moto G's amazing battery life- Fast charging is just as fast and convenient on both- Network reception, call quality and modem speed seem on par",10,5
LG,"I recently purchased an iPhone 6s Plus after having an iPhone 6 for nearly a year, and I just didn't like iOS anymore. I've been using iPhones since the iPhone 3GS days, and iOS doesn't really feel like it's changed. I have tried Android several times over the years, but decided to go 100% in this time. I purchased the Nexus 5X because I liked the smaller footprint, and I liked that it came straight from Google. The phone has been a fantastic upgrade so far. The OS is snappy, the device is well built, feels great in the hand, and is quite light. USB-C is great, and the fact that it's reversible is the best part. When I would use Android after using my iPhone, the biggest thing I missed was the reversible Lightning connector. The screen looks great as well, being very vibrant and bright. Touch screen responsiveness is also very precise, and the Nexus Imprint sensor is crazy fast. I thought the Touch ID sensor on my 6s Plus was fast, but this is even faster. I barely have to set my finger on the sensor for the phone to unlock. As a whole, the phone brings one of the best experiences available to the cell phone market (and at a low cost!) I have no problem recommending this device to anyone in the market for a new phone.",11,5

LG,"I received this smartphone in excellent condition. I extensively reviewed it in various serious GSM smartphone review sites. It needed to have 850MHz band, Wifi and GPS. So, this one had all of it and more. I received it in a retail box, not a brown carton like some others, which was fine. Once opened, surprise! The only mini manual is in Chinese language. I had to go to the LG website from Australia to get the manual in English! I charge it and waited. Put it in my mini-sim card and started it. Surprise! It started in Chinese! No English counter part, all Chinese scriptures! I had to figure through some trials and errors to put in in English! So the Australian manual helped quite a bit. Finally I got it started, recognized my cell service provider, OK, so far so good. When one reviews the apps one finds besides what was expected, another surprise! Lots of Chinese apps which meant nothing to me, except most were for gambling online! I had to go on Settings and erase all of that junk from my phone. It is now clean, with my data service, and rid of all those junk gambling apps, I hope. I easily loaded apps from Google Play, such as SkyMaps (Maps was included), and other apps I need for my work and hobbies. So, it's OK. Here the same phone with contract goes for $300, so I am satisfied with my LG. I have an older LG, the GT540, which still works fine. For the price and the capacity it is a fine purchase, but please, the seller must include an English manual-user guide and set the phone in English or multilanguage, customers will appreciate that.",82,3
LG,"Excellent phone as fast and light, its performance is very similar to the Samsung Galaxy advance and is cheaper, I recommend",35,5
LG,"When my Samsung Galaxy s3 got stolen and I wouldnƒ??t spend that much money in a phone again so I went with this option and I am very satisfied. Is a wonderful phone, is fast and has a good style (and I am comparing it to the Galaxy s3) the camera isnƒ??t the best but its pretty good at the end. The thing is: its a great phone for the price you pay!",31,4
LG,"General:Comes shipped for another language but that's to be expected as the P705 was intended for the Chinese market, works 100% on T-Mobile so far - Look to your carrier's website to see how to program your phone to connect to their data/MMS services, else it will not work, you must tell it where to connect - It is not a fault in the phone.Design:The phone is flat and square which is good because it slips in your pocket comfortably, the back isn't as 'grippy' as it seems it might be - A case or replacement back may solve this (I am used to the back of my Google Nexus 7 with it's less-than-plastic backing).The buttons don't sit out too far; just enough to identify and press when needed. The battery back is a little difficult to remove without a tool or fingernails as it does not slide off, rather than snapping on. This becomes a problem when needing to access the microSD slot which for some people may be often (Stock Android connects to your computer via MTP or Media Transfer Protocol which means it doesn't allow the same ease of use as say a thumb drive and in the case of Windows 7 makes you confirm every file you copy over that it might not work on your device. There is also software you may download from LG for the device to transfer and backup data.)Specs, performance:The battery is as robust as to be expected, using apps, texting and such, I find I really only need to charge every other day, but this is no problem since I rarely find myself lost in the wilderness for a week.Actual battery life varies per user and the things running and connecting of course. A user smart with their battery would see days on standby, surprisingly as much as I personally turn on to mess around with the screen on, (Brightness at 28%, still very clear. The screen can get VERY bright.) the screen is the fourth on the list of things that pull power to my battery. The top items on my phone: Cell Standby, Android System, Phone Idle and finally the Screen. In the other devices I have used (Primarily tablets), the screen is usually the top pulling item, by grand leaps. This isn't the case with the P705, the screen is rather easy on battery life.Power-wise, as noted, my other Android device is a Nexus 7 so I feel it's apples and oranges, however the P705 holds its own against it, very few lags and no hang-ups, though I mind to restart my phone every couple days to clear out and let it start fresh. Installing Nova Launcher on as my default home, it performs with minimal lag, though I notice a slight stutter on screen transitions (Primarily the ""Swinging door"" transition.) The default launcher performed well, however, an LG customized ICS launcher. Nothing too spectacular, hence the upgrade to Nova Launcher. Runs most apps without issue, have not tested many games outside of Osmos, which proved to make the game stutter - It's definitely not a gaming phone.Depending on your carrier, connection will always vary, however the P705 gets rather good connection that I have found so far, on average, I get better reception than I did with most of my previous phones. WiFi isn't terrible, i don't lose signal nor find that I get better performance than my Nexus, either.The speaker isn't terribly loud but it would work well enough to carry out a speakerphone conversation as well as you won't miss a call due to not hearing it.",23,5
LG,"Many users have said that this phone does not work with Mobile data networks(3G and 2G). It's absolutely true.I ordered the phone and ignored other comments that this phone does not connect 3G and 2G networks and ended up losing$10 to ship the phone back. I tried the sim cards from AT&T and T-Mobile and none of them worked. Only voice worked. I do believe that the sellers are well aware of this problem but they will sell you the phone hopping that people will accept the phone as is.Conclusion, this is what you get when you try to go cheap. You will end up wasting your time and in my case losing money.Spend an additional $100 or $150 and you will be happy. For example, the Nexus 4 costs $300 or the iPhone 4 costs $450 which comes unlocked. You can buy the iPhone 4 unlocked directly from the Apple web site.",21,1
LG,"Very good product. The only problem is that it comes configured in korean or something like that. But you can change the language, although you be little apprehensive while you're doind that. Everything else was just fine.",14,4

LG,"Excellent phone once you root it and uninstall all AT&T crap!!!! (of course if you will not use it in AT&T network)... Otherwise the ROM of at&t will make you life miserable... For example each time you open your contacts, it opens the ""AT&T Address book"" instead your normal android address book. You need to tap back button each time to go to android address book.... this is really annoying!! and of course this can't be uninstalled unless you root the phone and use a third party uninstaller.Other fatal issue I found in this phone is that is impossible to enable the wifi hotspot, Wifi tethering. (Of course in different networks that AT&T)... I tried to enable tethering fuction in normal way (settings>tethering & networks>Mobile Hotspot), and with several apps for this purpose (almost 15) and was absolutly impossible in each and all these ways... Also I tried with several carriers (diffent sims), and the same problem...Thats all so far. Sorry for my english!",10,3

I had seen a lot of reviews on here saying that the 4G did not work in the US, so I did a little research and found out that there is 3 models of this phone. There is the E970(AT&T version) and there is the LS970(Sprint Version) and i believe there is also an E975(International Version). So, for those of you who are giving this phone a low review because the 4G does not work in the US, make sure you have the unlocked AT&T version and not the International Version(E975). The E970(AT&T) has a MicroSD card slot up to 64Gb, 16Gb ROM and it comes with a 16Gb MicroSD card for a total of 32Gb but you can use about 25Gb more or less in total, which I think is enough for everyone. Before you buy, you can always contact the seller and ask to make sure you are getting what you want/need that way you do not spend your money. I would not be able to tell you if the AT&T version (E970) would work anywhere else in the world, the best thing to do would be to research really good before you buy it. Another way to tell the E970(AT&T version) apart from the Sprint(LS970) and International version(E975) is by the camera. Both the Sprint and International version have a 13MP camera and does NOT have a MicroSD card slot, they just have a 32Gb ROM (memory for storage). AT&T decided to go with the 8MP camera instead of 13MP but added the MicroSD card slot, which is much better in my opinion. Other than that I believe the phones have the same specs.Specifications:-Quad-core 1.5GHz Processor-Adreno 320 GPU(for Graphics)-2Gb RAM-8MP Camera, 1.3MP front Facing camera-Android 4.1.2(came installed already)-MicroSD card slot up to 64Gb, 16Gb MicroSD card included.-Micro SIM-2G, 3G, and 4G(Where available, check your desired carrier)-4.7"" True HD IPS+ Display(very nice and clear!)-Gorilla Glass 2-2100 mAh battery(non-removeable)I think this is everything for right now, I will try and update as time goes by. If you guys have any questions feel free to ask I will try and reply ASAP. Thank you for taking your time to read this, it only helps you anyway :pALL SPECIFICATIONS INFORMATION WAS TAKEN FROM gsmarena dot comUPDATE: I've had this phone for about 2 or 3 weeks and it is working great! the battery has a good life with light to moderate use. I am writing this on my phone, the last time I charged it was Saturday night and it still has 30% battery life left. I made a couple of phone calls, text messages, some social networks,picture messaging, and web browsing.one thing that I had an issue with as the messaging app. for some weird reason, my messaging app got deleted and just disappeared. I had to do a factory reset to get it back. good thing is that I had installed an app that backed up my apps, but not data because my phone is not rooted. But overall the phone is working great, if you're looking for a case with not much bulk look for the diztronic matte black case.",65,5
LG,"I am reviewing the seller because of his lack of info, not the cell phone. The problem here is that this model only operates with this frequencies:850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900/ 2100/ 2600 (phone box says, indeed, this phone is designed to work on all european countries ?ª?ª)You must contact your service provider and ask for the frequencies they use, otherwise you could have something like a Ducati running at 10 k/h.I had to subscribe to another provider in order to use the 3G speed. Please make sure the frequencies above works with your provider.",11,3
LG,is a great phone at a low price they recommend in Venezuela only serves 3g and 4g for digitel no for movistar,30,5
LG,"Phone is brand new, unlocked ,2GB Ram and 32gb memory,camera 13mp,made in korean I love it,But battery is short.Cheap and better than Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300.Thank you",12,5
LG,This is a great phone. Excellent build quality!But beware! you can't use the 4G LTE since this phone does not support 4G LTE service in North America.,22,5
LG,"Wow It is great! It is so fast, work perfectly. In Venezuela you need configure the internet acces point or go to your prefered operator . If you have Movistar in Venezuela you can configure the internet: Go to (ajustes, redes y conexiones,redes m??viles, Nombres de puntos de acceso: Nombre movistar WAP APN wap.movistar.ve Proxy 200.35.64.73 Puerto 9001 MCC 734 MNC 04 Tipo de APN default). With movistar work perfectly. Quad-core amazing and 2Gb RAM made this phone better than phone of 500$. This I received is E970, there are people that buy the E975 and it have a different camera of 13 Mp without expandible memory. E970 has a camera of 8 Mp and expandible memory. The meaning point is that sometimes you need to configure the APN in order to enjoy internet, if you doesn't do the APN configuration you will think that the phone doesn't work 3G. I recommend you see other phone that works with your prefered operator and copy the APN information and your phone, will work perfectly in 3G or 4G.",22,5
LG,"Its a brand new phone with high configuration, in generic packaging. Includes 16GB microSD card & updated firmware to Jelly Bean 4.1.2 :-). What more you need!!!? & I paid $187 for it (on 29 Jan, 2014). BUT, I received this phone today (10th Feb)!!! Shipping was terrible. It supposed to be delivered on 6th Feb, but... :-|. I was very angry!!! but when I opened the box... wow! it was an awesome experience!!! I definitely recommend this phone!!!Update (24 Feb, 2014): Still flawless performance after 24 days of power usage. You just can not ask anything more on 'performance' department. I could not utilize 2GB RAM, it is more than enough. Quad core CPU is super fast. I see many users complaining about battery life. Well 2100mAH is not enough for a android device like Optimus G to run 24 hours on moderate use. However, you can get that much of battery life by turning on 'Eco Mode' from setting menu. And about camera performance, it is doing pretty well. Images are fairly sharp enough, though the front facing camera is not that sharp. But you have to consider its price. In this price, this phone is the best phone ever!!! I still, highly recommend this phone.Update (06 Oct, 2014): Bought another one for my sister. She is very happy with this phone. An EXCELLENT piece of hardware, released on December, 2012! Don't even think about the performance, its superb because of a very capable Qualcomm CPU with Adreno 320 GPU, coupled with 2GB of RAM, which still a standard amount of RAM. Only grape is the battery life. Its average. I'm rocking android version 4.4.4 (CyanogenMod 11). So, I'm getting the latest version of android through Cyanogen (they are still supporting the device), and my hardware is good too. What else I need?",17,5
LG,"I bought this phone from Soles etc fulfill by Amazon.Com. Please note that this review is about the seller; not the phone.This phone was supposed to be brand new, however it was used. It has scratches on the lower left corner of the screen. On the back it has scratches on the upper right corner as well as around the lens of the back camera along with some dirt around it.The cover plastic on the back has dirt around the edges, like if somebody has been using the phone for awhile. Which to me was the case. Also a new phone has plastic all around it, this phone has none. The phone arrived ready to be used, which mean; all I had to do was insert my Sim Card and it was ready to make a phone call. There was no setup up time which is normal on a new phone; Which also suggest that the phone had been used.Remember before you use a new phone there are a few steps to follow, depending on how you answer your first question; At least on an AT&T phone is that way.I'd emailed Soles etc about this issue, to give them a chance to fix it. This was their reply:""I am so sorry to hear this, we purchase in high-volume. sometimes phoned slip through that are damaged! you are welcome to return the phone to Amazon and can get a full refund. thank you""I'd paid US$449.00 for this phone, now a phone like the one that I've received is about US$ 255.00, almost US$200.00 difference for that and a quote ""Slip Through"". I don't think a seller should make a mistake that would cost its customers that amount of money. Plus all the time that you have to spend to return the item, get your money back and be able to buy another phone. It took me several more days to get another phone; after everything was ""said and done"" with my return. In my case I have no money ""sitting around"" waiting to be spent every time a seller makes a mistake. Please Note:This review is based on my own personal experience with this seller, with this particular item. Other buyers might have had different experiences, which could have been either positive or negative.Update 02/20/2014""If you fool me once shame on you, if you fool me twice shame on me"".***Well shame on me this time***I bought another New LG Optimus G Pro from Soles etc. I really wanted this phone, I was kind of: ""Let me give Soles etc a second chance"". Guess what, They dropped the ball again. As soon as I opened the box, I saw the screen protector full of finger print, scratches on the screen, the rear camera has scratches and looked used. This phone was worse than the first one. It went back inside the box right away, printed out the return label, dropped it at my closest UPS store the following day. I did not do it the same day, because I came home late from class that night.I'm very picky when it comes to electronic, I like to keep them always in a perfect condition. Specially cellphone, you have to be very careful with them. If you drop it, it might not work properly again. So, am I going to take the risk of buying an used, scratched cell phone?; which btw suggest that the phone has been abused for US$ 449.00. No way!!!!Just to clarified, I did not purchase this phone as a ""like new"" condition. I bought it as a Brand New Phone.I think that all of you deserve to know this information, we can not give our hard earned money to a company that believe that we are a bunch of uneducated buyers or not smart enough to see the difference between a new phone and an used one.Soles etc is officially on my ""Do not Trust List""My advise to all of you stay away from this seller, do not buy anything from Soles etc. Not even a dollar for fifty cent. Two times, is too much.",67,4
LG,"I received this today (as a present) and could not be happier. The phone is full featured, got the kit kat update, and has plenty of features to make it work for you. It is the first Android phone that I can say is really decent. Big screen, responsive touch, battery seems decent, and has everything I could have hoped for. Finding cases is a challenge, there are no otter box defenders for this. But the phone is decent and worth every penny considering how much a similar sized and featured phone would cost from other manufacturers. This has the nicest screen of any phone in the AT&T store. Emoticons, picture messaging, etc. all work from the native messaging app as though I was using an iPhone.....very nice. You won't be disappointed if you are looking for a nice Andoid phone that is large, but works well.....and has the nicest screen of any of them.UPDATE: I have been using this for about 3 weeks now, and am happy with it. I had a problem with phone calls cutting off, and was about to return it, but I realized the app killer function (built-in) was killing apps every hour and it must have been killing off my phone calls. That said, I turned this off, and have not had any issues since. If you go to the Android.com/filetransfer site, you can transfer media from a MAC to this phone. I have a Windows computer, but didn't have luck synchronizing things with that. The MAC however, with this app for MAC, lets you transfer music from iTunes, pictures, etc. from your MAC to this phone. A very nice feature that didn't work well on other Android phones I had tried. The LG interface does everything I would want it to do. I wanted reminder tones for notifications on text messages, and LG's native message app has this. It also has a little counter on the app icon that tells you how many messages you have in there that are unread. It also has a great browser that lets you see pages without pinching and zooming; the pages just display at the right size most of the time. Native Android doesn't have features in it that I consider mandatory, like notification reminders - but LG's version for this phone does have that. The experience on LG's version of Android is really good - similar to an iPhone that I was using.The only thing I can say that has been frustrating is that every once in awhile, there are times things slow down. In particular, I have not had any of these until one day I went to reply to an email - something I don't normally do from my phone. At that moment, I saw it struggle and slow down. But eventually it caught up and it wasn't that big of a problem. Was happening when I was in a poor signal area, which might have been more of the problem.Everything else has been good. Bought a cradle charger for a spare battery, along with a spare battery, and can carry it with me if I'm going to be nervous about not being able to charge while I'm out. If you disable apps you don't need/use (for me things like Google Music, news, books, all of the AT&T apps, etc.) you can really conserve battery. I can get through a day with plenty of battery left, while having light to moderate use. I keep the screen on AUTO and set the max brightness baseline to 70%. The biggest use of the battery is the screen, and if you want to enjoy it at 100% (which is really too bright) the battery will go out much more quickly. Then again, the screen is so nice, you sometimes want to fully enjoy that beautiful screen so you just leave it plugged into a battery pack or something while you play a game, if you want to keep your battery charged while you play.This is a really nice phone. While the LG G3 just came out and is likely a nice upgrade to this, this does everything I need for a reasonable price. With phone prices now being ""full price"" one way or another, I really paused when thinking about buying a ""new"" one. $30/month x 26 months is a long term commitment, for a phone. Basically it is the cost of a nice laptop, for a phone. And while they are a mini-computer, with a phone, I can't come to deal with that kind of pricing. This phone, as a refurb, has not been a disappointment and saved more than 1/2 over buying a newer, new phone. I get 4G LTE (AT&T) and 4G without fail. I have not gotten 3G, but then I haven't travelled to an area that doesn't have 4G/LTE. Hotspot feature works great and doesn't use endless amounts of battery either.",27,5
LG,"My last phone, the LG Thrill, was a nice smartphone. It did pretty much all that I needed it for. I am not a game player or much of a video streamer. But recently there was a couple of videos that I wanted to show to others and the screen size was a problem. So this time I went for a larger screen. Originally I wanted the Samsung Galaxy Mega. I read many raving reviews as well as a couple that said it was ƒ??too bigƒ??. So I headed to the store to get a feel for myself. Well, for me, the Mega was a bit freakish. So I looked at other phablets that seemed a bit better for me. I saw the Optimus G Pro and compared it to a few others. I really liked the slick and solid feel to it. I was used to LG products and how their software is laid out. After this purchase, I am happy to say that I have had no functionality issues for these 2 months. It works like a champ! And it has almost replaced my Nexus7 tablet (which I love too) as my non-laptop tool of choice.",10,5
LG,"I simply couldn't justify the cost of a Note but after getting and working with this phone, i don't consider it the poor man's Note at all. The display is extremely bright and clear, very fast and the camera is good. I'm not a techie person so I won;t wax on about specs and such; read that for yourself. But if you want a big blazing phone, I recommend this one. There is only one downside I see and that this phone was initially for AT&T so there is a lot of their bloatware to wade through in terms of apps.",33,5
LG,This is not E980This is F310LWhy do you lie?,27,1
LG,"I was being very patient when it came down to purchasing a new smartphone. My last smartphone, (which was also LG) Was a little outdated, but it worked great. When i saw first hand, the size of the new wave of ""Phablets"" I knew i couldn't purchase a normal sized phone. The problem came down to pricing. When i first heard of this phone, it's size, it's features, and most importantly, it's price I knew I couldn't pass it up. The phone came early, I went down to my carrier (Metro PCS) got it set up, and BAM! I love it! Now this may not be typical, but a slight word of caution: i have big hands, so this phone fits great, but I don't feel very confident walking around moving this as i would a normal sized phone. The phone is kinda slick, and the size (in smaller hands) might make you a little nervous handling it. Thankfully, they're plenty of options when it comes down to cases that offer grip, and protection. I have one on the way as i type. Other than that, the phone is a giant freakin win!!.....Why are you still reading this? GO BUY IT",26,5
LG,"I knew I wanted a phone with a large screen (5'""and up), but I didn't want to sacrifice portability. After looking through the galaxy note line, the 5""+ HTC phones, and the Huwei models I came to the conclusion that the LG G Optimus Pro was the optimal choice. (see what I did there?)BUILD With the exception of the Notes 3/4, the G Pro has the highest ratio of screen to front panel of any phablet. At 5.91 x 3.00 x 0.37 inches, the G Pro is only marginally larger than the HTC One M8 (5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 inches) but manages to pack an additional 1/2 inch of screen. The LG G Pro fits well in the majority of my pockets and doesn't limit my range motion any. As for materials, its plastic. It feels like a Happy Meal toy and suffers the same cheap feeling of any other plastic phone. Fortunately, the side of the phone features a metal rim that makes it feel a little more substantial.One of the big things I look for in a phone is a removable battery. It a necessity in the Arizona valley, as the functional lifespan of any battery here is approximately ""til' summer."" Not only does the G Pro come with a removable battery, but comes with plenty of accessories like charging docks and extended batteries.PERFORMANCEWith a 1.7 Ghz quad core processor with 2gb ram, the G Pro is stupidly powerful. I can edit multiple word documents simultaneously without and lag and I've yet to find a game on the play store it couldn't handle. Despite its age, it holds up very well in terms of power. The IPS-LCD screen is phenomenal; it easily out shines the typical amoled/lcd displays I'd grown accustomed to over the years. The colors are bright and distinct and the 400+ ppi makes textures look smooth and refined. Unfortunately, all of this power comes with a price: battery life.At 40% brightness the phone probably puts up about 6 hours of screen time, but this number plummets if when you load a game or run a program script. Under moderate usage with battery conserving settings the phone lasted me through a typical day on a single charge (it has efficient standby conservation). Heavy users will definitely want to purchase a backup or extended battery for this phone.PRICINGThis phone floats are internet new for between $320-$400. I purchased a refurbished one here for $215 from the merchant: phonesforselling.I would recommend this seller whole heartily; my phone arrived in 3 days, coming with a case, charger, and screen wrap. The device was wiped, fully functional, and in pristine condition.CONCLUSIONIt works well for me. For anyone who's strapped for cash and looking for a premium phone experience, you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal than this.",22,4
LG,"I've never written a negative review for either amazon or ebay, but this deserves it. The description clearly states this phone is UNLOCKED. It is not. It is locked and you need to purchase an unlock code to use the phone. To describe the phone as unlocked and then list at&t and t-mobile as carriers this phone will automatically work with is a flat LIE. Amazon should not let OEM shop sell this with that description.",26,1
LG,"If you read the ad for this item, it says in both the headline and description that it is ""Unlocked"". Then if you read on, it says that it is unlocked and will work with AT&T and T-Mobile. I figured this was the perfect solution, since I wanted an Android phone, to ride out the remaining 4 months on my T-Mobile contract. The phone arrived, i put in my sim card, put in the battery, turned it on, and immediately it said ""Network Locked"" on the screen. This means the phone is not ""Unlocked"" as advertised, and requires an unlock code to be purchased from a website. Those codes ranged anywhere from $25-40 on the sites I checked. Then after you purchase the code, most sites take an additional 36-48 hours to email you the code. If the phone is advertised as unlocked, you shouldn't have to pay an additional cost just to make it work with a carrier listed as ok for this phone. In fact, this is a definite euro phone. The charger for the phone as a euro end on it, which has to be plugged into a US converter, and then into the wall. Again, just annoying. Don't waste your time or money on this phone, it will just irritate you. I sent mine back within an hour of getting it from UPS. Spend the extra 25-40 bucks it will cost you to unlock it, and get a better phone. I'd give this negative stars if it would let me. Thumbs down.",21,1
LG,"PROS:The phone does everything desired: Unlocked, quad band, wi-fi, bluetooth, 3G, syncs with google, takes photos, plays music, videos, games...etc. I bought it mainly for using SIMs for prepaid accounts both in US and abroad, and a bit of surfing/emailing when wi-fi is available.CONS:Screen contrast is hard to see outside, but I haven't looked to see if there is a setting for that. Not a deal breaker.Unfortunately, it's LG and difficult to get an update to Android 2.1 while in States, so 1.6 will have to do for most of us....LG has yet to work out all the red-tape kinks, and the phone isn't technically supported in USA. So US residents will have a hard time figuring out how to use the USB cable for anything other than charging, like getting a PC computer to communicate with the SD card (Maybe Linux and Apple users are having an easier time with it?) And it didn't come with a CD or even link to download software for syncing it to your computer...If only LG would realize that their products are being sold in US and lobby a bit harder for allowing full support, regardless of the networks and software developers...Also, because it's only OS 1.6 (Donut), you aren't permitted to use the SD card for executable apps (i.e. expand your phones internal memory), and can only use it for storage and playback, and file/app backups.Note that I've quickly discovered that an internal 200 MB doesn't get you very far...but that was my shortsightedness -- I hadn't planned on overloading it with apps.RECOMMENDATION? The phone itself works great. However, some of the smart device tasks that should be easy (OS updating, accessing SD card, transferring files to and from) might be a bit challenging for most, especially if live LG support is missing. I'd suggest going to the LG website first and seeing if you can select the model in your country's list of available/supported phones...if so, chances are you'll have access to all the tools and fewer problems. If it isn't, then I suggest finding a model that is supported.",14,4
LG,"good afternoon I'm calificadon this because I acquired according to their description of the phone with these frequencies Quad-Band 850/900/1800/1900 Mhz Cellular Band 3G - 850/1900 Mhz, and sent me to the cellular band 3G 900 / 2100 Mhz and it does not work in movilnet or movistar Venezuela. now not to do on your their carelessness, so I elected just phones with specifications do uestdes I inportaban and sent me this.",10,1
LG,"Purchased this phone for a trip i recently undertook. It uses a Full Size SIM Card as opposed to most new phones that sport a Micro SIM slot. Phone performed flawlessly. That being said, there are some things i later found out that may have made me pay more for another Dual Sim phone.Pros:*For about $135, it is a good deal for the functions it performs.*The 8MP camera on this phone is really good. It takes fantastic pictures!*Switching between the 2 Sims could not have been easier. Just touch the dedicated soft button!*Reception ranged from adequate to good.*Battery will get most medium users through a full day of use.*The knock twice to unlock as well as the wake up on sensing movement functions are useful.Cons:*The four soft buttons at the bottom of the phone do not light up. In the dark, you have to remember where they are and what they do. LG should have charged a few $$ more and made these light up. I probably would have bought another phone had i known this earlier.*This phone needs an immediate update to at least Android 4.4.3. As it is right now (4.1.2), multitasking is not possible as the menu button shows options for the app you are in instead of most other updated Android phones that instead allow you to go into a recently opened app.*Absolutely no notification light. Again, LG could have done this for a few $$ more. If you get a call or notification while away, you have no way of knowing by just looking at the phone. You have to wake it up.*On board memory is puny. Its only 4GB but after the OS and other LG apps, you are only left with 1.7GB of usable space. To store pics/videos and several apps, you will definitely need a MicroSD.*There is some slight lag and once or twice i had to restart it to get it functioning as expected. Not really shocking as it uses a 2.5 year old Snapdragon S4 dual core 1Ghz processor with only 768MB of RAM.*You cant have 3G data functionality on both SIMs at the same time. One has to be 2G while the other is in 3G mode. Switching to 3G between SIMs is relatively easy though.I will update this review as i keep using the phone.11/23/14 update: I can no longer recommend this phone. A few weeks back, i was prompted to take an update from LG. It moved my phone from 4.1.2 (Jellybean) to 4.4.2 (KitKat). The internal LG designator is V20. The nightmare began immediately. The phone is now very very laggy. Waiting up to 10 secs for a response to an input is now common. The phone is just slower in every aspect imaginable. Battery life along with signal reception are now below par. In areas where other phones hold a steady signal, this phone will constantly search for a one to latch on to. I have fully charged the battery, picked it up to use the browser and watched the battery drop from 100% to 90% in under 5 mins. Yeah, its that bad. Even receiving a call is now a challenge to answer. Sometimes the phone rings and the screen remains dark. No way to answer the call! If the problem with this phone is the small amount of RAM it has (768MB), then LG should have NEVER released this update. Instead they should have left it at 4.1.2. where it was an above average performer. In conclusion, if you buy this phone, DO NOT take the update to 4.4.2. I am currently looking for a way to roll back to 4.1.2 as LG's botched update to 4.4.2 has destroyed this phone.",37,2
LG,very good very satisfied with the work very well in my country Venezuela recommend it 100% and brings all accessories phone says,12,5
LG,"Very pleased with this phone. Android version 4.1.2 and has not been upgraded from the manufacture, but it does run everything I want so it is acceptable. I need a dual SIM phone to separate my home/personal use from work, and this fits the bill. Internal storage is small, but I understand the cost of the phone, so I can tolerate that. I am not a gamer and only use it for calls, tasks, IM and email and some social networking. Only 3G so it is not as fast as some phones. I live in the mid-west of the United States on the T-Mobile system and reception is as good as other phones I have had. I do like this phone, small and easy to use. I would recommend this phone to others who just need a simple smart phone. I am sure my teenager would need/want a more powerful device, but this one fits my needs.",23,4
LG,#N/A,108,5
LG,"This phone is amazing. it's like a mini laptop.The multitude of aplications downloaded on the phone keep me in touch with the world -weather, news, email, facebook...Its internal memory it's so big that i can download movies, i can record videos and still have enough memory for games or applications.It has lots of themes, lockers, widgets..I just love it, i wouldn't trade it for an iphone.",66,5
LG,"I've had this phone for a little over a month now. The phone cannot find the 4g that comes with my network service (T-Mobile) and since I bought the phone unlocked, I tried to put another sim card with a different company (AT&T) it still couldn't find the 4g or 3g. Also, the phone does not automatically remember the WiFi setting and if the screen goes to sleep, I will either have to wait for it to find the WiFi again or start it back up manually/ When trying to download more than one app or play a game/Facebook while trying to download something in the background, the phone runs slower. When trying to use the zoom on the camera, the photos don't come out very well. On the upside, the sleek look & light weight make for easy carrying and the screen is HUGE (but watching attempting to watch Netflix with the app is a joke!) I love the shortcuts and all other features on the phone & for the price (~$220 + unlocked/no warranty) it's a good bang for your buck, but in today's high-end Smart Phone world, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this phone.",35,3
LG,"I've had about 2 months to play around with the phone and am very pleased so far. I owned a HTC Inspire for 2 years before purchasing this so my battery and performance expectations were already pretty achievable. The phone arrived fairly quickly and came with a male micro-usb to male usb cable, an AC to female usb wall adapter and all the manuals. After the first initial charge I plugged in my SIM card and turned it on. I'm currently on a Family Mobile cell plan and works just fine after a few setting changes. Search for Family Mobile APN settings and it will show you how to configure your phone.Hardware:The phone is very sleek. I bought the white model and get compliments on how nice the phone looks frequently. At first I was surprised at how light it was but now the weight seems very natural. Some people dislike lighter phones because they don't feel as sturdy but it personally doesn't bother me. The back cover has a bit of a flimsy feel to it, but unless you're swapping out SIMs, MicroSDs or batteries frequently you won't notice it that much. The physical home button, the volume rocker and the tactile back and menu buttons are all sturdy and responsive. The screen lock button on the top right of the phone seems too recessed into the phone for my liking, but i'm sure it helps with not accidentally unlocking your screen. The AUX jack on the top left of the phone gives a snug fit and makes good contact with the male end of the cord.Software:To start out, I absolutely love Ice Cream Sandwich. It combines aesthetically pleasing menus with tons of features. One of my main concerns with buying this phone was everyone's complaint about the single core processor. My old HTC Inspire was also a single core processor phone so maybe that's why I don't notice it that much but i've yet to experience any sort of significant lag. This being said, I also compulsively hold the home button down and close any applications i'm done using so it doesn't eat up my process allowance and battery. I'm sure if you were to leave tons of apps running in the background or if you game on your phone it might under perform for you. Video watching on this phone is very enjoyable as well. Whether it be internet streaming or a local file the picture quality is quite impressive. Playing a Blueray quality video file on the phones stock video app plays without lag or buffering which is a huge plus. Screen brightness ranges from very bright to almost off but lacks an auto brightness feature. Rooting was fairly easy once I found the right software. I could not SuperOneClick it but the LG flash tool worked fine. The camera takes decent quality pictures, but the flash is weak. This is a main weak point for me because I like to use my phone as a flashlight, but now I can't.Battery Life:This was the main feature that drew me to the phone. The battery life on the HTC Inspire is HORRIBLE so I wanted to make sure not to make the same mistake twice. Average life seems to be around 12 hours with medium use for me. Juicedefender helps quite a bit, but I also have screen brightness set to 60% (which is pretty bright). I mostly only text, browse the web, and make the occasional phone call so I think 12 hours is pretty reasonable. On the HTC Inspire I would have got 3 hours, so no complaints here. The one thing i've found to REALLY kill the battery is streaming movies and music on your mobile network. When you're connected to Wifi it's not as noticeable, which I almost always am, but for some reason mobile internet drains it. Light to no use and I think the battery would last well over 24 if not 36 hours.Overall I'm still in love with this phone, especially for the price. For someone who is not on a contract (which I am not) ICS + good battery life + factory unlock + sleek design + under $200 = an awesome phone.TLDRPros:Interchangable long life batteryIce Cream SandwichAttractiveLightCheapCons:Low intensity flashCould be sluggish for some usersAwkward screen off button",31,5
LG,"I buy few of those phones for some of my friends. Actually I buy one and everybody liked it, so I buy for them few unlocked phones ( I leave in Trinidad). The last phone I buy for my friend, came here locked. I was very upset because the shipment cost me almost 100USD and to send it back it cost me another 100USD shipping + taxes) so I send a ""bad"" review to the supplier. Mr. Jake send me an e-mail stating that it was a mistake and he is willing to make it up for me only to remove the ""bad review"". I, like a truly christian and innocent, thought that he is feeling sorry for the mistake and he will send the money to unlocked the phone ( so he let me understand in his e-mail). Of course since the moment I delete the bad review I never heard about Mr. Jake again. I just want to tell mr. Jake that that was not nice of him especially as a manager of HassleFreeCell.

LG,"I ordered an Lg Optimus L7 that cost me $179.99 from this seller back in late May 2013. Recently(July 2013) the phone started giving me major problems, the phone can no longer make or receive calls. I contacted Amazon about the issue and they told me to contact this seller. They told me to contact Lg for my warranty, Lg then told me since i had purchased an ""unlocked"" phone they can basically can do nothing for me. I was then told by Lg to reach out to my service provider to sort the issue out. They then told me to contact the manufacture because the phone was now defective. I then called back Amazon who then filed an ""A to Z Claim"". I received an email a few hours later stating that my claim has been denied, the 30 day period was up. I then called amazon asked the person over the phone to look at my account at all the heart-ache i was going through and they told their was nothing they could do for me. I went through amazon.com to buy a phone cost me $179.99 and a few months later the phone is defective. I take care of my phones I never drop them or anything of the sort that would cause the phone to malfunction.Amazon and Wireless Everything will steal your money.",13,1
LG,"The phone is great. Consider something smaller if you have a small hand. Wi-Fi works great, and it works great on T-Mobile.",17,5
LG,It's a basic complete phone for those who don't want to spend a lot of money and to have all the capabilities of a smart phone and the principal feature that is 4g but the VGA resolution is not a good characteristics for ones who are used to HD resolution but it works,11,4
LG,"For the price and feature set, it's hard to find a better positioned mobile device. There is an LG issued firmware update to Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, this does not void your warranty. I updated in 5 minutes using SmartFlash. This makes the interface faster and more intuitive, too many improvements to list. It really breathes new life into the device and leapfrogs many in the market.Battery life is suitable for my usage.Another major consideration was the network bands. In Trinidad and Tobago carriers use 850/1900 bands for voice and data respectively. It's important to note that the black version of this phone does not meet those requirements. Only the white will work.In total it worked out to 1500 TTD including skybox costs.",12,5
LG,"I first bought LG P970H in September 2011. That phone was from Spain or it was exported to Spain, i'm not sure. Its languages were only English and Spanish. It worked very well. The touch screen was very sensitive. The color spectrum was great. I loved it a lot. Unfortunately, it was stolen when I shopped at a shoes store in late March 2012. How miserable I was!Then I had to buy another one. People suggested me buy iphone. But for me, LG P970 was the best. It was light, slim, and had a wide screen. I loved the camera functions too. It was great for people who like taking pictures of themselves. It was really nice for playing video games too.However, this time I bought LG P970 from another seller. The phone was to be sold to Asian markets like China, Indonesia, Korea, and Vietnam, I guess, because the user book has languages of all these countries. I felt something weird this time, and it turned out to be true. The phone operates at a slower rate. The touch screen is not as sensitive as the previous one. Out-of-service condition happens at times.Still, I love Android. It has a lot of free stuffs. For example, I like taking pictures myself and I find Camera Effects and LittlePhoto applications are awesome, much better than Instagram.Anyway, I still recommend this phone to anybody. Just be careful to check its origin first before deciding to purchase. LG P970H from Spain is a suggestion.",10,4
LG,"I've been using my LG 970 Optimus Black for two months now and I simply love it! I bought it unlocked for use in Uruguay, South America. It's light and slim, very comfortable to handle and use, with an awsome display, very clear and bright, even under direct sunlight, and also very responsive to the touch. Very fast on the Internet and mail. It also takes very good pictures with or without flash, with lots of settings to personalize your shots as you wish. I've downloaded many cool applications from the Android Market, most of them free or with very low cost. The only thing I'm not completely satisfied with is battery life. With a moderate use of Internet, WiFi and 3G on only during the day, it lasts less than a day. However, after installing Juicedefender Ultimate from the Android Market, it now lasts aproximately a day and a half ... not that bad. But its excellent performance and sound quality greatly compensate for this drawback.January 9, 2012.After 5 months of use, I've kind of fallen out of love with it... well, not completely, but it's not my prince charming any more... I've had a serious event of denial to reboot after running out of battery, and had to take it to the service where the only option was to make a hard reset, thus losing all my personal settings and downloads, luckily not my pictures which were stored in the mini card! I read a blog on this rebooting issue, and apparently it happens frequently with this model, also when you try to block the display with the on/off button. I'm very attentive now to the battery level and have downloaded a blocking-display application, so that I don't have to use the power button to do it. This has worked so far.March 5, 2012.2 months having past since my last review, I must say that I've run out of battery three or four times, and also had to turn off the phone because it had frozen, and I had no problem whatsoever upon turning it back on. I made sure each time to wait some minutes before turning it on after turning it off or starting the battery charge, perhaps that made the difference. In summary: I'm very happy with my LG 970 again!",30,5
LG,"I have to update my review - this is the slowest piece of junk I've ever had. It freezes all the times, takes about 10 secs to open any app, keyboard app (when I'm trying to type a text) stops working at least once a day. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this phone. It's trash.When I first got the phone I was very pleased with it - nice design, great bright display.First problem I ran into in texting - it's pretty bad, keys are non-responsive, I usually had to touch the space 3-4 times before it works. Very frustrating. Scrolling down when browsing is really bad too - it either doesnt scroll at all, or scrolls way too much. Even more frustrating. And the worst thing is battery. I don't expect it to last for days, but it won't even last half a day. And I don't use it much at all. Recently it started dying overnight. I would go to bed when it's fully charged, wake up in the morning and it's at 30%. Seriously? I don't have a data plan, tried switching of Wi-fi, nothing helps. I checked the battery use - 50% Mobile Standby, 49% - Mobile Idle. WOW! I have no idea what's going on, but it's unacceptable. I really wish I chose a differnet phone. Can't believe it has great reviews.Would like to improve my review - the battery issue has disappeared on itself, now it lasts for a couple of days. Not sure why it was so bad when I first got it, but glad it's fine now. It's still a little slow at times, which is frustrating, but I don't expect much from a phone in this price range.",13,2

I think the seller of bad faith, be careful. Thanks Amazon for offering me the opportunity to express my views about seller.",11,2
LG,"PROS: Speedy Delivery. Unlocked/Sim supported. Included basic supported material.CONS: Will require USB cord purchase and knowledge of converting ringtones. Does not support 3G Network.

Oh yeah, it is not actually black.Summary: If you have very little knowledge of cell phones and just wish to make/receive calls and basic supported texts, this may be a useful phone for you. But if you're the kind of user that expects all media files recieved to be immediately viewed upon opening, a variety of ringtones or supplied ones to be assigned individually and converted in factory, fm radio, a USB cord provided and an easy to use interface...Wait till your uprgrade or dish out the extra fundage for a more compatible phone to your liking.",59,3

She loves the touch screen. she wishes that it had a better variety of ringtones but this doesn't interfere with the function of the phone. The only down fall is it didn't come with a instruction booklet or an earpiece, because she like to talk and put the phone in her pocket so she doesn't have to hold it and this is why the earpiece would be very handy. I wanted to purchase another one for myself but according to my daughter, its not cool for mom and daughter too have the same phone in the same color...maybe if it was in another color.",12,4

LG,"I bought this phone to replace my wife's Verizon contract phone which died one month after expiration of the warranty, which is eleven months before the end of the contract period. The price through Amazon was half of what Verizon wanted to replace the phone. Overall, the Spectrum is a nice smartphone. The size is a good balance of good viewing vs compactness. The display is crisp and I have not had any problems running any Android apps. The only issues that I have with the phone is sometimes the menu is a little obtuse and the premature demise of the Spectrum phone which prompted this purchase. However, the predecessor phone was not truly dead; it just had ""issues"". And my Spectrum, purchased at the same time as my wife's Spectrum contract phone is still running.",24,4

LG,"I don't know why people are giving this phone such negative reviews because for me even though I bought it used its still the best bang for your buck.

At this rate I definitely plan on keeping this phone for a LONG time!",16,5
LG,"The LG V10 exceeds my expectations! I had read all these reviews complaining about the battery and playing down some of its better qualities; I seriously considered the Samsung Galaxy Note 7... But when they announced the features and the *gasp* price!!! There's no WAY I'm spending $850 for a relatively modest upgrade with no way to change out a battery that you KNOW will eventually become useless! So, in the end, the 64 gigabytes of internal storage, the micro SD card slot to increase that capacity, the excellent quality camera for both stills and videos, as well as the much more reasonable price of the LG V10 won me over! And now that I've used it for several days, I'm even more impressed with its multitude of useful features - the multiple ways of opening the phone, the speed of the programs, the outstanding photo editing, the quick access to a manual note app - all are really impressing me! And even though I was initially hesitant about getting a large phablet, I'm really finding myself loving it! I don't try to keep it in my pocket; instead I carry it in a very small crossbody bag. Oh, and incidentally, I got this as a factory refurbished model and I paid only $300! It has an admittedly brief warranty, so if this ends up disappointing me, I'll come back to add to this review.",11,5
LG,"The price of this device has dropped substantially since launch. Originally I would have never even thought of recommending this glorified g4, but now at the lowered price it is the perfect utilitarian phone.Display:The display is vibrant, brighter than most amoled panels, and gets darker than any other LCD. The black levels are better than most LCDs but not great compared to an amoled. The secondary display produces noticeable blacklight bleeding which is a bummer but liveable. My unit had a very accurate white balance unlike most that have a noticeable blue tint, I don't know if it is just my unit or if lg updated the display calibration with marshmallow.Performance and ui:Performance is great, lg's user interface was once known to stutter like touchwiz, but now it performs just like you would expect from any proper flagship. I never experience dropped frames and the whole UI is always running at a stable 60 fps. The fingerprint scanner is fast, but the first try fails pretty often. The ram management is good but the android system itself consumes more ram than a nexus due to the heavy skin.Camera:The great manual features really show that lg has matured and is starting to implement their own unique features. It records 4k at a bitrate higher than any other phone at the moment and the automatic mode does an amazing job of showing accurate colors, even when recording under artificial light. One area that can improve is low light performance.Audio:The lg v10 is a huge step up from the g4 in terms of audio quality. The separate ess sabre DAC chip and opamp show big changes from the g4's mediocre audio quality. The amp is powerful enough to drive even the most demanding headphones like the akg q701 easily, and the DAC removes some of the hissing commonly produced by integrated snapdragon DACs while making the music sound a bit fuller in tone. Even though the speaker is only a mono bottom facing speaker, it is pretty decent sounding and incredibly loud. Makes my HTC one m8 speakers sound quiet in comparison.Battery life:The only area that prevents this phone from being perfect in my opinion. I get around 3 and a half hours of screen on time with heavy use, 4 hours max. This is not a problem if you have a spare battery but it still is not an excuse for why the much larger lg v10 has the same battery capacity as the lg g4, lg g3, and the lg g2",24,4
LG,"The LG V10 was LG's flagship device of last year which in my opinion was extremely underrated at the time of release. Sporting a Snapdragon 808 processor, four gigabytes or ram, a large 5.7"" QHD display with a smaller secondary display, and of course two front-facing cameras, and a 16 mega-pixel back camera with an F1.8 aperture and you're left with a very impressive device to say the least. LG opted for the Snapdragon 808 processor due to Qualcomms latest SOC having horrible over-heating problems at the time in most devices that it was used in. While not the latest and greatest processor available at the time, the Snapdragon 808 is no slouch even to this day. That paired with the four gigabytes of ram leave you with zero lag in almost any task I have put this thing through. Even heavy gaming with some modern Android games still look and play flawlessly with little to no problems in frame rate and graphical prowess. The four gigabytes of ram lets you multi-task with ease to your hearts content, but it does also help with the second screen I mentioned earlier in the review. The second screen is a small two inch long display on top of your main display which gives you access to things like your notifications, and some quick toggles for things like Wi-Fi and the flashlight even when your device's main screen is off! It is very hard to convey how useful this second screen is but trust me, once you get used to it you'll find it difficult to go without it. LG says that if you leave the secondary display on all day, you'll lose just a few percentage of your battery and I personally think it is well worth it due to the additional functionality that it provides.The main display of the phone is 5.7"" with a QHD resolution and LG's Quantum Display technology. While the term does sound like a marketing gimmick, the display is indeed very nice to use. Outdoor visibility is excellent on both of the displays, and colors look life like but vibrant at the same time. The display is not AMOLED which is what a lot of people prefer, but do not let that sway your purchasing decision if you're in the market for a phone because this display is equally good from what I've seen so far. Viewing angles, contrast, brightness, and even the black levels are all excellent and you will not have any problems using this device for things like multi-media or games.The cameras on the front of the device (and yes I did say cameras) are both five mega-pixels, one has a very wide viewing angle which you can switch between for things like selfies. This works great and does in fact give a very wide shot. The back camera is to me one of the bigger selling points of this phone for one simple reason which is the manual controls. Sure you can take some fast shots and you'll get impressive results, but you can also turn on manual mode which lets you tweak every setting of the camera to adjust for white balance, the ISO, shutter speed, and even the manual focus levels. These controls are very impressive and really do make a huge difference in the shots you'll be able to take particularly for late night shots. I was even able to take a few shots of the stars at night when it was pitch dark outside without much experience tweaking all of the controls. The manual controls are not just limited to photos either, you can also use them for filming video as well! You'll even have full access to the microphone levels and a wind-noise filter.There are plenty of other features of this phone such as the DAC which makes for an incredible music listening experience, the removable battery, the SD card slot, and a lot of other note worthy features but for the sake of time I am going to not be adding all of that to this review. If you want to know anything else about this device or using it in 2016 then feel free to ask and I'd be happy to help to the best of my abilities. Even with the LG V20 coming out, if you need a new device then this is very hard to beat especially with the price these are currently selling for. The performance, and features still hold up today and I would highly suggest giving it a shot if you're on the fence about this device.",16,5
LG,"Keep in mind, this is the international version. But after making everything English and American during set up, you wouldn't know it. This phone is AMAZING. Stop looking, this is the phablet you want. I have had it for over a month now, and coming from iPhone, I wasn't sure how it would go. Really user friendly, amazing photos, open OS for better customization. I just can't believe how much I love it. The camera alone is worth it, and I spent a month researching camera phones before selecting this one.",10,5
LG,"LG V10 H962. I've only had this phone for a week. Here are the pros and cons so far.Pro.1. Replaceable battery.2. Upgradeable storage.3, Unlocked phone, dual sim slots.Con.1.

It does support voice ,GSM and 3G data services with ATT.Overall, I wish I could get LTE connectivity with my phone but with my usage patterns I wouldn't benefit from the additional bandwidth anyway. For my use the flexibility of having an unlocked phone with upgradeable storage and replaceable battery far outweigh the lack of LTE service.I would purchase again.",17,4
LG,"My favorite phone ever. Great display, great look (not for everyone-- it's rugged-- but I love it personally), great speed (sure, it doesn't have the same benchmark scores as some of the newer phones today, but I have not experienced any difficulties and use it to play the newest games as well... You can look up reviews on YouTube, just about everyone will mention how there is no real-life difference in how this phone performs when stacked up against phones that are technically more powerful.Great camera. To be honest I don't use most of the functionality most of the time... but I have had instances where the Auto mode (which is great) isn't quite capturing the lighting or hue how I would like, and in these instances I switch over to Manual mode and am able to get the perfect shot. Moral of the story: Even if you are not a big photo enthusiast, which I am not either, and even if you don't see yourself using the Manual mode, it's still worth it to have this feature for those valuable occasions when you do need it.Also, the second screen is very useful to me. Seriously. At first, I struggled to use it, and I felt that I was just trying to use it because it was there and I felt I wasn't using the phone to its full potential if I wasn't using that second screen. But after about a month, I found the areas for which I really do like to use it, and it became very valuable. Personally, I would say the top features of the second screen that I use are: 1) Music player. I am always playing music from Google Music Player. When working out. When just sitting around at home. When writing this review. When using other apps, etc. It's really really nice to have to turn the main screen on just to change a song. Equally, when I am actually using the phone, i.e. using the browser or in WhatsApp or any other app, it's great to be able to switch songs but just giving one press to the mini-screen up top, without having to close any app I am using at that moment. 2) Most recently used apps. I'm not going to go into detail, but having your five most recent used apps displayed, in the order in which they were last used, becomes a super efficient way of going back and forth between apps (coping a link from an SMS message someone sent, one touch on mini screen to enter GMail where I was composing a message, pasting the link, then one touch on mini screen to go back to the SMS to confirm that I sent the link, then one touch to go into Chrome which I was just using before someone sent me a link, etc.). It's also valuable when, for example, looking up something on Chrome, then instantly switching back to whatever I was using. For example, I could go into Settings, realize I need to Google something, so one-touch to Chrome, then look up the needed info and then one touch back to the Settings, then one touch back to Chrome if needed... I even saw a technician at the AT&T store configuring a V10 in this way. 3) Favorite contacts. It's just awesome to one-touch to call favorite contacts. 4) Flashlight from off-screen. Well, this is probably more valuable to me than others, as I work in a developing country where the power goes out a lot, so it's awesome to be able to one-touch to the flashlight from when the main screen is off.The other functionalities of the second screen... like displaying favorite apps... I didn't find so useful. Displaying favorite apps seems like a practical idea, but in reality you will find that you very rarely use your favorite apps at the same time, and you will find yourself wanting to open an app that is not displayed as your favorite. For example, I might be in Chrome, and I realize I need to go back to my To-Do List app and write something else... except it's not a Favorite app for me, so either way I have to close Chrome and go into my To-Do List app. You will find that it just becomes more logical to display your most recent used apps up there (because essentially by definition those are the apps that you are using ""in the moment"", and thus the ones you are most likely to need right there and then). Of course, you can have the phone display both the Favorite apps and the Recent apps on the top mini screen... but then by default it will show your Favorite apps and you will always have to swipe to go see your Recent apps, and so I just found it made the most sense to display the Recent apps up there but not display any Favorite apps at all. But hey! That's why you have options. This phone let's you do what you want!Oh by the way, after having the phone for three months, I tried using it without the second screen (I turned it off), and really found myself missing it a lot. I kept wanting to use it, then realizing I can't because it's off. Which is testament to the fact that it's truly useful to me (okay, technically I have only established that I have made a habit out of using it, which doesn't necessarily mean it is useful, as we all have bad habits, but whatever, I think it's a great feature!).",11,5
LG,"I LOVE THS PHONE...I got it because i had a Samsung galaxy S6 with 32G and no removable battery....and I hate that...so I swich to LG....and got the awesome LG V10....I'm very impressed.

This slim small one fits perfect in my Levis jeans front right coin change/watch pocket. Excellent audio, pics and video as well. Long life battery too. Does what you want for around $50 new, plus I use Verizon at $40 monthly rate. I get what I basically want, the ability to make and receive clear audio calls in and out and those quick text messages.

LG,I order this phone because my last one fell in a puddle. It was my first touch phone and my first phone purchase online. I am not in the least bit disappointed. The phone shipped 5 DAYS EARLY!!!

The phone works beautifully and actually exceeded my expectations. I highly HIGHLY recomend this phone and the seller.,10,5

Answering and disconnecting calls is so easy to do, no sliding like with the android. But as far as texting it is not the best. I like larger buttons and that is why I wanted a slide out keyboard. But the buttons are too small to easily text. I also noticed that the screen is not as sensitive to touch as it should be. Trying to get something on the screen to move or work can be frustrating because it takes some effort to manipulate, move, whatever. The battery is not as bad as some reviewers have stated. It lasts a couple of days with normal use. It is NOT a smartphone so don't expect it to be. But, all-in-all, I give it a B overall.",96,3
LG,"This is a true quad band phone, it serves me well in hard to reach service areas. The touch screen is fully functional, but the slide out keyboard makes texting or note taking a breeze. Pretty good camera with a flash, the image editing software is very handy. This is a smart phone without having to have a smart phone plan and works well with ATT basic data package. Holds a pretty good charge, even though I average about 200-400 texts on a busy day. Great bluetoothe technology and syncs flawlessly with blue tooth in newer vehicles. The extra memory card you can install slips into the side of the phone, no having to take apart the phone to switch it. There is an mp3 player that allows you to play songs on your phone at a very decent volume, or through your car's stereo if its bluetoothe ready. I have recommended this phone to friends. I recommended it to my mom who is not to keen on newest phone features but with this she is able to text, take pictures and make calls easily. If you run too many programs at once for example, a chat aim window, a video game *monopoly which is awesome* and a text window, jumping back in forth there is a slight lag. This is very slight, closing the slider or hitting the end call button snaps the phone back and its all good from there. Also, one problem I noticed some newer phones have is being able to jump from 3g to 4g cell service areas automatically without having to restart the phone. I went through three phones with that same issue until I got this phone, no need to restart it jumps service areas without any problem.",60,5
LG,"We got this phone as a replacement for my daughter. It met her wants (touch screen and a keyboard) so we thought we would give it a try. She loves this phone. I was a little weary about the touch screen because of some of the other reviews, but its perfect for her. Not ultra sensitive (a slight accidental touch doesn't send if off to a new screen), but sensitive enough to be easy to use. The key pad works well and she loves the camera.",11,4
LG,"If you want a basic phone, don't need of all the apps like the newer smart phones this is a good phone.",11,4
LG,"I have at&T and I had this model with them, but unfortunetley I dropped it pretty hard and broke it, but I love this phone, the features are great and I use the media player in the gym to listen to my music. I love that you can add memory to it. So on the tiny disc, I have my presentations, music and famiy pictures. It is great and easy to use. I lvoe that it is touch screen and it has a keyboard.BAD if the touch screen stops working you will not be able to text message, their is no way to write text messages AND send them without the touch screen. I have had several of these models and twice this has happen, but I do drop my phone quite a lot. I have always had trouble with phones, but I do really enjoy this model.Love it fits in your pocket, not big.. fits very good in your hands..aand the features are great",26,5
LG,"so excited the day I received my phone. right off not able to text had to take to ATT store, had to change a # that was still in phone. worked great for ONE week bought an awesome cover for it then totally DIED ON ME. back to ATT store & not able to help or explain why. bought new battery to try to save my purchase but NO GO. Now using my dad's old phone that has 3 letters on each key! SO BUMMED!! now I have to save $ all over again",26,1
LG,I originaly got this phnoe for my teenage daughter couple of years ago through the service provider. I'm very please with this product and that's why I ordered a replacement phone of the same model.,23,4
LG,"I had a pantech duo c810 and I started having issues with it, like when I would call someone I could hear them but they couldn't hear me...I was told it had something to do with the microphone when I called pantech and that it would cost like $60 or so to fix, so I just decided to buy a new phone. I came across this phone on amazon. This phone is not unlocked but it works with AT&T and I have heard you can unlock it by looking for the code online supposedly. I like this phone because when you lock the screen the date and the time appear in large text/font when you hit a button to light up the screen when locked. The thing I don't like about it compared to my pantech is that you can't set it to where you enter your pin number every time you lock your phone. I have my pin set for when I turn this phone on and this is all I have been able to figure out with regards to using a pin # on this phone. So that's a downside that you can't lock this phone with a pin # all the time, just with a touch of a button. Also, I have found that if you text a lot the inbox gets full rather quickly so you have to delete your conversations daily like every other week or so depending on how much you text. I don't mind doing that but some of you might. The battery seems to be holding ok...but I have found that if you use a lot of the applications on this phone like going online, etc. it takes up a lot of the charge rather quickly, if that's the case and how you'll be using it I recommend you take your charger with you. I think I'm going to by an sd card for it in hopes it diverts that away from my battery's charge...I dunno if that will work or not but I think I'm going to give it a try anyway. Maybe it will help with the inbox texting issue...I dunno. Other then that I love this phone. The sound quality is nice and loud. For example, my grandmother who is hard of hearing could hear me on this phone! : D It has all that I need on it. it takes a while to get used to the touch screen aspect of it but you get used to it rather quickly...at least I did. I recommend you buy a screen protector for it as well as a hard snap on case when you purchase this phone all at the same time as you will come to find you need it. I recommend the hard snap on case because if you are a person like me who drops their phone a lot then it will protect it and this phone is so light the case adds a little bit more weight to it (not much) but just enough to where you feel more comfortable holding the phone and more comfortable to the point that you feel like you won't drop it as much. Also, you touch the screen to dial and such so that is why I recommend you getting a screen protector for it. This phone also comes with the 2 holes in it for a lanyard just so you guys know : ) Otherwise I would recommend this phone.",23,4
LG,"I love this phone. My old phone that i had was a Pantech Link two. It was acting up like crazy, and wouldn't let me text. I would NOT recommend that phone, and the picture quality was absolutely terrible! My mom decided she wants to switch from at&t to Verizon in 3 months and so i didn't want to buy an extremely expensive phone and then just have to give it up and get a different phone for Verizon. No, that would have been wasted money. So I found this phone and went to the refurbished section. I found one that was $33.00 plus $4.00 in shipping. and considering originally if i wanted this phone to be new, i would have had to pay $70.00 that is a great deal to buy a $33.00 phone. Especially since I am only 14 and don't have much money. My mom got an email saying the phone had been shipped, and the estimate arrival date was two weeks, :( two days later a box delivered from amazon arrived, MY PHONE HAD COME! to start you can set a signature and the pic quality is amazing. My fav color is blue and that is the color of the phone. I have dropped it 3 times and it hasn't gotten a single scratch!!! AMAZING. The keyboard slides easily and is very easy to text on. This phone has gotten some bad reviews about how terrible the touch screen is, but if you go to the volume changing buttons on the side and click at the top on the button that says touchtone, and then set the volume to silent, then the touchscreen is amazing. and it works amazingly. I lovvvvvvvvve this phone and will defiantly be recommending this phone to my friends. thank you amazon this was a great buy and is a great relief from my old phone.",20,5
LG,"If you are looking for a phone and by phone I mean ""Hello how are you doing?"" then this is the phone for you, but if you are looking for a multimedia/slash apps driven device then search for another phone. This phone is great for text and has great call quality, I have also dropped it a couple of times and it is very durable even though it doesn't feel like it should be.",16,4
LG,i ordered this as a replacement phone. I have the same kind and wanted one that didn't have issues. But what i got was one with more problems. Not happy and was lead to think it worked.,10,1
LG,"Best of the best. There is no question in my mind that Microsoft leads now in innovation and design. I got my first Lumia 520 as a temporary replacement for a malfunctioning iPhone and it was love at the first sight. Now I got this 640 Xl, its mine not like an iPhone or others and it is wonderfully designed, fast operating system and great battery life. Ordered and came in less than 1 week. Installed my microsim from ATT and it was running smoothly. The only issue was it came from China or HK and everything the screen instructions were in chinese...so I got in YouTube and found a clip explaining how to change the language to english and with a little bit of imagination it took me a couple minutes to do it. The double sim card is going to be handy since we travel overseas and I am sick of ATT overpriced rates. By the way both cards appear to be ""active"" so I will be able to choose and pick on the go which phone number to use. Another little issue is that the charger that came with the phone is a weird one ( I think I have seen this type in the UK) so I use another USB cable but it must be a thick one like my Surface 3 otherwise there is a message that the charging process will be slow. By the way, no need of expensive cases unless you are prone to dropping things. The 640 XL fits perfectly in my jeans front pockets.So...it is a great phone and trust me..I am a recovering appleholic that still hangs to his iPad mini but now is sold to the idea that for now the future in technology and design is in Microsoft.Five stars because this phone is more that what I was expecting and now ai am ready for W10",50,5
LG,Replaced the Nokia Lumia 1520 with the Lumia 650 XL LTE. Technically wise it is a lesser phone but functionally it is superior with no issues so far. I have T-Mobile and wanted to use this for LTE in the US. At first it appears the phone only does 4G as that is the highest speed you can select but after running speed tests against a iPhone 5 at LTE speeds the results were about the same. We concluded that the origin of these are from China which do not dictate 4G from LTE as far as T-Mobile is concerned. This is more evident in the box that shows the phone displaying 4G at the top and noting in the back that it is indeed the LTE model. So skeptical at first but now a believer.,12,5
LG,"This is an old phone, no longer in production. This review is more of a rant than a useful review as I'm sure the number of people considering this phone is extremely limited. Read-on if you are looking for the details I seem to care about.The vendor, UniqueBuys did a great job, delivering exactly what they offered and ahead of schedule.I have been ordering inexpensive little phones all Summer trying to find one that has fewer issues than the others.The LG GS170 (T-Mobile branded) scores about even with the other phones I have.So far, the best one has been the Samsung SGH-A107 (not as many features, but well designed and with good software).The good:It's about the right size.It has enough features to entertain you as well as make it through the day.It's built solid enough to be a daily-use phone.It looks nice (with exception to the composition of the case coating).It uses a ""standard"" USB connector for recharging. (some data services are available through this connection, you have to use Bluetooth for file and picture transfer. There is no iSync of addresses of calendar information).The bad:- It is slow, the software is asking too much from the little processor, result is the menus are slow and there's some lag between the press of a key and a result.- If you use your own Wallpaper image you are penalized by having to wait up to two seconds for the soft-keys on the screen to appear after opening the flip. (Menu & Options)- The display power management has been co-opted to serve the vendor and not the customer. Power is wasted displaying useless stuff on the external display while you use the phone for a call. (you are a walking billboard for LG)- The software is not logically ordered. It takes several key presses to reach commonly used features and stuff you will have little use for has been ""pushed forward"" by T-Mobile in an attempt to get you to use services. (this is common of ""branded"" phones, so you get what you pay for in this respect) Even with special keys for Messages and the camera, there are still hoops to jump through where other implementations (other phones) are better at serving the features than on this phone.- A press of the side key(s) to activate the external display is buffered and processed after the display lights. Result is, the Date is displayed a fraction of a second after the display becomes active requiring a second key press to return showing the Time. The Time does show after a delay in which you must stare at the phone or miss the Time readout before the display goes dark again.- The 4-way pad and center button are flat and feature no tactile clues. You can not feel the center button and none of it is back lighted. In low-light locations, it is very hard to use features involving the 4-way and center button.- The casing, while strong is noisy. Handling the phone produces crackling sounds that your friends will complain about while you are on a call. The speaker-phone feature might have been an afterthought addressing this problem.The Ugly:- The phone is coated in a rubber-like substance that attracts dirt and pocket fluff like a magnet. You can not simply wipe the phone down with a cloth as the surface clings to cloth and pulls additional debris from the cloth adding to the mess. The only way I have found to clean the phone is to wipe it with a damp lint-free camera lens cloth and then air-dry it on the counter top. Most other plastic cell phones can be cleaned simply by wiping with your t-shirt. Also, in my experience this kind of coating will decompose into a sticky mess after a year or so of handling. Ever touch a Ryobi cordless drill? It's like that.- The file system is ""broken"" in that should you install a file with an extension the phone does not recognize, the only way to delete the file is a Master Reset (Master Reset access code is 0000 <that's four zeros> I had to search this so here it is for you to use). You can not even delete the file through Bluetooth, the delete Bluetooth message returns a bad command error message. Be careful, you can fill-up the phone's memory with crap and have to do a Master Reset to clear it all out.- As with most of these phones, the camera is only slightly better than simply drawing a picture of what you see for yourself.Pictures taken with the phone are not the same aspect ratio or file size as images to be used for Wallpaper so all your pictures will have a white border in them if you try to use them as Wallpaper. Loading an image through Bluetooth works, but you -must- be careful or you end-up with an incorrect file size or a bad file extension that the phone does not recognize. Hello Master Reset :)I have returned to using my Samsung A107, this LG T-Mobile branded phone is not ""good enough"" to take-up any more of my time.p.s. People have asked my why I don't use an iPhone, ""you can afford it, hell you buy all those little crap phones!""The reasons are many and some trivial but the bottom line is, I don't want a cell phone draining my time with trivial pursuits. I have no need of games on a tiny screen and I can remember 99% of the phone numbers and other information I need through the day.What I want is analogous to a pocket pay phone. I want to be able to make/receive a call and occasionally send/receive a text message. What's so hard about that? It seems to me cell phone manufacturers fail at the core of their calling.Thanks for reading, I feel better now :)",10,3
LG,"I recommend this phone for people who want a simple, small cell that can be used right out of the box with a very small learning curve to it. The LG-GS170 is an excellent choice for those that have never used a smartphone, and want an easy phone that has the ability to have some features you would like to try for short money.I have only had this for less than one month, but have taken it out of state and it did not let me down. I will follow up this review if anything changes.To date, it is my favorite basic phone to recommend and use. I have not had any issues at all with dropped calls as another reviewer mentioned. Sounds to me they received a defective one.Here are the Pros that I have found with zero cons:The battery life for me has been excellent.Extremely user friendlyVery easy for those that are non-tech.Large keypad.Clarity on both ends of callslarge keypad.",18,5
LG,"Excellent phone. Works with T-Mobile (my carrier in California). Everything works perfect; call, text, WiFi, GPS, etc. (Note: for picture sending you have to call T-Mobile so that they can install the configuration for picture sending, since it's not a T-Mobile native phone. What they do is, they send you a text with a link which you click and it auto installs the configuration and you are in business . . . simple).The speed is great for a 95 dollar phone (works better than a 400 dollar phone). I'm not too convinced about the camera, but the pictures are still decent. You can record video and upload straight to your Youtube account with just a couple of clicks.For the music, you just drag and drop your music folders and create playlists one folder at a time (not just a song at a time). *Note: for this you have to install Astro File Manager, so read about it or ask me how to use it.I am very happy about this phone, I got one for my daughter too and she loves it . . . she says it works much much better and much faster than her crappy Motorola Cliqu XT.I totally recommend this phone, specially at this price to keep you contract-free.",18,5
LG,"I must say that my disappointment lies not with the phone itself...but, that this phone was a prepay and Verizon would NOT activate without some lame excuse of wanting me to pay 6 months prepay first. I was furious. I lost the box and information or I would return it to sender! If you are considering purchasing a phone in this manner..I caution you that it may come up as a prepay. Company will NOT activate without charging you!!!",11,1
LG,"I can't rate the phone itself since I'm unable to use it, but I would advise people to be very careful dealing with this vendor (PagePlusDeals). The first phone that they sent me stopped working after 2 days and I asked for a replacement. They did send a replacement without any hassle although it did take twice as long as promised. Now that I have the second phone it cannot even be activated with Verizon since it's a 'prepaid' phone that cannot be added to an existing account, it has to be used for 6 months with a prepaid plan first. So at this point, my only option is to also return this second phone.I'd advise people not to deal with PagePlusDeals. They obviously have problems delivering what they promise and trying to save a few bucks just isn't worth the potential hassle, at least for me.",12,1
LG,"this phone is basically indestructable. Mine finally broke after 4 year.. it had been swimming in the lake, fell in a bucket of water sealing stain & laid on a cooktop which melted a few of the buttons & this thing just kept on working. It's demise finally came this winter when it slipped out of my hand & fell to the parking lot busting off the hinged lid. So the display didn't work but the phone still did.... So i bought another one.. in the days of smart phones... phewwy... this good ole flip phone will do me just fine. Hope this one lasts as long & as well as it's predicessor.",27,5
LG,"I've had this same phone since I first signed up for a cell phone, but I'm now on my 3rd one. Not because it doesn't work, but the long-time use & age of the other two rendered them kaput! But, both survived getting wet, frequent dropping, and they still worked fine. My friends' with Smartphones should have such a phone that doesn't drop calls like theirs do.",13,5
LG,"Bought this phone thinking that ""This product has been extensively tested, is certified to be 100% functional, and ready for activation""as quoted from there product page which should mean that I could use it on any verizon line, only to find out that it is a pre-paid phone and can not be activated on my account until its active for 6 months, what a waste of time!",22,1
LG,"It has been over a week since I was promised to receive my merchandise, and yet I still have not received. I'm also unable to receive any information relative to tracking the product and determining a location. I am highly disappointed and feel this is bad customer service and unprofessional.",10,1
LG,"This phone doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but that's exactly what I wanted and got. If you're looking for a phone that takes great pictures, is simple and straight-forward, and is compact and easy to navigate, this is your product.",141,5
LG,"I have had this phone for almost 4 years and loved it the whole time. I have never wanted a smartphone as I hate touchscreens and love speed and media on my phone.I tried a smartphone once and everything you want to do is based on if you pushed the area just right and it still happens after about a half second later. This is because a ""push"" on a touchscreen is registered once you lift your finger from the screen. So the simple task of dialing a number took me about 15 seconds minimum. On the enV3 I could do it in 4 or 5 seconds.Texting, was of course, a nightmare. They tried to help this by making the phone fill in rest of a word automatically to save time, but it often gets it wrong and I have to spend time deleting and retexting it anyway. Overall, just a hassle in every way. The one thing they do better is internet browsing, but I never need to browse internet when I'm on the go. NEVER. I have a PC at home and I can't think of a single thing I would need to do away from there on the internet.Anyways, with the enV3 I can type as fast as my thumbs can go and don't have to handle it like I'm holding a small computer. It is durable. I must have dropped it hundreds of times over 3 years and only once did it show any damage. That was very recently, which is why I'm here looking for a new one. My old one still works, but one hinge is completely snapped off so its just flopping around.Call sound quality is great. On ear or on speakerphone. No more to be said it has no problems. If you get this phone and it has a problem, you might want to replace it because mine does not.It also has a very good camera for taking pics and videos, I don't use those a whole lot but the pics always look great and videos are a bit laggy, but surprisingly good if you hold it steady. Also, when viewing pictures on the phone, it has an automatic enhancing feature when you zoom in on the pictures. This was amazing to me because I can't find anything on the internet to do this for pictures on my PC, at least not for free.I use mine to listen to music very very much. In the shower I sometimes set it up high on a shelf right near so I can sing along haha. The sound quality while it is open is really good, and only gets bad if there is a lot of bass or many instruments playing loudly all at once, because come on its only stereo and doesn't have any size to make a rumbling bass sound. But most songs you won't even notice this. I doubt any phone does it better anyways as no phone has more than 2 speakers that I know of.I have a 4GB Sandisk Memory Card for mine and it has over 300 songs right now, as well as a few videos and over 50 pictures I took, with over 1.5GB left to spare. I don't plan on filling it up ever, songs don't take much space.After the first 2 years, my phone started slowing down a bit. It's still very fast compared to anything I've seen anyone with, especially any smartphones with touch screens, but it just takes a few more seconds when loading music or when I write an extremely long text(like 100 words or more). Another thing that has gotten worse with age is the battery life. After 2 years it was running out quicker between each full charge. When it was new it would go for well over 5 days day and night with around 20 short calls and around 150 texts of different sizes.These days I have to charge it after 2 or 3 full days, and if I talk on phone for more than an hour straight, it might lose all battery just because of the heat of the phone for some reason. Texting still doesn't bother it much unless I do it nonstop for a half hour or something. Music barely does anything either. I will recommend you DO NOT get a new replacement battery if this happens. I did this and the new battery did the same thing. I think it is just the phone getting old.The last thing I can think of to mention is the interface and menus. I have read other people's reviews all over internet and it seems you either find the menus confusing or you are like me and think they are the best you ever saw in a phone. The main menu can be changed if you want but its default is a grid of 9 pictures that each go to most of the phones features. One goes to messages, one to Web, one to Tools and Options, one to Contact List, you get the picture.Then most other menus are just a list. You can use arrows up and down or just push the number of the option you want to choose on the list. To me this is as simple as can be, but I guess some people find it confusing because there is so much the phone can do, the amount of options becomes overwhelming. Not sure.The backlight is always good and very bright. Hasn't dimmed at all in 3 years. There is internet of some sort but I don't use it because I am not on Verizon, I use Page Plus, so I can't do anything that requires internet since this is a Verizon phone. Also, there's just nothing for me to do. Apparently you could check email and certain sites have a smaller version made for earlier phones, but I wouldn't want to pay for data even if I was on Verizon. What a waste of moolah they are though.Please everyone, check out Page Plus. It is the same signal as Verizon, and you will save a lot. I save $60 a month. WOW. That is just me one single line. If you have a family and are all on Verizon, PLEASE stop wasting your money. I know it sounds impossible but there is actually no downside at ALL. Sorry for the advertising.I bought the phone when it was new straight from Verizon for $300. I know, I was kind of foolish with my money back then, but I still don't regret it because this phone has never let me down and does more than I could have wanted because when I bought it I was just looking for a texting mania phone. The only thing I'm afraid of is that I won't be able to buy enough of these to last me the rest of my life. Sounds crazy, right? But if the way of the future is touch screens or something worse... gulp then what is a guy like me who wants everything to go fast and simple.",74,5
LG,"I got this item very promptly. However when I called verison wireless to activate my new phone it came up as lost or stolen when I gave them the Meid number on the phone. Verizon will not activate the phone ever once this has happened. We will see how the return goes or what they will do to make this right. Will update my review then...The phone was in brand new condition and seemed to function great other than the fact that i could not activate it. So the problem was not on the phones part but on the seller of the phone. I made this purchase through Inventoryplanet , a seller listed on amazon.com. apparently they are not checking the history on the phones that they are selling. what a bummer. Bad business!",11,1
LG,"Ordered product late Thursday nite, recieved Monday morning! Very easy to transfer mobile number, very surprised of the ease of use, picture quality is really good, highly impressed!",35,5
LG,great phone in every category! keep it nice in a case and dont drop too viciously and itll last for years! Very Very pleased.,34,5
LG,No problems. Reliable phone. Purchased this one to replace LG enV3 which had gone swimming in a pool and then was put through the wash.,26,4
LG,"The OEM Shop cannot be trusted... they sent me a phon that said it was ""NEW"" .. when I tried calling Verizon to activate it they said it was still active under another account.. I sent it back... they then offered me a complimentary bluetooth and that never came either!!",25,1
LG,"The phone looks good but when I tried to activate it, Verizon informed me that it is a device that has been reported as STOLEN!!! Verizon rep told me that the consumer should always ask first from the seller what the MEID or ESN # is before purchasing any cell phone then to verify it with the carrier to make sure it is not a hot item. Well, now I know. Should be ZERO star!",23,1
LG,"This is the second phone like this I have had...love it. The flip open keyboard is very convenient for texting and it is way more durable than you would imagine, except it doesn't like water (thats what happened to the first one). Would reccommend this phone to anyone. Great color too.",16,5
LG,I bought one and was tickled. So happy with it that I bought one for my sister. She is tickled.,16,5
LG,"this is my second phone like this one, I bought the original from the actual Verizon store and loved it! My contract wasn't up and the original phone was broken, called Verizon and to replace it I would have had to pay $180. Found this one brand new in the package at a steal of a price! Very pleased with this purchase! The only difference between my original phone and this one was instead of all metal around th frame of it, it was plastic. No biggie! Thanks for the great phone! Worked great with my contract phone, simple phone call got it set up and ready to use!",12,5
LG,I bought the phone refurbished and it looks brand new. It replaced my wife's old work phone that was call/text only. I was able to activate it on Verizon call/text(only) plan using their website. The phone ran one update and functioning as you would expect a basic phone to function. Did notice the speaker phone worked exceptionally well. In-call volume was also good. The touch screen worked good and required a little more presser than the new smart phones but that is to be expected. Overall I gave this product five stars based off the overall look and performance.,25,5
LG,"Used these phones as a basic upgrade prior to our contract renewing. Process for switching through VZ was easy by phone (just don't follow the directions included with the phone (outdated), call customer service).",15,5
LG,I was bummed because Verizon no longer offers this phone. I am not interested in a phone with a data package. I took a chance and ordered this phone a few days ago. I have already received it and am using it already. Just like brand new. I am very satisfied. I was able to activate the phone in about 5 minutes.,12,5
LG,I am only a voice and text person. I am really sorry they do not offer this phone at Verizon any longer.,12,5
LG,I have had a LG Octane cell phone for almost 4 yrs. now and love it. I am not ready fora smart phone yet. I got my son the same phone for his birthday. He has had so many problemswith all of the others. So far he likes it and has not had a problem.,13,5
LG,"I liked the OCTANE LG so much that when I lost it and got it stolen there was no other cell phone I could replace it with in terms of high quality. I received the OCTANE LG many days sooner than promised, and it only took me 10 seconds to activate it. The speaker is very clear and loud. The keyboard is large, sturdy and thick ( not found with other keyboard cells ). It takes good pictures and great 30 sec. videos with clear sounds, plus the battery lasts super long. I dont need internet on my phone, and this phone is the best!",22,5
LG,I like this phone but i noticed there was a little black spec when i used the camera and i tried cleaning the lense still didnt work then i realized it was inside the lense so i called the the number the phone came with and they said well were sorry but we cant do anything about it. I paid 114 bucks for this phone and cant use the camera unless i want a black spec in every picture. also i paid for overnight shipping and i got it 4 days later. I give this phone a 4 star review but the company a -5.,11,4
LG,"Whether you like this phone or not is totally relative to what you've had experience using. If this was my first smartphone I would most likely be satisfied. But I had an HTC rhyme and this is a definite downgrade. The biggest issues I've experienced are 1. There is no indicator light to flash after you've missed a call or text. 2. In the email program on the dashboard there is the capability to view existing folders however no way to move messages from your inbox to folders. You can get around this by opening your email in an internet browser. 3. The autocorrect is really weird and not as intuitive as newer models. That being said, if you're looking for a temporary phone as a replacement until your upgrade renewal period comes as I was, it does the job and I'd rather use this than my rhyme with a cracked screen.",19,2
LG,"Lg Vortex love the phone, works great and been enjoying the phone since I got it. Everything works good nice pictures, love the wifi. Just a great phone all the way round.",19,5
LG,"One of the kids broke my wife's Verizon phone. For the price, this was a great replacement. Much SLOWER and smaller screen than her origional HTC Incredible 2. BUT, if you have ever had to buy a phone while still under contract and tried to do it throught the carrier, you know it would have cost 3 times as much and often for a referbished one. This was much cheaper and with less hassle than using insurance with their outragious deductable. I was warned by Verizon that many phones you buy can not be added to a contract until after 6 months after being purched (to get you in prepaid minutes) This was NOT the case with this phone. Overall, it works fine, does all the pictures, facebook, maps, and internet expected of it.",17,4
LG,I like the technology of the Voyager. THe touch screen is not conducive to my bigger thumbs but if I use the index finger only or open the keyboard.. all goes well! The seller was very prompt in mailing the phone to me... Thank you!,10,4
LG,"I purchased the ""New"" LG Voyager Touch screen phone as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It arrived in a box and appeared to be new. Imagine her disappointment on Christmas day when she activated the phone and it would not work. I had charged the battery fully, and was very familiar with how to work this phone. When you tried to make or receive a call it would simply power down. We called Verizon repeatedly and they checked settings etc. I was told that it was a faulty device and to try to return it if possible. Not only was I shocked, but felt I was completely lied to when Verizon also told me the phone was not new and provided me with the previous account/phone holders phone # and dates of activation. I was promptly credited for the phone return, but will NEVER buy electronics through Amazon again. Buy at your own risk because paying double for a new versus used item obviously means nothing!",34,1
LG,Ordered item for mom's BD and it did not work received 2 defected phones. Had to pay to return 1st phone.,12,1
LG,"I've had this phone for about a week. At first glance, it was so many lightyears better than the free phone T-Mobile had given me that I was overjoyed. Then I noticed some flaws. I'll summarize this as a pros and cons list.PROS - Fabulous reception. The last time I had Verizon it dropped nearly all the calls at my house, so I was taking a big chance switching back because of the phone. Even with 1/2 a bar the connection quality was excellent. I heard everyone much more clearly and everyone noted that they heard me better as well. And, in NY, Verizon has a better overall coverage area, so I was happy. So far, so good.I personally liked the way this phone feels next to my face and in my hand better than either the Chocolate or the Razr, but that's a matter of personal preference. For me the deal-killer with the Chocolate was the lack of speaker phone too.I also like the way the phone book is set up. Everything seems intuitive and well thought out in general.So far, so good, but the cons are a definite annoyance:CONS - 1. Horrible battery life. This phone has a battery life like phones of 5 years ago. You need to charge every night, even on standby. Don't forget to get a car charger and keep it with you with this phone. This is probably the most disappointing thing about this phone, especially compared to the Nokias my friends have.2. Horrible voice-commanded calling. I have yet to get this to work on the first shot. I bought a family plan so my elderly mother could use this - just push a button and say ""call..."" so she could call without having to figure out how to use the phone. I'm sorry that's not going to happen with this phone.3. Iffy speakers - if you make them loud, there is a lot of distortion, but if you put them on medium it's fine.4. Mp3 disabled - this goes under the general Verizon greed issue, but if you go to Ron's review, you'll see how to enable it - and you'll get annoyed when you see right on the phone that the ""mp3 disable"" is checked off. I enabled mine, so far so good.So, if all you need is great reception definitely get this phone. This phone has the best reception of any phone I've had. Judging by other reviews, this isn't the case across the board, but my particular phone gets good reception and has excellent voice clarity on both ends.And, beware, you CANNOT port your number and still get the equipment discount with any service provider on Amazon. However, there is a plus side on the Verizon end. You don't have to get bogged down in a 2 year contract anymore with Amazon either! That was good for me because I wasn't sure about the reception issue. So, I just called and emailed everyone with my new number, which is actualy easier to memorize than the other one was. I wrote this in a review that wasn't published, so lets see if they let this one slip in to this one. If not I'm complaining, because customers should know this before deciding whether to buy.So, overall I am happy with the general things about the phone, but LG needs to address the voice command and battery issues especialy with this model before it will get 5 stars from me. I can live with any other little annoyances.",19,4
Motorola,F**k all those over-rated smart phones!!! This is the best phone ever!! No expensive data plans...no data!!! It MAKES PHONE CALLS...why? because it is a friggin phone. It texts as well. It fits in my pocket with minimal obstruction. Long live the flip phone! Can you update your facebook page with this? NO!!! Get over yourself...no one really cares...you are not that interesting.,11,5
Motorola,"Although this is a old style phone I have had 3 of them over the years. They are easy to use & reliable,& have all the functions I currently need in a cell phone.",11,4
Motorola,"The phone was black in color not Gold as in the photo. It is not a Special Edition. It does not have the red trim or the red in color around the camera with the special ID numbers that is for the Special Edition. On the good side, it is 64G and I have no problem using it with T-Mobile account.",10,2

Motorola,"Great budget phone for the price. The lockscreen ads do not bother me at all. I purchased this phone after testing out the $60 BLU R1 HD with 16 GB storage and 2 GB memory. The BLU actually had a nicer build quality than the Moto G Play, especially the metal sides and curved glass on the front, but the back was very slippery and caused the R1 to slide off surfaces way too easily. The Moto feels lighter and the back battery cover has a softer, more textured feel that is easy to hold and makes the phone less slippery when holding and and when setting down on a surface. I'm not sure which phone I actually prefer since the BLU looked/felt a little nicer, but the Moto is more practical.Besides the minor differences in the look and feel between the BLU R1 HD and the Moto G Play, the real difference is in the software. Even though I wanted to like the BLU, it had too many software bugs. Both phones are snappy and responsive with their 2 GB of memory, but the BLU would randomly open apps, start playing music, or have odd syncing issues with Android Auto that I couldn't resolve. I finally returned the BLU for this Moto G Play and those issues are no longer present. Even though the specs between the two phones are nearly identical, and both have Amazon software installed, the Moto is still going to be much more refined. Also, the rumor is that all the G4 models will receive Nougat which is less likely to see its way to the BLU R1 HD.",12,5
Motorola,"I would highly recommend getting the ad free version (I hear the ad version is annoying). 4 weeks of use, no problems whatsoever. Great battery life. Here are my experiences so far:This phone is:Compatible with Republic wirelessPowerful enough to run most appsA great (really super great) valuea solid stable piece of hardwarea good sizeThis phone is not:a flagship phonea status symbolIf you want a highly functional piece of hardware that works with sprint networks, there is no better option. Go for it if you are looking for a republic wireless compatible phone.",19,5
Motorola,"Ok so I've had this Moto G4 Plus (64GB storage with 4GB RAM) for 24 hours, and so this Isn't going to be a extensive review, just some things I've noticed...First of all, the build and feel of the phone is very good, not super premium like some $600 + phones, but its still very good.the fit is tight and uniform, no gaps around the screen or back cover or anything. the back cover snaps on and off without problems. the phone looks to be very well made.The android system takes up almost 10GB of storage, leaving the user with about 54.5 GB.CPU-Z shows there is 3643 MB of RAMThe buttons for power and volume feel great, make a nice little clicky feel when you push them, and the power button is textured for an easy way to feel the difference between them.the finger print scanner, is very useful, (although it doesn't serve as a button for anything) it wakes the phone up and unlocks it super fast.I would estimate about 1/4 of a second or faster. So far finger print scanner is great, way better than i expected.The screen looks great, full HD 1080P, colors have a warm look to them , the whites are not as blue looking as my Samsung phones screen.IT is a full 5.5 inch display, and yes the buttons are on screen, But can go away in certain apps, to give you the full screen to use, like when watching videos for instance.the sound is very good, although it only has one front facing speaker at the top. it is loud and clear.Call quality has been excellent, and when calling an iphone 6, about two or three feet away, with both phones on speaker. the Moto G4 Plus had no signs of feedback, or echoing, indicating it does an excellent job of noise cancellation. the iphone 6 however sounded like a horror movie.The UI (user interface) is slick and basic android. fast and responsive. the Moto gestures work well as far as the double twist for camera, and the double chop for flashlight. I have not tested the others yet.Supposedly this phone is Water and dust resistant, but i will not be testing that, for obvious reasons.The camera seems to be great so far, low light photos look pretty good, and there is even a pro mode that lets you tweak all the aspects of the camera. if you hold down the shoot button, it takes photos in rapid succession, pretty cool feature.This phone also lets you record slow motion videos which is fun.Some of the cons of this phone i can think of, are:No NFC, not a big deal to me personally, because I never plan on using android pay anytime soon at least, and I never bump my phone to share stuff with other people. I've had NFC on past phones for years, and never used it, except to try it out to see if it worked.No Magnetometer / Compass. I'm not sure of the full implications of not having a compass are, but GPS and navigation still work, because they rely on the GPS sensors, this phone also uses GLONASS, which is just the Russian version of the United states GPS system, twice as many satellites, means twice the reliability, and more accurate and faster positioning.Since there is no Compass, google sky map will not work correctly, which is big bummer for me.ON THE OVER HEATING ISSUE:I live in south Texas, and tested this phone outside with the camera app, taking dozens of photos and using CPU-Z i never noticed temps over 55 C on any of the sensors, most were about 50 C or below. also the camera app never started lagging and stuttering.I will update this review if anything changes, and after a month or two when i have spent more time with the phone.EDIT: after using this phone for 4 days now. I bumped it from a 4 to a 5 star. The battery life is very good. And easily last all day. In fact I've had the phone with me at work now since 7 am this morning, using it off and on pretty often. It is now 2:30 pm and I still have 70% left. Pretty impressive.The screen looks great in full sun with full brightness setting, no problems at all.The more I use this phone the more I like it.",524,5
Motorola,"MOTO G (4th Gen) Plus - 64gb version. (My old phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 4).2 Week Update.Screen: The resolution is excellent. It is full HD and compares well to my Note 4. I played with a Note 5 over the 4th and the screen resolution of that is the same. Yes the Notes have 1440 x 2560 resolution vs the Moto G4s 1080 x 1920 but on a 5.5 inch screen it does not matter. MOTO has a DPI of 401 which makes the difference unnoticeable.Screen Size. The MOTO G4 has a 5.25 inch screen. They list a 5.5 but as the buttons are on the screen you lose .25 inches of screen that you don't on other phones that have physical buttons in the boarder'. I have found that these disappear when in apps so you get the space back and a simple swipe up brings them back.Android: Version 6.01. This is as close to stock Android which is a plus. There is no bloatware that I could find. It would be great if it was stock android but it is really tough to get a good stock android phone. I am hoping that since it is close to stock that updates will come in a timely fashion. Samsung is the worst for updates. If you have the latest flagship phone from Samsung you will be lucky if you get the latest android updates after every other company has updated their phones. Then you have to wait on the carriers who are just as bad. If you have a phone like my Samsung Note 4 good luck getting updates. I am hoping MOTO is better at putting out updates but really don't know. You at least get rid of 1 level by taking out the carrier updates.Battery: I set the phone up and was using it 100% of the time from about 4:30pm to after midnight and ran the phone down. I then forgot to plug it in over night and it lost almost no power over night 18% down to 13%. Charging with included turbo charger: 30 Mins it went from 13% to 47%. At 1 hour it was at 88%. it hit 100% at 1 hour 40 mins.After 3 days I would say the battery life is not the best. If you don't use it it will last forever. My Samsung Note 4 would be way down with minimal use. It goes down alot faster with use. From 7:30 AM to midnight it went from 100% down to 15%. Most of that when I started using it after work. I am still playing with settings so this will also be updated. 7:30 to 3:30 I am down to 80% from a full charge.Update: I have gone through a number of full battery cycle and the battery seems to be holding up well. I got a day and a half on my last full battery and today I have 66% left from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm. I am happy if it lasts a day as I will always charge it overnight. I just don;t want to be on empty at the end of the day and the last few days seem to be holding up. I still have not tried to optimize anything.After 2 weeks of use I find I have no issues with battery life. I am very happy with it.Storage. Android OS on the Moto G4 plus takes 9.49 GB so a 16GB phone is no longer an option. It really has never been and option. If you are looking at the 16GB version of the MOTO G4 or the plus keep looking. This goes for any Android phone. The upgrade to 64gb was only $50 and included an upgrade of memory from 2gb to 4gb. It is well worth it. Unlike Apple and Samsung who seem to think you should bend over to have a storage upgrade Motorola comes in with a better price.Micro SD: I added 128gb card to store music on and it works great. I have read and suspect it supports up to 256 but those are still cost prohibitive.Finger Print Sensor: The plus has a finger print sensor that works beautifully. I have 2 other devices that have finger print sensors. The Note 4 who's finger print sensor was very poor and was unusable and the Galaxy Tab S2 8"" which seems to function ok. I have had no issue with the MOTO G4 finger print scanner and would rate it superior to either of the Samsung versions I have.App performance: Everything is very smooth and snappy. At this point the OCTACore processor and touch of the screen are excellent. We have gotten to the point when phone CPUs have outpaced need for 95% of the public maybe even 100%. I don't play high entensity 3d games and those might be an issue but I cannot report on that as everything I use works great.WIFI Performance: This works fine. I was getting 50mb a second download off my AC2350 netgear router. Wired I get 130mb second. Once again overkill. I get the same rate from my Samsung Galaxy tab S2 and it supports AC.Look and feel: The size is great. Just a little smaller in your hand than the Note 4 but it makes a lot of difference. I have smaller hands and was always fumbling with the note 4. The MOTO G seems much more natural.No NFC so no Android pay. I still see absolutely no reason to use android pay so it is not a big deal to me. I either have to get my phone out and make the payment or I have to get out my wallet and make the payment. Not a lot of difference. They tried to solve a problem that didn't exist. I guess they assume we are all so consumed with with our online presence that our phone is always in our hands. If you are in line using your phone the person behind you should smack it out of your hands for being rude.Blutooth: Connected a earbud and my PC. Both function fine with no issues.Pokemon Go. Runs fine. seems to have the same issues as my son and daughters iphone 6 and 6s and my old Samsung Note 4. It is a battery hog on all phones and has to be restarted every once in a while. These are common to all 4 phones though.Pros.Price: At 299 the 64GB Moto G Plus (4th Gen) is a steal. It Compares to at least last years flag ship models.Storage:. 64gb is enough for most but if not you can add 128gb micro SD.Screen: Crystal Clear screen very responsiveSetup: Very easy to setup and install apps from prior phoneApps: Run perfectly well with no slow downs. .ConsScreen size of 5.25. Finger print scanner is not the home button and you waste .25"" of screen for the 3 buttons.Speak is a little tinny. Fine for voice calls but you would never want to listen to music over it. earbuds are good and you can always get a set of bluetooth speackers.After 2 weeks I see no reason to buy a Galaxy Note 7 or Iphone 7 for $700 to $800. You are basically paying $500 for less storage, to go from a Great phone camera to the best phone camera and to get NFC. My daughter who is an Apple iLemming even liked it. After using it for a week I gave my wife my Note 4 to upgrade her note 2. This phone is great and I would definitely look at the next one when I need a new phone in a few years.Update 9/16/2016: I still think this is a great phone and am happy with my purchase. Much better than spending 700+ on an exploding galaxy note 7. It does get warm when playing pokemon go and charging at the same time. Other than that I really have no complaints. I do think we will see an explosion of 200-300 phones over the next year as people realize that while the flagship lines have better processors those processors are more than they need. Its like the PC market. Unless you play heavy duty online games, a $400 computer is the same as a $1000+ computer.",339,5
Motorola,"After 4 days of continuous use, I really like this phone. You get a great amount of storage, a good quality screen and performance. I am by no means a hardcore, mobile phone gamer. The most taxing game I play is Fallout Shelter and The Wolf Among Us and this phone loads and plays them without a hitch. The rest includes streaming music and playing it over Bluetooth at home or in the car, watching YouTube Amazon and Netflix videos. Of course I, also talk on the phone and use turn by turn navigation, often. No problems with call quality, ringer and speaker volume, or with wifi or cellular connections or stability. Over the past 3 years this is my 4th mobile. I also currently own a Motorola Moto X Style Pure edition 2015. It's in the pics for a size comparison. The Moto X ran me $500 last year and the Moto G4 Plus set me back $325 after some customization at Moto maker. I like the G4 Plus almost as much as the Moto X, but the X wins on style (G4 is really plain looking) and screen quality. However for $175 less, the G4 is a great value. Nice rapid charging too. More to come in a few weeks. Enjoy the pics.",131,4
Motorola,"Great phone so far!Responsive with no visible lag, fingerprint reader is reliable (100% recognition so far!), and sound seems fairly clear. Camera starts up quick, but I haven't really pushed the camera through its paces. The wife adores it, and plays Pokemon Go non-stop with no stuttering, lag, or overheating so far.Will update after more use!",10,5
Motorola,"Like many others I had trouble activating this phone with Verizon. I now have AT&T via Tracfone.The USB charging cord is difficult to get on and very difficult to get off. Motorola sent a 2"" replacement cord that also did not fit properly and it is way too short to be of any use even if it did fit (the cord that it comes with is 2 FEET). Using either cord would quickly damage the phone. It does not fit snug against the phone like in the picture either. I have not used the phone enough to really review everything, but it's not off to a good start. Has anyone else had the problem with the cord not fitting properly?If they send a phone with the same problem I'm done. The fact that Motorola sent a 2 INCH cord to replace a 2 FOOT cord does not give me confidence in Motorola. This was my first Motorola phone and may be my last.Update ... I now have the replacement phone and the charging cord is still more difficult to put in and take out than any phone I've ever had. The cord on my old phone fits great so I'm not sure what the problem is. I have also noticed that the ports on the 2 Moto G4 phones do not look the same. You can see two metal ""dots"" in one that are not visible in the other. I don't know what this means, but I would prefer consistency ... clearly something is off. I haven't decided if I will just keep the phone and use my own cord or go through the hassle of returning both and finding another phone.",10,1
Motorola,"This is my 4th budget Moto smartphone. I've owned and used the Moto g1 as well as the 1st and 2nd gen Moto E. The Moto G4 is far superior to all of those but it doesn't have the same magic that the original Moto G had.I really think that Google took over Motorola and made the Moto G1 with the main intention of making the company more appealing to sell. Google sold Motorola for a very good profit to Lenovo shortly after the great success of the Moto G. I still have my Moto G1 and very much cherish that phone for it's great features and excellent build quality.I purchased the Moto G4 with 64gig hd and 4 gig of RAM so that I wouldn't need to worry about space for my apps. Converting micro SD cards as internal storage in Marshmellow doesn't work as well as it should. Apps need to be supported for this feature and only a handful in the app store seem to be. Plus only very high speed memory cards will work properly. All three of my class 10 cards by PNY, Sandisk, and Lexar get a warning stating that they are too slow when I try to make them part of the internal storage. The screen is sharp although I prefer the look of the 5.5 inch 1080p IPS screen on the iPhone 6plus. I don't know what it is but the screen on the Moto G just doesn't have the same vibrancy or quality. Still, the Motor G4 screen is plenty bright and nice to look at.The front facing speaker sounds great and buttons feel mostly responsive when pressed. The fingerprint scanner works better than any other phone I've tried.Turbo charging is also a great feature that I couldn't live without especially since I usually have to charge the Moto G4 in the afternoon to comfortably get through the evening. I've been getting about 4 hours of screen on time between charges. The camera takes decent pictures and focuses quickly. Most everything on this phone is really nice and snappy. NFC might be a feature some will miss, not me though.Even though to me the Moto G4 doesn't make me giddy like the orifinal Moto G, my opninion is that you can't go wrong with this purchase. The Moto G4 really is a good phone for someone who needs a device that works well, has the important premium features, and doesn't break the bank.",11,5
Motorola,"Great phone, Nice size, feels good to hold, big screen and clear, sharp resolution. Very fast and with the 64 GB internal storage and 128 GB SD card, it is almost endless storage. The 4GB RAM makes for fast easy browsing. I would match this phone with the $700 -$1,000 models any day. The camera seems to be excellent, however I have not used it enough yet to pass judgement. I will comment later on the camera.",11,5
Motorola,"Ok, I love this phone. I recently destroyed my Samsung Galaxy S5 and needed a replacement. I didn't like the S6 and didn't want to commit to another 2 year contract for the S7. Then I found this little guy. Oh, man! I've had it for about a week now and I still love it. Battery life is great and recharges quickly when depleted. I love the camera, the slow motion video, the ""expert camera"" mode. You know what else I love? I love that the FM radio receiver (which all smart phones have) is not disabled. I can listen to FM radio without using an app that uses data like Iheartradio or something would use. True, it's only local stations, but that's not the point. The point is that the manufacturers include a radio in your phone that your carrier decides to disable to protect their monopoly on your data. Here's another good thing about this phone: it's unlocked. So you can use it on whatever carrier you want. Take it abroad, use it in a different country just by switching SIM cards. How can you not get behind that?My wife uses a Samsung Galaxy Note3 and she loves it. But when it gets time to replace it she's going with one of these babies because she sees how much I enjoy it. She may not appreciate all the technical advantages this phone has over others, but she does like the looks, form factor and interface. In short, it's a joy to use.",35,5
Motorola,"I have been waiting for years for the inevitable moment when my continual exposure to the microwave radiation emanated by cell phones will give me super powers.Sadly, that moment has not come.HOWEVERI live in a somewhat remote area. My Samsung Galaxy S5 would frequently lose signal along my road, and I would get a bar or possibly two while at my house. I had the same problem with the Galaxy S4. Ever since I have purchased the Motorola G4 plus, I haven't lost signal once, and I have almost full bars everywhere in my service area.I did some pretty exhaustive research on unlocked phones, and which models would have the strongest antennas and radios. As was my experience back in the pre Android days, Motorola makes a solid device, and I can see that this trend has continued. I am very pleased with the UI and the general features of the phone, but I have to say that, as a person who has had a difficult time holding a conversation from his house, this phone is a godsend.The absolutely cavernous onboard storage and big fat chunk of memory (4GB; double the normal 2GB) made it an easy choice over the Nexus phones. The fact that I was able to bring my phone up to 128 gigabytes with the addition of a 64 gigabyte SD card was just icing on the cake.The only real detractor is that now I can't ignore my boss's phone calls and claimed I didn't have signal. So....yeah.",30,5
Motorola,"Having previously owned an LG G4 ($450), I will try not to be too harsh on Lenovoƒ??s Moto G4 Plus (64GB), which costs a full $150 less with double the storage and an extra 1GB of RAM.Camera:I have found the rear camera is slightly better than that of a Galaxy S4. The LG G4 had far and away a better camera (featuring OIS), but for the price, the Moto G4 camera is satisfactory. You must hold the device very still or the picture may come out blurry in anything besides broad daylight. Daylight pictures are good, but dark blacks seem to get muddled together. Nothing toying with the brightness and contrast won't fix.Performance:Could not ask for better for the price. I use my phone for texting, music, calling, videos, and web browsing and the Moto G4 Plus has delivered responsive, liquid smooth performance. Stutter is introduced when scrolling heavy webpages, but I have yet to not experience this on a mobile device. The 4GB of RAM definitely makes a difference while multitasking.Sound:Audio via Bluetooth and the headphone jack is on par with that of my other smartphones, if not better. Bluetooth connects very quickly. The headphone jack makes electrical sounds when inserting a plug, so donƒ??t let that startle you. I really like the front-facing speaker, calls are loud and clear. It does distort with some loud ringtones, but I have yet to encounter any distortion with playing music.Headphones are not included with the G4 Plus.Display:The 1080p 5.5ƒ? display is great. I will always miss AMOLED, but the Moto G4ƒ??s TFT LCD rivals the LG G4ƒ??s QHD IPS LCD display in every aspect except pixel density.Touch is very responsive and accurate.Heating Issue:I have not used the camera for long periods of time (more than 2 minutes), but so far, I have not experienced any issue with heat. The only time I have experienced any heat from the phone is when I had the screen on for hours while downloading apps and charging at the same time, and even then it was not uncomfortably hot, just warm.Other Hardware:The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick and accurate and the physical buttons feel very good. I would expect them to be found on a $700 device.Overall build quality is great for the price, it feels more solid than the LG G4.While not curved like the LG G4, it sits well in the hand and does not feel too huge in the pocket.After allowing the battery life to settle in, I can make it a whole day without going below 50%, which is excellent.Other Software:Marshmallow is very slick and packed full of neat animations and features. While not 100% vanilla, this version of Android is very close, providing a familiar experience. I find myself amazed at how far every version of Android has come since the days of Gingerbread.There are not many tweaks available out of the box, cosmetic or otherwise. You canƒ??t even change/add/move the softkeys, which is disappointing.Rooting looks intimidating with this device, but once you think through it, it is actually incredibly quick and easy depending on which method you use.Xposed needs to be manually flashed (I have v85 working), and GravityBox provides many useful tweaks which seem to be working so far. I am also using Nova Launcher to gain some more launcher features. Having used Cyanogenmod in the past, Iƒ??m satisfied with just GravityBox and Nova on this device.FoxFiƒ??s wifi hotspot crashes the device, but USB tethering works just fine (make sure you are in MTP or PDANet Desktop will show an unhelpful error).One annoying ƒ??featureƒ? is that the G4 Plus always connects to any PC in ƒ??chargingƒ? mode, not MTP. I have to manually switch to MTP every time. Hopefully there is a way to make MTP the default, but I havenƒ??t found it yet.After a week of use, I am really enjoying this device. I have a hard time believing this phone was only $299. It blows my $450 LG G4 away in nearly every respect except camera quality.",28,5
Motorola,"I owe Amazon an apology for returning two of these phones upon the advice of ""techs?"" at the ATT Corporate store. When I got the first phone, I noticed that after turning it on, my SIM card would just disappear after exactly one hour. A reboot would bring the card back and it would disappear again after one hour exactly. The ATT store gave me a brand new SIM card and it did the same thing as the old card. Also the two cards I tried worked perfectly in my MOTO E which I was replacing. The aforementioned techs said that the card reader on the phone was defective, so I asked for a replacement.Amazon immediately sent me a replacement and the same problem was present. After one hour exactly the SIM card which was working in my MOTO E disappeared. I gave up and returned the second phone. I purchased the same phone from another online retailer thinking Amazon got a bad batch. The third phone did the same thing as the first two.I took the problem to Motorola and after no help at the lower level, they gave me the number of a Level 3 tech, the really smart people. He told me that the ATT tower software was kicking me off their network because I had an unlocked phone. He told me to go back to the corporate store and have them put my SIM card in an ATT branded phone until it was recognized, which took about three minutes. Then I put the card back in my unlocked Moto G and it has been solid for two weeks. The MOTO tech said ATT software doesn't play nice with unlocked phones, but this method would fix it.Anyway, I really like this phone and was determined to get it working. My wife likes it so much that I ordered another one from Amazon for her. It has amazing storage capacity and a kick butt 16MP camera. There is as much bang to the buck with this phone as those costing twice as much. I highly recommend this phone and if anyone should have the SIM card problem, the fix is simple.",21,5
Motorola,"Lost GPS signal when 3G connection is working or during a call. The phone is shutting off with 55-50% battery. The photo image has some lines when I took a photo and the camera is shutting off the phone while a took a video. Sometimes I'm getting a ""ghost touch"". Moto Support doesn't response my forums",13,1
Motorola,"My Moto G plus is going back (received it yesterday)....Gets heated up right around the front Top section. Also the sound via the headphone is poor. My $30 Lumia 540 gives me better sound via headphone. I tested using the same headphone. The heating issue was mentioned mostly in Asian Forum where the phone was released earlier. I noticed the same thing also also if you receive call after surfing or playing games, you can't talk properly because the hot part of the phone will touch your ear. Everything else works perfect. Screen is nice, Ample storage options. Fingerprint sensor works flawlessly and better than iphone 6s plus. Unfortunately, I can't deal with a phone which has heating issues and poor sound quality.",13,3
Motorola,"Never been as impressed with a phone at this price point before. This phone easily compares to my previous phone- Nexus 6P. And it is cheaper. The moto g4 plus is impressive to say the least. I was sold on the 4gb RAM and 64gb internal memory w/ SD card slot expandability for 300$. Will see if it continues to impress.Comes with nano sim card adapter also, but i didnt need it. I just put in my microSIM and off I went! Fingerprint scanner works flawlessly, easy setup. Love it!Battery isnt removable it seems but that doesnt matter to me. Speakers on front are pretty good. No issues with LTE connectivity or anything. I had a Huawei honor 5x for a few days after I lost my Nexus 6P and I returned the huawei 5x because of poor data connection and got this.",13,5
Motorola,"Traded in a Samsung Galaxy 4 for this, and I love it. Features galore, AND unlocked. I took it to Verizon (my US carrier) and got it activated on their network. Then on a European trip, I took it to a Three store, slid in an Irish SIM and it worked beautifully. Same in the UK. I was able to use local SIMs in the same phone and didn't even lose any of my apps. No more roaming charges.",13,5
Motorola,"This is really a nice phone with a great screen, little software bloat, decent camera for the price of the phone, pretty good battery life, & fast charging. Overall, I'd rate it a very good value.The reason I'm not giving it more stars is that it lacks a compass. Give me a break, what would a magnetometer cost? $1?I'm talking about uses beyond a simply app with a compass rose. Walk out of a subway in an unfamiliar city with Google Maps of the city showing on your phone. Which direction should you be walking to get to your destination? You could track yourself walking in one direction to see if you are tracking in the direction you want to go.Of course if the phone has a compass function, Google Maps will display your orientation on the map so you instantly know which way to walk. Same with navigation.My cheapo LG Sunset (on Tracfone) has a compass, so I expect one on all phones these days. This one went back. Sigh...",20,3
Motorola,"I'm not sure what is going on, but all of a sudden the screen goes crazy and flips between several different apps!!! I asked for a replacement because I thought maybe it was just something happening with the first one I got. I am on my second one within a month and now the second phone is doing the same thing!!!",18,1
Motorola,"Let me say that my initial response to this phone was great. I thought Motorola had an affordable phone with a lot to offer. The performance was great to begin with but soon dropped.....a lot. Keep in mind I have only had the phone for a month. Every single app that I close out of says ""Unfortunately, *app name* is not responding"". Then it gives the option to report the issue or just say OK. It was an infrequent occurrence at first but now its all the time. There was time when my phone said ""Android UI is not responding""......pretty ridiculous if you ask me. The only fix I've found is to shut the phone down for a little while and start it back up, usually that gives a decent amount of screen time. Also, my phone operates extremely poor once the battery falls below 30%, which isn't a low amount of battery. And when I try to operate the device while being charged it's extremely sporadic. I'm not saying this is a common problem and am here to bash Motorola for this piece of junk I received, I'm just telling my experience. I'd like to give my review of this phone's specs but so far I haven't had the chance to try them out since I had about a full week in proper working condition. Not to mention some of the clips on the back cover snapped off when I was taking my SIM card out to place it into another phone. Not real impressed.",17,2
Motorola,"Awesome beast of a phone!! I am more than pleased with the Moto G4 Plus so far and it is not as big as I feared (though I would never call it small, especially to its face). For the price, I just don't see how you can find a better end user experience. The OS is speedy, the camera is more than capable, comes with almost zero bloatware, and probably has more storage space than I'll ever need. I paid for the 64 GB version because I wanted the 4 GB RAM to help ensure I don't have issues with lag both now and down the road, and the extra $ seems to be totally worth it.",15,5
Motorola,"I had such high hopes when this device was announced, but after four hours of use, i will be returning it. It feels cheap in the hand, like really cheap. I removed the back cover to place a sim and sd card in the phone, now the lower left corner of the back cover doesn't stay on, making a constant taping sound when ever I use the phone. The screen sits just below the bezel, and it drives me nuts. The camera is mediocre at best. Using it is a chore, the device is slow and not very responsive, animations are glitchy and slow. The screen is bright and has good color, but icons and text are soft and fuzzy. I have only used motorola handsets since I moved to android, and this by far is the most disappointing version of a Moto phone.I was hoping to replace my 2nd gen Moto X with this phone. The dual sim and expandable storage were enticing features as well as a bigger screen a battery life, but after my short time with this phone I have come to the conclusion that this device is no better than the 1st generation Moto X.",15,2
Motorola,"My mistake: I had assumed this phone was an evolution of the original?ÿMotorola MOTO G (1st Gen) ?ÿand I took for granted that it included all the basic features of that phone (""Plus"" more). My biggest disappointment: it doesn't include a magnetometer/compass like most smartphones (including the original Moto G).Without the magnetometer/compass feature, Google Maps can't help pedestrians orient themselves by holding up the phone and turning around... Likewise, apps like Pokemon Go won't work in ""Augmented Reality"" mode (showing virtual objects in the context of the real world).So, while this is a perfectly good smartphone that works well as advertised, it lacks what I had considered a standard feature of smartphones dating back to the original iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S: the magnetometer. I assume this is a Lenovo design with the Moto G branding slapped onto it - it also lacks the solid feel and design elegance of previous Moto models.Edit: October 25, 1016 - since I've purchased this I've decided I don't miss the magnetometer all that much and I've discovered that automobile navigation really doesn't suffer from the skimpy hardware. Also, Moto/Lenovo makes it easy to unlock the phone's bootloader to take advantage of a few (as of yet unofficial) builds of popular Android ROMs like CyanogenMod. The dev community on XDA is growing for this device... So, I've bumped my rating from 3 to 4 stars.",16,4
Motorola,"I noticed the MOTO G PLUS in the prime days advertising. The OCTA CORE processor captivated me. After researching the processor it is true that there is no specific programs for 8 cores, The SNAP DRAGON PROCESSOR uses one quad core for low power programs and one for high power programs. Low power uses such as phone calls are routed through one quad core and gaming is routed through a high power core. the phone calls are clear and the games play well. I find the camera exceptionally capable and the HD features clear. I have not tried out all of the features, but there are so many. So far so good.",16,5
Motorola,"This is the first android phone that I've ever purchased. Have been using iPhone for the past many years. Both myself and my girlfriend. I wanted to updated her phone. Initially was trying to get her the Vivo Blu 5 but it's been out of stock for the past many weeks. Her phone arrived yesterday and just let me say I've already ordered another one for myself which is on the way. I played with her phone a bit to help with the setup since I'm the more techy one. The phone is great, super fast. I messed with it for hours and it did not get hot. My iPhone is actually warmer than this. She likes the camera, the only thing we could not figure out was where the pictures got stored. Did not know with android you can download any gallery app you want to browse your picture since we are so used to the iPhone. I tested the download speed of huge files and it's super fast, I'm very surprised. The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast, works every time. You can also use the reader to make purchases in the play store. The reader also activate the home buttons when full screen is running. The phone was already updated when recieved. I thought I would order the one plus 3 for myself but after experiencing hers I was like there is no need. This phone is fully loaded. Paid 299 with a 50 dollar gift card so the actual price is 249 for 64 gigs and 4ram. The phone did not come with any unneeded apps. Oh yea one more thing to add is I'm located in Germany with the armed forces and it works great. Amazon would not ship the black one to my military address so I ordered the white one instead. I'm excited about this phone. Will be watching lots of android videos to get some tips for more ideas to operate it. My only concern is that it does not come with a magnetic compas sensor which my old iPhone had. Not sure what I won't be able to do without the sensor. The phone does not come with ear phone. My girlfriend did not care since we have so many around the house. Another thing to add is the speakers sound great and it's loud. It's in the front of the phone and it sound 3Dish or stereo. I've not used the fm radio, will try that today. The phone did not come with a case nor a scratch protector. I did order these things when ordering the phone but it's not yet here. My girlfriend was amazed how light it is. Much lighter than our iPhones. She likes the feel to it but it's kind of slippery without the case. She won't be using it fully yet until the case arrives in dear of our kids getting a hold of it and dropping. That's all I can think of for now. Great phone at a great price. I also ordered the Blu r1 for my daughters birthday. Will review when she opens it next week. Another thing to add for the Moto gplus, I thought it was made in India, the box says China, it also doesn't have manufactured date on the box which I would have liked. You can add multiple fingerprints on the reader.Update:-I figured out that it did have a photo Gallery-The net is much faster on here than on my iphone with using the same SIM Card (its always connected to 4G) No LTE in my part of Germany yet.-The phone heated up one time and that was when we played a high powered game for a long time. I've played other games for hours and it stayed cool. The heat wasn't disturbing though, I was only looking for it because of all the reviews.-We now have 2, one for me and the other for my girlfriend, they both work the same.-Fingerprint reader is so fast, I enabled the option with my banks app and its perfect. I kind of see why it was not a good idea to bring back to the home screen.-Phone calls can sound like its on speaker phone if volume is not low enough.-Volume control on the side is driving me nuts, moving it will automatically adjust the volume for the ringtone by default, I only want it to control media. Then again this is my first android on my iphone I could lock the speaker volume.-GPS was not working, I disabled location services and turned it back on and GPS started to work, the signal is so strong and fast. Navigation works any and everywhere.-Downloaded a lot and so much more space left",98,5
Motorola,I was in love with this phone until yesterday which was October 28th 2016. I receive the phone October 14th 2016. This phone is excellent as long as it has no bugs in it. What ended up happening is that the phone started flipping from screen to screen and it becomes uncontrollable and is extremely difficult to power down when it is in that mode. It is extremely frustrating and I cannot recommend this phone to anyone. I have not called the manufacturer to utilize and warranty since I am within the 30 days of purchasing this device from Amazon. Those down I am going back to my LG V10. Good luck for those who choose this phone. It is an extreme nightmare. I will say this the battery life is excellent and the picture quality is also excellent. The use of is with all the apps is great until you run into that bug. Motorola should be ashamed of themselves for making such a device.,10,1
Motorola,"This phone sounded like a dream come true. 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal memory, with expandable memory. Long battery life, fingerprint reader, and best of all affordable.I was very excited to have this phone, I even pre-ordered it. So essentially, I've had the phone since it has released.Now, remember those features we've all been wanting in an affordable smart phone? Let's talk about them 2 months into owning this phone.Processing speed:This phone is not the speediest, although I knew this when I purchased the phone. I was expecting to have lag and stutter on the phone every now and then, especially for demanding applications. I found this phone struggling way too often, with apps like Snapchat and Chrome. I came from a Nexus 5, and the performance that I was getting was about the same, in some cases worst. Although, when it comes to things like messages, phone calls, and less demanding apps like Twitter, it ran without hiccups. Again, it's important to take the phone price into consideration, but I'm pointing out performance because that 4GB of RAM is not helping too much.Fingerprint reader:The fingerprint reader works OKAY. When I made a profile for my thumb to be able to unlock the phone, the process was painless. Although when it came to unlocking my phone, it frequently didn't registered my thumb. I would try different positions but no luck. What I did to remedy this was make different profiles of the same thumb. This way, it allowed for more ways for my thumb to be positioned. It worked, but then another problem came up. The fingerprint reader is positioned in a spot where it gets a lot of finger time, so it tends to get a bit smudgy, and I often have to wipe the fingerprint reader for it to read my finger. I've asked others about their fingerprint scanners on their phones such as iPhones and LG phones, and that issue isn't as common. Although, those are $600 devices.Camera:The camera is OKAY. I couldn't imagine what the non plus model camera is like. It takes awesome pictures if the lighting is great and the objects aren't moving. It does take pictures VERY slowly, especially with HDR on. One thing that is inconvenient about the phone is that it zooms in a little when recording video. Another is that when it comes to Snapchat video, it performs AWFULLY. The video playback runs extremely choppy.Battery life:The battery life is really, really great. With light-to-moderate use, it gets a full 7am-10pm charge, the battery takes about 1.25 hours to charge from 0% to 100%.DEAL BREAKING ISSUE:The phone recently started to have some major issues, it shuts off randomly when the battery is below about 60%. Let's say I'm at a concert, and I want to take a picture, if the phone is at 50%, as soon as I open either snapchat or the camera app, it just shuts off. When the percentage is lower, the problem gets worse. At about 25%, I've had the phone shut off when I open my regular apps such as twitter or Google Maps. This has been a huge headache and has ruined the phone experience for me.I've submitted for a replacement, and hopefully these issues don't exist anymore, but until then, my review will stay like this.",43,3
Motorola,"I've had this phone for a few months now, and I'm very satisfied. I was using a Moto X with Republic Wireless, and they recently upgraded their plans and made several phones available to use on their system. Since Amazon's price was better than buying it directly from Republic, I purchased it here. Republic's 3.0 plans make use of T-Mobile's GSM network, which has been up and down for me. Their 2.0 plans used the Sprint network, and in my immediate area, they seem to have better coverage than T-Mobile. Wi-Fi calling is a plus to help with any signal issues. Since the phone is unlocked, it can be used on almost any carrier. The 5.5'' screen dwarfs the Moto X I was using. Even though the 64GB of storage is plenty for now, I added a 128GB micro SD card. The 16MP camera works well for me, even in low-light situations.To me, the best features are the fingerprint sensor and the turbo charger. It can go from <5% to 100% in around an hour. The battery holds a charge very well too.",13,5
Motorola,"I got this last July, loved the phone btw. Recently the phone randomly stop charging, so I dis/reconnect it. That fixed, but now that doesn't work anymore, I've gone through 3 different wires which worked for 2 charges then stopped working again, googled the problem, turned out its the charging dock, so I went to the Motorola website to get it fixed since I'm still covered by the warranty... is what I thought but them a$$holes are charging me $75 to get it fixed, I've had the phone for 3 months, 3!!! Months!!! WTF happened to ""we stand by our products"" Motorola?",20,1
Motorola,"Update: everything was fine untill i started using the camera on this phone when i went outing. I wasnt able to take video for more than 5 mins, it got sooo hot and stuck, wasnt able to use the phone untill the temperature dropped. Tried 3 times using the camera under diff circumstances, it gets stuck whenever it gets hot, totally unusable, Just returned it.! Disappointment from motorola/lenovo!#######Fingerprint sensor is very cool and works everytime perfectly! Performance is optimum and though its weightless, feels little chunkier than expected. Over all a great buy for $250(Amazon limited time deal $50 off with NO ads) - 64GB , 4GB RAM.",17,1
Motorola,"Amazon somehow shipped this to me 4 days early.I'm an Android developer and have access to a ton of phones. I'm coming from a nexus 5x which well had a few terrible bugs (muting conference calls wtf) and terrible battery life. This z play is a revelation. It's blazingly fast compared to the 5x. It feels faster even though 8 x a53 cores shouldn't be faster. I have a s7 for work and it feels no slower. The build is great and feels at least as nice as day a Samsung s6/s7. Our Google pixel phones came today as well and honestly this feels as fast and build wise more expensive. The battery life is amazing too. Maybe losing 5% after surfing the web for an hour is pretty special.The price is a bit more than Motorola's last gen. I had a 2015 moto x ..... And this is just a better phone than that. Faster, and nicer materials and amoled. What a difference a year makes.",75,5
Motorola,"This device is just what I needed. This phone is pretty much an exchange for the Moto G4 Plus. The old saying, you get what you pay for is true. I paid roughly $150 more for this one and it was well worth it. The G4 Plus is a great phone missing one key feature for me which is NFC. What you get in return for in the Moto Z Play is a ton of battery life, AMOLED display, and a top of the line build quality. There is one caveat of losing one (1) GB of RAM, however by the performance of both devices side by side, you would never notice. If you are on the fence between the G4 Plus and the Moto Z Play I say get the Moto Z play. You can't go wrong with either as these are Premium Mid-range devices. If NFC for android pay isn't important to you, save yourself some cash. Either way Lenovo/Motorola have some hits on their hands.",11,5
Motorola,"Pre-ordered and get it today (Oct 20). I was a Samsung s7 user.First feel:1. There is a wooden case come with the order, which I assume is a gift for pre-orders. I bought a Nylon case on Moto's website and personally prefer that feeling. However, there is a little bit shake between the case and the phone. Normally you would not notice it, but if you are an OCD like me just don't case.2. There is nothing to complain about the smooth. Snapdragon 625 is good enough for daily use (thanks for 14nm I guess), and I didn't feel heat at all (compared to my Snapdragon 820 S7). And I don't play games.3. Battery seems to be perfect. Will add more details later.Drawbacks:Type-C ! At first I think it is an advantage, but turns out it's a nightmare. The original package contains a charger and cable combo, which means you have to buy a new Type-C cable yourself in order to make data transfer (and I'm an android auto user). The cable is not on Moto's website and you have to find one on amazon. However, you have to choose carefully! Not all type-c cables will work for this phone, only the ones in good qualities will. I used to have two type-c cables for my type-c mobile battery, which are all not working for the phone.May add more in future.",26,5
Motorola,"I've only been using this device for a few days so I may add to this. I come from the OG Moto X 2013 and 2nd gen Moto X 2014, passing on the Moto X 2015 Pure (although I may order that while it's reasonably priced). The Moto Z Play is a very well built device. Great attention to detail, the Mod concept is interesting, but the jury is still out in my opinion. The shell back however seems to work fine even for someone that may never buy one of the overpriced other Mods. Batter is incredible, Wifi connectivity is flawless, radio signal is very good even in places that were previously a problem for the Moto X 2014. All in all an excellent device.Now for the not so good: It's a bulky, fairly heavy device, with the metal sides incredibly smooth, meaning slippery. I am concerned this device will be slipping through my fingers in the near future..hopefully on a soft ground. This can be remedied maybe with a case that covers the sides, defeating the purpose of a nice looking device, not to mention adding even more to the bulkiness. But more than anything...and I'd like the Moto people that are lurking on these reviews to respond to: Why the heck did they leave out the 1700 band? As an AT&T user, this band, from everything I've read is an important frequency for LTE. That said, I do see LTE a good part of the time, but in many places that I would ordinarily get an LTE signal on my 2014, I now get an HSPA signal. This could be a deal killer. Fortunately Amazon has a great return policy. Leaving out this band, when it was present on the previous Moto X's is mind boggling to me. Answer please?Edit: According to Lenovo/Moto reply on their forums, the claim is that the spec sheet is incorrect and the device really does have the 1700 band...hmmm.",12,3
Motorola,Unlocked does not mean unlocked anymore. Not supported with Verizon or Sprint. Must have been too hard to put that in the description.,10,1
Motorola,"Motorola has been through it all, and when they were on the down-slide, they hit a homerun with their Moto X brand. Yes, the devices didn't sell so hot...but android purists take a special liking to ""X"" phones as the software is TOP TOP TOP notch. Welcome Moto Z...it's a Moto X, and more! Also...it's more money, but it's probably worth, just not to everyone!The software is Moto, the design...Motorola influenced! With that, if you are looking for a premium device, THIS is a premium device. Sure, you might not like the fingerprint reader layout, the buttons are high (hard to reach), and the famous Moto dimple is no more...but this is still a fantastic build. The wood panels also feel fantastic and complement the device very well while holding it. The device comes with a back panel, just so you know! Oh yes...no mic jack. GET OVER IT. All manufactures have said that they will soon not support 3.5 jacks.The software is incredible. Do you have a car bluetooth? Yes? This phone will be your BEST friend while driving. Flawless voice commands that are the best on the market. Texting by voice alone has never been so easy. What Moto adds to stock android is incredible. Why can't other manufacturers do this???Moto mods. Mine are coming in the mail. I've used them. Yes, they are too expensive. The battery pack might be worth it and the speaker to some. If you buy the projector...you must have kids or have money to burn! I can't wait to see what else they come up with for mods, but the so far they are too pricey and don't meet up to most people's expectations. Keep in mind, on the JBL, you can adjust the bass up a bit more if bass is your thing. Do this through the EQ on the phone.The Battery. It's good, just not great. This will last MOST users all day, with 10% to spare at bedtime. It's not bad. I'm guessing that 7.0 will increase battery life some. Also, turn on battery saver and the battery saver for the individual apps. This does help. If you are an average user, the battery won't disappoint, but it won't be a major plus either.This is really a 4.5 device. It's a great start for mod devices and i can't wait to see what the Moto line has in store in the future. The best ideas in android are with Moto. From software to these mods, Motorola is continuing major steps in the right direction.Plus +Build Quality (9/10)Mods (great idea...too expensive)Screen (above average)Fingerprint scanner off/on function (Works wwway better than Samsung on the S7)Great Simple Camera Software (Thank You)Best android software experienceMoto Voice can ACTUALLY help youMiddleCamera (best from moto, middle of the road in the industry)Battery (should get you through the day)Whites (A little too blue)Volume Buttons (wwway up there!)Cons -Big chin!Device feels terrible without backplate (kinda sharp)Device is too big if you never use fingerprint scannerLow light photos (Could be fixed with update)The Moto logo on the front (Really???)",46,5
Motorola,"The unit has performed very well thus far. No problems with ATT compatibility - strong reception, works well teathered. With the Moto-mod camera affixed, it is an ideal solution to having both a phone and decent if not spectacular camera along for the ride (and the price for the bundle was the clincher). Battery life seems fine, the quick recharge is helpful. It seems to recharge fastest from the Motorola charger; I have used other Qualcomm 3.0 chargers - its says ""turbo charging"" when connected - but the charge time seems to be noticeably longer...",11,5
Motorola,"No regrets!! Received the product two days before the promised date! I'm completely satisfied with the phone! It's neat, sleek and perfect in design and none of the bloatware in the software side just makes it all the more better. Also, Black is definitely the right color to choose when it comes to this phone!",12,5
Motorola,Excellent android phone I ever used ‹¬too disappointed iPhone 7 switching from iOS to android ‹¬I usually don't do review but this moto z is smooth fast clean stock rom so thin and light Motorola really did good job this timeI think this is best phone in the market now ‹¬I really enjoy this phone ‹¬excellent ‹¬excellent ‹¬‹¬,12,5
Motorola,This is a nice light weight/thin phone with really fun items to add on like a camera and speaker system. I purchased everything but the projector. They even sell the large battery pack which snaps on the back to let you use the phone much longer without recharging. Since I had two note 7 phones which I had to return I was really excited about this system. They unlocked it so it works with my carrier T-Mobile. Going out to the Washington coast this weekend I found out something about the phone which is a deal breaker for me and the impetus for this phone's return... T-Mobile had no coverage where I was staying. I signed on to the property's wifi...I could not use wifi for texting or for phone calls. When I called today to Motorola they said it was a carrier issue. When I called T-Mobile they said since it was not a phone they carry they do not support wifi calling or texting. Whhaatt? There are plenty of times when the network does not have good signal...been to Hawaii lately? I always feel pretty safe knowing I can duck into a wifi hotspot and get a connection or help if I need to. Not with this phone. Too bad. The idea of new mods etc was exciting to look forward to. There were other things that did not work as smooth as Samsung phones but I was willing to overlook them because this phone feels exciting and I looked forward to new add on mods. Amazon is a champ for letting me return it within the 30 day period. I will have to figure out what to do with the accessories I purchased through Verizon.,12,3
Motorola,"Awesome phone even though it has horrible battery life but it's okay cause I got the offgrid batt mod. Also for those of you wondering if a case can be used with the mods, the answer is no! Those cases that have a hole exposing the pins are useless and misleading. The phone comes with a bumper cover for side protection and the mods protect the back",25,5
Motorola,"Dangit Lenovo. My elderly XT1053 first generation MotoX died about a year ago and I have been eagerly awaiting the MotoZ. I've been using an iPhone 6 for that year. It hasn't been the worst year of my life. That award goes to the year I caught my incestuous ex-wife with her obese cousin.What sucks about the MotoZ? Read on:* It is simply too big. After a Bowie-knife, a roll of duct-tape and a wallet stuffed with partially filled free-sandwich cards, I really don't have room in my pockets for the paper-back book this phone attempts to be.* The camera is somehow always blurry. This is great for pictures of my deep-Appalachian family, but not so useful for insurance-shots of deer, bears and other wild animals that break into my house and steal my electronics and gold-bars.* The ""wood-style-back"" is, well... very roughly 'styled' after wood. A wood that shows oily fingerprints and feels like cheap plastic. My original MotoX had real wood backing. Somehow I missed that ""wood-style"" means ""not wood anymore"". I admit, I researched weakly.If you want big, you want fake, and you want a camera that would make a Shar-Pei dog's face look unwrinkled, look no further.",24,3
Motorola,"I gave it 3 stars because it could go either way. There are two ways to look at this phone:1. One of the coolest, most feature-loaded phones for the price.2. A super-cheap deal on an advanced smartphone.If you are in category 1, this phone will be awesome. You won't find a touchscreen phone any cheaper, and this one also has some fancy organizer features, good volume, a handy set of customizable shortcut bars, and a menu system which allows you to filter which kind of menu options are displayed. The on-screen keyboard system works pretty well.However, if you are in category 2, this will be a very disappointing substitute for other phones which cost as much as the a810's original price. The menu is slow, and many sub-menus require several seconds of a ""processing"" icon before they will open. The web browser is slow, even for EDGE. It can only run one Java application at once (you will be prompted to close one if you open another). The email client has no auto-connect options at all. For such an apparently-slow processor (I couldn't find any official rating, but menu response is slow), it doesn't have very good battery life (normally the upside to slow phones). It also cannot run Opera Mini v5 (4 works), which most of my older phones handle OK.And one big problem if you want this specific phone for advanced uses... it either doesn't have any security certificates included, or at least not any common certificates (I couldn't find a way to view the list, but it fails either way). This can cause problems trying to establish secure email connections, which makes the built-in email client useless unless you want to pass on security. The phone also has problems with signed Java applications, so I can only install the unsigned version of Opera Mini (and then the phone has the nerve to ""warn"" me that it is unsigned every time I use it). This is the second secondary-market Motorola I have tried (these phones are ""new"", but were probably overstock reflashed to unbranded or US firmware) which had this issue.The bottom line is, don't get this thinking it is an amazing deal on a high-end phone, because the ultimate functionality is more like an average phone plus the touchscreen interface. But if you have a fixed budget of a hundred bucks for any kind of phone at all, this is a very cool alternative to newer phones in that price range, which will truly be entry-level.If for some reason you need a more advanced phone for a similar price, try one of the low-priced Samsung Blackjack models currently available. You will have to be OK with the rather unpleasant Windows Mobile platform, and lose the touchscreen, but it will be able to handle things the a810 fumbles with.Update:I was originally going to keep this phone as a spare or physical labor phone when I don't want to risk my ""good"" ones, since it is so cheap. But now even Opera won't run. The popup to allow internet access freezes up, and nothing works. I have to reboot to shut down the program, and even then it doesn't always work. Re-installing Opera or GMail works for a while, but that is too annoying.Update 2:""onewebmall"" is a scam website which steals reviews. I wrote this review for Amazon, not some Internet leach which steals reviews to get high search engine rankings.",17,3
Motorola,"I was pretty eager to get out of my increasingly expensive contract with Verizon. It took me awhile to make the leap because I have a strong preference for physical keyboards. Typos bug me and they're a lot harder to avoid when using a virtual keyboard (I think most people would agree). Unfortunately, Verizon seems to have the best selection of Androids with keyboards. I wanted a phone that stood a fighting chance of getting an official OS update at some point. Most of the sliders I saw on other carriers had processors that would not be able to support the newer operating systems (4.0 and up). I eventually resigned myself to the fact that I would have to get used to a virtual keyboard if I wanted to save some money. A little background: I was with Verizon for 5 years. I loved their service, but I couldn't justify spending so much money every month for service that I could probably get elsewhere for much less. I love to tinker and I'm technically-proficient, which led me to seek out avenues that a lot of people won't bother with. A little over a year before I bought the Atrix, I bought an iPhone 4s and set it up so that it could be used on an AT&T GoPhone plan. It worked out very well, with AT&T service proving to be just as reliable as what I had with Verizon (I'm near Buffalo, NY, for what it's worth). I accepted that I would not be able to find a slider that fit my specifications and looked around for an AT&T phone or something unlocked that I could use on AT&T. I eventually narrowed it down to the HTC One X or the Atrix HD. It ended up being an easy decision: I didn't want a 16GB phone that I couldn't slip a memory card into, as I'd rather have my files backed up to something I have in my possession versus having them saved to the cloud. That was the clincher for me. I appreciated the Atrix HD's relatively low price tag, considering its specs. It came with ICS, which is not yet necessarily a given with newer phones. It has a 1.5GHZ processor, which means it has the processing power for at least one more official OS update. Most of the sliders I researched had sub-1GHZ processors, which pretty much rules out the possibility of an official ICS update (the official OS requires about a 1GHZ processor to run). It has ample internal memory, but that's to be expected from most new phones that are made for post-paid use. It is a 4G phone, but I don't use the 4G (more on that later). It doesn't have NFC and, as a Motorola device, I get the feeling it will be awhile before it gets a Jellybean update, but it really isn't lacking anything that most people would expect from a newer Android phone. It does have its faults, but they're offset by its pros and price. The off-contract price for me was just over $400, including shipping and tax. My iPhone cost over $800 off-contract. I will note that I don't care for the camera, but I've yet to like any camera other than the one on my 4s. I've yet to use an 8MP camera on an Android device that doesn't disappoint. That said, the pictures are usually not hideous and using CamScanner to take tidier pictures is a workable solution for me. I'm also sort of down on the battery life, but the great-looking screen is the culprit and I know it. I rooted my phone and used RootDim to take it down a few extra notches, but the impact on battery life has not been apparent. I've owned two of these phones, as the first unit was seemingly defective. I've used and fixed many phones, but I couldn't find a permanent fix for the first unit's misbehavior. It had a tendency to bootloop every few days, something I was always able to correct by connecting my phone to ADB on my computer and running logcats to pinpoint operational errors. Doing that is far from a 10-minute process and it became obvious to me that I was finding temporary fixes for a permanent problem. The phone would usually drop its wifi connection before beginning to bootloop so I had a feeling that nothing could fix that particular device. I emailed the seller (Wireless Experts, Inc.), explained my problem and that I was probably going to return the device for another one when I was done troubleshooting. They were great about it, even offering to extend the return period for me so I could finish trying to solve the problem. Ultimately, I exchanged the phone for another Atrix HD and that one is working just as it should. I definitely have to endorse Wireless Experts, Inc. for the way they handled my problem. About 4G: I use this phone on a GoPhone plan and GoPhone does not support 4G as of right now (11/12). I have the 4G icon on my phone, but that's because AT&T sort of renamed its 3G network-haha. I don't know how well it would perform or how the battery life would be impacted by 4G. What I can say for sure is that this phone is a bargain for my monthly fee of $45. I was paying about $120 for my Droid 3 on Verizon and this phone is a much better performer, with a much better (non-Pentile) display. It was a serious upgrade for me and it's a bargain as I'm using it, considering that I had enough disposable income at the time of purchase. Great phone. Modern features (for November 2012). I'd recommend this phone and my seller to anyone who's on the market for a new phone.",23,5
Motorola,"When I purchased the phone I thought I was purchasing a ""new"" phone. When I received it, it looked like it had been opened and had been used. I could tell because the plastic on everything was torn and retaped. There wasn't any paper work with the phone. The manual that came with it had NOTHING to do with the phone, it wasn't anywhere close. I couldn't turn the phone on until I found the RIGHT manual on line.Could not get it activated because it had already been activated and the phone was useless. I'm sorry I purchased from this seller.",24,1
Motorola,"Verizon requires all ""Advanced"" phone to have a data plan. You can technically get a Prepaid data plan but that's still $75 a month with voice + data. I don't know of a way around here. Other mobile carrier does not require this.",20,3
Motorola,"I love my phone. I was sceptical at first, buying a used phone for so cheap... but it works amazing. I haven't had any problems with it and i've had it for a few months now. it's an android phone... so i can dowload all the applications that i want. Best deal i have had in a long time. :)",15,5
Motorola,"This is not a new phone. I got this to replace my previous Droid 2 but this one has clearly been reconditioned and sold as new. Very upset, because I need the phone and can't wait another 2 days to get a new one. The packaging is all wrong, the phone has scratches on the body. Very disappointed.",12,1
Motorola,"I bought this for my teenage daughter along with a 16gb sd card for $20.So for well under $100 she has a decent first smartphone.She uses it to read books on the Kindle app,she downloaded a mp3 type app and now downloads and listens to music via headphones(constantly:-))goes on facebook,take photos and videos,texts and calls of course and play a couple games she likes.So she's not a heavy user like her dad.This phone wont handle too many running widgets but it does play games good,run live wallpapers if you're into that and search the web okay.It has a 4 row qwerty (the top row has the numbers as well as the qwerty row) a removable battery (why manufacturers are making them these days without a keyboard or interchangeable batteries is beyond me) and a flash foe the camera and digital recorder.It's not a bad phone at all for the price just don't put too much strain on it,one task at a time and it works and looks good.For the price I definitely recommend it,just know that it doesn't come close to the phones coming out today as far as power.But the phones coming out today will be the same way in a couple years,they basically get 'old' in roughly 6 months so you have to watch what software you downloadIt does basically the same things as brand new phones just not as fast.Google Maps,no problem,Google searches also no problem.A decent phone especially for a first smartphone.I'm telling you,my daughter is very happy with it and that's what I wanted.I guess she can multi task with it with some things cause after she gets done with her homework more often than not she can be found with her headphones on listening to her music app while also reading from her Kindle app.I honestly don't know why there's so many negative reviews,I have a new and powerful smartphone and her Droid 2 will literally do almost everything mine does.The Droid 2 just can't run as many things at once as my phone but if they're done one at a time there's no problems.It can do basically everything and do it for a quarter the price.I haven't checked current prices but I bought my daughters Droid 2 a couple months ago via Amazon for $64.99 then got her a bigger sd card than mine also via Amazon for half what I paid for mine out of the store.So her Droid 2 can actually store a lot more info than my new phone can because she has a 16gb card and I have an 8gb.If you're new to these phones and not familiar with digital storage even 8gb is a lot.With an 8gb sd card combined with my phones internal memory I've downloaded over 250 apps not including what comes preinstalled,I've taken over 750 photos that are still stored in my phone,over an hour of video and lots of other stuff and I still have memory left.Also,if this is your first smartphone you'll probably be like most everybody else and get lots of cool apps,some of them cost money but once you buy them they're always yours even if you switch phones.Just sign up your new phone with the same email address and you can put all your paid apps on your new phone without paying again.I was so relieved when I found that out:-)I hope that helps,the Droid 2 is a really good phone for what they're asking here.I would recommend getting an extra charger for your car,they're like $3 here on Amazon,and also get a good protective cover.They make todays phone very fragile on purpose I imagine so we're forced to buy new ones in the event we drop them one too many times.My first cell phone I had back in the 90's was made like a brick,I could have literally dropped it off a roof and it would have been okay.You don't want to hop out of your car with your phone in your lap with today's phones,that's how I broke my last one:-)Droid 2 is a great starter smartphone in my opinion.",24,5
Motorola,I have only had this phone about a month but so far it has been a great phone.. It takes awesome pictures and i love how easy it is to put them on facebook. This is my first smart phone so it will take me a while to get use to all the options. Phone calls sound great. It does not have a missed call beep so i need to get an app for that i guess. Overall this phone is way worth the money. The slide out keyboard is not as great as my last regular phone because the numbers at the top are really close to the edge of the slider part of the phone and you also have to use shift to use them but other than that I have no complaints.,13,4
Motorola,"This is my mother's first android ... and she is in love. And .... She`s hard to please and not a cheerful learner. Shes enjoying every minute of learning her new interactive Android. The phone is touch screen with easy to follow apps and icons. If its ones first phone playing around with it a day or two will help! By the third day...it'll be glued to ones hand, like my mother`s glued to her hands",20,5
Motorola,"It was this or the IPhone4S. I preferred the bigger screen and qwerty keyboard. Initially I had a problem with receiving calls, but I contacted the seller, (5 Star) and was advised to dial #228 to update phone to the newest Verizon towers. Voila! Now I receive all my calls. I found that I seldom use the qwerty board since there are so many easier keyboard apps available for android. It's solid and sturdy, call quality is good and I don't have a problem with battery life. I wanted this Froyo system phone so I could one touch root it with Z4Root. I froze all the apps that turn on by themselves with Titanium Pro; that saves a lot of battery life. Since I don't use the qwerty I was admiring the Moto Droid X with no physical keyboard and a bigger screen. I really like this phone and have found it to be very dependable and easy to use.",17,5
Motorola,"Given the abuse given to the devises by teens, I have adopted these phones for my family. The metal frames are more rugged than those of plastic. The screen size is large enough for image viewing, yet the overall dimensions allow pocket fitting. The keyboard is a bit small for my fingertips but fit the females well. Wifi works well. Speech is clear. Camera has flash. When applied to a non "" V "" carrier that subleases ""V"" bandwidth, I get unlimited voice/message and 2 G data for $50/month, no contract. Phone destruction gives rise to a lecture but I am not out of an arm and leg. A new purchase, a memory card transfer, a phone number transfer to the new phone and back in business in one hour or less.. ....... .",16,4
Motorola,Received this phone very quickly! Works better than a droid bought at a Verizon store. Would definitely recomend this product.,10,5
Motorola,"I was hesistant to order a non-contract phone from Amazon. I deliberated ordering from Amazon or just paying more from Verizon so I knew it would work. I was nervous but I ordered the phone from Amazon. It arrived in less than a week. We opened it up and found the phone in new condition as we had hoped. It took longer to get Verizon to switch it onto our plan but that was a Verizon issue not phone issue. We will definitely consider ordering an Amazon phone from this retailer in future. In using phone, it works great and we've had no problems with it.",13,5
Motorola,"The phone was in good condition, and had a clean esn. However it freezes on a black screen about 20 times a day. The only way to un freeze it is to remove the battery wait 30 seconds and turn it back on. Verizon helpped me trouble shoot the phone and it still happens. I am a little disappointed, it is a pain to have to do this all day long. We have two other phones like this and it does not happen to them so its just this phone.",17,2
Motorola,The Droid 3 by Motorola was an excellent buy. It came ready to be put into use and has not shown any glitches since it's been received. I recommend this product and I have recently purchased one for my nephew as well.,12,5
Motorola,"Update: Motorola is willing to honor warranty and repair phone at no charge based on proof of purchase date.First, the phone did not come with the car charger as advertised. Since it was a replacement phone, I didn't worry about it. The booklet and warrenty information that is in the box with all new phones was missing. Also not a big deal as I was relacing the same type of phone. Now, after 89 days, the phone screen has turned to a gazillion speckles. All attempts to 'reset' the phone have failed.So, if you have $250 to spend on a phone every 90 days, this is the phone for you.Amazon stated their 30 return policy and told me to contact the manufacturer for warrenty. It would be great if I had the warrenty information which was missing fron the box. I am left without a phone, unable to purchase another, no warrenty information, and relying on the charity of Motorola to hopefully make this right...if indeed it is really a NEW phone.",12,1
Motorola,"I like the Droid 3 better.Am on Page Plus so can't use 4g anywayTradeoff's were: more ram and dual core processing power on 4 (but not too much more to make a difference in what can be done on the phone)vs.less storage space on 4 (8g) as opposed to 16 gig internal storage on 3(some torrent apps, (Mu Torrent, for example), default to internal storage, even if they are set to download directly to the sd card,once downloaded, it can easily be transferred afterward to sd card, and deleted from internal storage space, but the space needs to be there on the phone internal, for the download.)Both work with the new 64gig sandisk micro sd card, as long as the card is first formatted to FAT(It ships formatted as NTFS)Both have great hard sildeout keyboards, and (afik) motorola is NOT planning a Droid 5 or anything else with a slideout hard keyboard ;-((I definitely prefer my Droid 3 over my wife's iPhone 5 ;-)",18,4
Motorola,I PURCHASED THE DROID 3 AS AN UPGRADE FROM THE LG ALLY. I LOVE THE PHONE. I NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK WITH THE PAGEPLUS SERVICE AND WAS HAPPY TO FIND ONE ON AMAZON. PHONE WORKS WELL.,15,5
Motorola,"I am using Verizon prepaid ($50/month) and this phone works great with that. Love the full qwerty keyboard, and app capabilities!",15,5
Motorola,"I was sick of mis-typing on touch keyboards and longed for a physical keyboard like on my old Sony Xperia. Unfortunately, no such Android phones exist here in Australia, so took a risk in buying this one. I was not disappointed. Plenty of technical support available online and no issues putting a Telstra NextG SIM card into this phone.Advertised as re-furbished, but it came without a scratch. Looked good as new to me! Also managed to pick up a Lapdock 100 on eBay so now I can use this as a very light laptop with excellent battery life.Highly recommended!",15,5
Motorola,"I'm one of those people that prefers a smaller phone that can be operated with one hand. I had a Droid Maxx and then a Nexus 6 and bought this as my daily phone. It arrived in like new condition with a charger and cable. I inserted the SIM card and off I went. No problems or issues at all. This phone, while an older model, still runs all current apps. While I don't play games on it much it can do that well. I have over 130 apps installed and music on it. Storage is minimal but expected so you should plan accordingly. Great phone, love the way it feels in my hand. In & out of the pocket fast and can swype type with no issues one handed. Love this phone. Wish that there were more models out there of a similar size.",10,5
Motorola,"My current phone failed due to a problem with recharging. My service provider (Verizon) could not provide a replacement, even a refurb. This purchase saved me from having to buy a newer model phone at a higher price. As noted in other reviews, all I had to do was remove the SIM card from the old phone and install it in the new one. Everything about the setup has gone smoothly. I'd have no hesitation about going this route again in similar circumstances. Amazon's fast shipping minimized the inconvenience.",10,5
Motorola,"I got this phone because in the description it said it was ""like new"" but when I got the phone, there was an approx. inch scratch on the screen of the phone. The reason I gave a 2 and not 1 star was that they were willing to take back the phone and exchange it, but that is after I ship it to them, they take 24 to 48 hours to inspect the phone, and then wait for the replacement phone to get her. Not likely. I am unsatisfied and the next time they want to sell a phone with a scratch on it, I hope they explain the defect in the description. I hope that this helps.",10,2
Motorola,"So far a great phone! I am going to Europe this summer so I needed a GSM capable phone. Sold my Iphone 4s and purchased this Droid. My only complaint is this odd virtually unnoticeable sound when listening to music and talking on the phone. I purchased it used, didn't expect it to be perfect. definitely surpassed my expectations.",13,4
Motorola,"I will admit I was REALLY nervous about buying this phone knowing it was used. I've had it now for almost a month and I couldn't be happier. With that being said I will say there was a few cons. When I first tried to turn it on, nothing happened. I was starting to panic, so I Googled what the issue may be and all it took was a reboot of the phone. Since then I have not had to reboot, and it has functioned just fine. The only other downside to the phone was the charger. It did not work, and it was actually meant for a Samsung Galaxy phone. I tried it on two other phones, and it will not charge anything. I ended up using the charger for my old Android. All in all I LOVE my new phone! Thank you Amazon for not screwing me over! (Oh, and FYI sellers, remember to clear your phones before selling them. I discovered photos of a man who I assume is the seller and his children. Thankfully there were no nude or disturbing photos!! :P )",49,5
Motorola,"I was a cellular phone technician for 4 years, and this is my favorite phone. I love the extremely long battery life. The response is always snappy, and the functions this has are superior to my Samsung Fascinate (Galaxy SCHI500). I have a low profile gas tank mount for this phone to use on my motorcycle. The battery is RARELY below 60%, and that's if I leave it off the charger for more than 24 hours. To maximize the battery life, I use the ""smart actions"".. while I'm at work, my phone doesn't use Bluetooth, WiFi, ring or vibrate (I could actually put it in ""airplane mode"", but I want to see the missed calls). The phone has never needed a case, or screen protector, it does however need to be wiped constantly, or my screen ""unlock pattern"" is easily visible from previous uses. The volume is very good, the Bluetooth pairs easily, and the phone itself is awesome. Once in a while I've had it randomly power down, then back up. I've never had a smart phone that DOESN'T do that, so I guess I'm used to it. At least it's never done it while I'm in a phone call. The only odd part, is that I can't remove the battery to ""reset"" the phone. I did root my phone, but I still have the stock ROM on it. I just use ""driodwall"" to keep pesky programs from ""phoning home"" and sending information over 3G or 4G when I don't know about it. That also eliminates almost all the ads on stuff.",38,5
Motorola,"If I could give this phone and the seller zero stars, I would. I almost never write reviews unless I am really impressed by a productƒ??but this is beyond horrible. Immediately out of the box, the processor lagged, skipped, and sometimes completely failed. Apps will close multiple times during use and others will randomly open. This phone has already self-called numerous people. I have had the phone for 48 hours and am ready to back over it with my Jeep. As of 15 minutes ago, the keyboard went completely haywire and will type nothing but gibberish.When your husband has been deployed for 10 months and your only communication with him is via Facebook messenger, and you can't be near a laptop at all times, having a keyboard that doesn't function is completely unacceptable. Wellƒ??it's unacceptable in any situation, but this has left me highly regretting my decision to purchase a phone from anybody other than the retailer (husband dropped and cracked his overseas - I purchased this phone so I could send him my other one). Lesson learned. Save your money and your time. This phone is listed as ""new"". It arrived with blemishes on the back, and the way it operates there is no way that this is a new phone. I have already printed out my return label.",18,1
Motorola,"Everyone loves this phone.Must say the battery life is not days. I can get from Flagstaff at 7 am to 11 at night without a charge driving across the Rez(lots of NO service) to Moab; with games and surfing and maps whenever I do have service. My old Droid4 couldn't' do 2 hours of that. Slightly bigger than old Droid, but not TOO big, fast, takes 32GB additional card so have 64GB total, I like that.Got this for the battery life, and I like what it can do. Can easily do a day and a half in service areas.",11,5
Motorola,"No joke. I paid almost $300 for this phone back in March - phone arrived in sealed package, with everything seeming legit until I went to activate it with Verizon I was told the phone is useless to me as it was flagged as being stolen. beware 3rd party sellers and shame on verizon for forcing me to get a phone elsewhere just to keep my unlimited data.",46,1
Motorola,"It took a bit of time to receive this phone but it was worth the wait. I was using a regular Droid before I got this, which made the transition easy for me. I love all the apps I can use and the 4g is sooo much faster. The battery life is great! If I am not using my phone very much, a charge will last 3 or 4 days. It is fast and efficient. I am getting used to the phone's keyboard as my other phone had a pull out keyboard but that comes with time and use.",14,5
Motorola,"Best DROID I've had to date. Battery has to be charged every couple of days with medium use....way better then my S2. Nice camera and video. Big screen, but not too big. Makes it easy to read screen. Easy to navigate I would reccommend the Razr MAXX for anyone",18,5
Motorola,"I'm giving it a four out of five because I order the ballistic nylon version and got the metallic black version,and it didn't come with the turbo charger.

Motorola,"I bought for my wife the Motorola Flipside MB508 cell phone to replace her other cell phone that she had from Trax. With her new phone she is able to do so much more! Best of all it is compatible for our business use! This phone has so many features, and built in apps that her old cell phone looked like a toy! She got it as an early birthday gift and has been enjoying every minute of it! It works great with the internet and is super fast and makes me envious that my older cell phone is not as COOL as hers! It was a great price and it really was so easy to use to take credit cards from our customers! WE LOVE THIS PHONE!!",10,5
Motorola,"It is cheap for a smart phone, but you do not even get what you pay for.1. Keyboard is not very responsive and I have to do a lot of backspacing to make corrections.2. Reception is poor. Others using the same network with different phones have a signal when I have nothing.3. Camera takes mediocre pictures and half the videos I shoot are unplayable.4. Battery life is just ridiculous. I use my phone very little and find myself having to charge it after a day and half of idle time. I don't have wireless or gps enabled.5. Back cover comes off too easily.1. Call quality is decent and have not experienced a dropped call.If I were the type of person who was remotely serious about my phone, I would have returned it and spent a little more for a better phone.UPDATE: I wanted to reinforce my opinion on how terrible this phone is. If you take a video that is more than a few (30 seconds?) the file will be corrupt and unplayable and you have to perform a hard reboot to get the camera to work again. HATE THIS PHONE SO MUCH!UPDATE 2: After reinstalling factory settings the standby battery life has GREATLY improved. I did shoot 2 videos in excess of 2 minutes without a problem. Before you yell at me for breaking my phone know that I have not installed a single application and made no alterations whatsoever. It seems this phone came with some glitches in its OS as all these problems occurred right out of the box. I have upgraded my review to 3 stars. IF YOU GET THIS PHONE, THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS RESET TO FACTORY DEFAULT BEFORE POPULATING IT WITH APPS AND CONTACTS.",13,3
Motorola,"I bought this phone to use for straight talk, and it works great! only thing I don't like is the battery life and the phone didnt come with a micro SD card and memory is horrible. but besides that, it has been working great! I had to partition the 16 gb SD card I bought, so I could link apps to it, and it helped alot. Taskiller also saves the battery. I use to have to carry my charger to work for only 8 hours and would have to charge it 3 times. but now it lasts a full day even when calling people and messing around with apps! Android came as 2.2 instead of 2.1 so that was a plus. Overall, this phone is really easy to understand and has been great!! I would totally recommend!",19,5
Motorola,"First and foremost this is a Style and Media phone. Silver is far more luxe than tired black and it synchs w/ this shiny glass front much better. T-Mobile's silver KRZR k1 is glam. The sound of the media player is peerless (to my knowledge). The sizable micro mini memory card holds plenty of media, and this is a good thing for a phone which records up to 3+ minute movies at a time. What's more, you may even arrange playlists to suit your mood & the battery life seems much better than one might expect w/ such a bright screen to boot. However, I might dim it a few notches for optimal battery life. It will still be plenty bright.The camera is quite noteworthy. More adjustments than I can get into, just know that you need to adjust both camera and video to take best quality photos. They are not the default settings. You might also note that, any time you zoom a pic or vid, you are greatly reducing its clarity. Other than that, adjust your images to 2 megapixels and your photos will be quite large and quite clear. I'm one of those w/whom the difference between HDTV and a good TV is almost unrecognizable. I like a nice, crisp photos... I don't study them. GREAT camera... great video.Music, videos and photos may be downloaded via bluetooth or a USB cable which is provided.Now on to the Net. This is where the rubber meets the road for me as I don't really use portable music players. Right off the bat, I downloaded Opera's Mini Browser. It's far more robust than the factory installed. I was able to go to Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo mail and many other sites as well. The KRZR also comes loaded w/ Y! Messenger & AIM. Good stuff. This phone does NOT have an email client.I'm a smartphone owner (Nokia 6600), so I'm used to an email client for a couple of accounts and being able to use Opera Mobile which allows one to attach files and send messages, open multiple windows, store passwords and bookmarks, download mp3s as well as access nearly any website. Unfortunately, sick American corporations have determined that since we will pay an extra $20-30/month for PDA service (basically the same phone w/ a QWERTY keyboard), why offer more affordable smarthphones. THANKS TO AMAZON you may still purchase smartphones, but usually w/o the discount attached to a service plan.As for reception, this has as much to do w/ locale as phone and service operator. T-Mobile is a GSM carrier which means you may use your phone all over the globe. It also means you may text overseas & you have a SIM card to transport your phone book and account easily to any other GSM phone you may have or purchase. If you purchase an unlocked GSM phone in Timbuktu, you may insert your card and go. Not so w/ Sprint & Verizon. Ya gotta go through daddy. At one time TDMA/CDMA services (Sprint & Verizon) had better tracking, but GSM (T-Mobile & AT&T) has caught up. T-Mobile has excellent reception and tracking... at least in the places I've been to & my phone worked in Europe w/ ease.I always thought of Motorolas as cheap and the RAZR as gimmicky. Moto's interface is a bit dated and could be a tad more intuitive, but the KRZR seems to be of good quality so far.As for Wirefly, well, I'm no fan of the company. One worker had the nerve to ask for my credit card info. Nice try, but I don't use my credit card twice for the same purchase. What the fffff.....!Overall, The KRZR K1 is decidedly an upscale unit. It has USB, bluetooth, stereo bluetooth, 2 megapixel camera, Opera Mini, memory card, records 3+minute videos, will hold numerous songs, works overseas, has excellent sound, a bright screen and sexy looks to boot. HOT and HAUGHT! It's a wonderful phone - more for the Dolce & Gabbana type than the 'down and dirty' type.",10,4
Motorola,"Just ordered this phone and am returning it because there are foreign characters (I think Chinese) above each number on the keypad. Its distracting when you are dialing or texting. If you look really closely at the larger picture of the keypad (on this product page) you can just make them out. At any rate, I thought I'd let people know. I ordered another one from TigerDirect and hopefully won't have the same problem with that one.Update - the TigerDirect one had the same problem with the keypad. Am returning that and ordering from the Motorola website. Hope that one is fine.",10,3
Motorola,"I just upgraded from a RAZR phone, and this new KRAZR is exceptionally nice. The phone has great reception, the sound quality & volumn are very good, the menus are very easy to get around,it fits your face well (not too short as many phones now are) and operating the phone is simple. This phone is clearly evident of Motorola's evolution in the cell-phone industry. By the way, you can customize the ""soft-keys"" to be whatever you want them to be. Likewise, you can customize the menus to appear as you would like. They have really thought of the user and have made this phone very User Friendly as well. It seems that the majority of the people I talk to aren't as interested in ""whistles & bells"" as much as they just want a plain old GOOD phone. This is it! However, if you want more, you can load your MP3 music on to it, you can use the calendar, you can take a picture, and if you are really adventurous, you can access the internet, and also retreive your email! By the way, this phone is capable of taking advantage of the Cingular/AT&T EDGE network which gives you 'faster than usual' internet. I highly recommend this Good Looking, Well Working phone.",54,5
Motorola,"This is a great phone. What impressed me most about it was several things. One was its sleek design and feel. If you liked the RAZR, this phone will really knock your socks off. It's not quite as wide as the RAZR, which makes it easier on the hands, and it's solid construction makes you feel like you're holding a quality product. I love how it snaps shut after you finish a call. It's satisfying. Two, it has better reception than the RAZR, or at least it seems that way to me. I don't have any data to support this claim, but I have fewer dropped calls on this phone, and the volume is much better. I don't find myself pressing the phone against my ear like I used to do with the RAZR, which is really nice. Three, I dig the MP3 and multimedia features. I popped a 2GB card in the phone and loaded about 50 of my favorite songs and about 75 family photos in it. It's great because now I can set the phone alarm to wake up to my favorite songs, or set ring tones to whatever tune I have loaded on it. Also, I setup a playlist and listed to it while jogging the other day. I was most impressed. I also created a family album on the phone and showed it to friends in a slideshow format. It was funny. Rather than complimenting me on my beautiful family, they focused their comments on the photo quality of my phone. I was like, dude. Anyway, if you like cool phones, I totally recommend this one. Yeah it's pricey, but from my perspective, it's worth it. One last comment. I'm a Cingular customer and they, if you haven't noticed, haven't offered the KRZR K1 phone to their customers yet. Well, that's okay. You can still use this phone on thier network. All you have to do is take the phone out of the box, pop in your old SIM card from your previous phone, then call Cingular and ask them to activate it. They will ask you for the IMEI number located on the box and within minutes, you will be connected. It was a snap. Enjoy!",29,5
Motorola,"I ordered this from Amazon via Hassle-Free Cell on Monday and had the phone Friday using standard shipping. It was new and even had a fresh battery (manufacture date 8/2008); although manufactured for SE Asia the default language was English and everything works great. I liked my old Razr V3 but it was a little bulky; I loved my moto Pebl but it bit the dust after a nasty fall. The K1 combines the best of both those phones, plus adds a music player. It has a nice solid feel with a rubberized back and a very crisp, high-contrast display like the Pebl and unlike the Razr. One of the things I like about Motorola phones is that accessories using mini-USB work for all their phones, as far as I know. This includes Phone Tools software, stereo earbuds, chargers, etc. so I didn't have to buy all that stuff over again. Call volume and quality is very good and the music player sounds great, although it is a bit quirky and limited and doesn't have external music player control buttons like the CDMA version. The player doesn't recognize a lot of the MP3s I loaded on a 2 gig card, but maybe I just need to wipe it and try again. Like the other Motos I mentioned, the soft keys can be programmed so that there is ready to access to the things I frequently use, like the calendar and alarms. In picking a phone I didn't really care about the voice recognition feature, but it works so well that I use it all the time now. I don't have or need a data plan, so I can't speak to the browser feature, which is no doubt very primitive compared to a smart phone. Overall this an excellent phone for calling, and at a very reasonable price.",10,5
Motorola,"Buyer beware, this is a EUROPEAN model (the Milestone also comes in a Canadian version) so 3G is 900/2100 only and that means there is NO WAY to get 3G in the USA, either with T-Mobile or with AT&T - Amazon USA should not be selling this phone without a BIG DISCLAIMER - not to mention they should specify it is a UK model (comes with the original UK charger and a US adapter).I need an Android phone so if I find there is a GSM Android phone out there that works on a 3G network in the USA I'm returning it.I've wasted about 10 hours since I got it yesterday :1. Trying to connect to my AdHoc wifi network : forget about that Google have killed that basic feature in Android that 99.99% of the WiFi enabled devices (WinMo, iPhone, Blackberry, Internet Radio, etc...) have.2. Finding out that this 3G phone sold by Amazon USA does not work with any 3G network in the USA.",80,1
Motorola,"This thing cost way too much, but it is a great phone. Every thing works, the keyboard is nice (except the keys are a little too flat), the screen, the camera, everything works well.I Have had two problems though - First I bought this phone to use with T-mobile, but it doesn't operate at the frequency T-mobile uses for their 3G service. Second, after the last upgrade it has randomly started playing music. It is a known bug with some work-arounds, but it is very annoying.So, with all the new variants coming out, I'd say look for something newer on contract first. But if there is a price drop (as stock and demand drop) this is a very capable choice.",31,4
Motorola,"If you are looking for a non-apple smartphone, this is it.Primary function, being a phone, is outstanding. The phone has a good reception and you are able to have clear conversations even in noisy environments like games or construction sites.Additionally, it is full of features with out of the box google integration. The screen is amazing and very responsive. Gps, camera and wi-fi works as expected. The full qwerty slider keyboard works great, however keys are too flat. Form factor is adequate. The phone is slim and not so heavy.Despite of the bugs mentioned in several forums, I haven't found any. The piece I got came already with the Android 2.1 update and works straightforward.It deserve a ""well done"" for the engineers at Motorola.",29,5
Motorola,"Since people like lists, I'll start with what I liked and disliked.Pros:1. One of the best screens that is not an iPhone 4.2. Amazing browsing capabilities.3. Relatively fast processor and GPU.Cons:1. Constant echo on all voice calls (T-Mobile and Skype).2. Sound quality through the earpiece is mediocre.3. People on the other end often complain of audio distortion (e.g. thought they had the wrong number on numerous occasions because they couldn't recognize my voice).4. Music player starts playing on its own through speakerphone several times per day, even if you haven't used it since a restart. Only way to avoid it is to shut off phone entirely.5. Keyboard is garbage for everything but playing games.6. Sliding mechanism on screen is loose which means it will open partially in your pocket, turning on the screen momentarily (but continually) and killing your battery life.7. Build quality is very cheap; unit feels very fragile overall and housing was actually loose around the buttons, especially camera and volume rocker buttons.8. Outbound calls that aren't dialed through Contacts list make the phone crash completely about 5% of the time (I counted about 1 in 20 calls did this).9. Browser performance gradually slows over a couple days until you reset the phone.10. Camera is absolute garbage.11. Accelerometer is way too slow for a phone of this price and supposed quality.I tried really hard to love this phone, as I had used one on several occasions in the past and was quite impressed. Going in I realized that the keyboard is not exactly the best for what it's primarily designed for (i.e. typing messages), but it is amazing for retro gaming. Even though it's reversed from the usual gamepad setup, the keyboard is very good for use with S/NES and other game system emulators. For writing messages, it's simply too awkward, and in spite of my best efforts I could not get accustomed to it to the point that it was usable. The onscreen keyboard is much better.The default browser is pretty good, and the screen is just amazing in terms of color, brightness and sharpness. As a capacitive touchscreen, it is easily as responsive as you'd expect, though I did often experience sluggishness with on-screen command taps, even with no demanding services or applications running. Physically speaking, I wasn't that impressed with the sliding mechanism under the screen, however. I don't know if it was particular to the unit I received, but the screen was quite loose. For some reason there was even some give up and down, not just side to side. That is, the screen moved in four directions, not just two, which made me quite nervous, as the screen overall seemed to have a tenuous connection to the body of the phone. Additionally, the screen moved way too easily in the directions it's supposed to and did not lock into an open or closed position. As I mentioned above, it started to slide at the slightest provocation while in my pocket. The problem is that every time the screen is moved like that, the phone wakes up and remains on for the duration you specify in settings. Turning auto-off to a lower setting might help, but honestly that's a pretty lame workaround. The phone shouldn't be so loosely constructed as to allow opening without a respectable amount of force in the first place.Unfortunately the worst aspect of this phone was its primary function, namely as a phone. Every time I used it I heard an echo of myself through the earpiece. Using a bluetooth or wired headset eliminated most of it, but for me that's a very impractical solution. And given the cost of the phone, I am not about to suffer with a workaround for something that is supposed to work so well already. After noticing the problem, I did some searching and came across quite a few other users who have experienced similar issues. It seems to be a possible manufacturing defect, but after reading stories of users who had to exchange their units upwards of half a dozen times before getting one that functioned passably well as a phone, I decided to return mine and not exchange it.Besides the audio problems, I noticed something unusual when dialing numbers manually. After dialing a number with the keypad and hitting send, the phone would sometimes lock up. After about 10 seconds, the Motorola and then Android logos would appear, meaning the phone had just reset itself. This happened to me twice before I started to get concerned. I managed to reproduce the problem myself, though it takes between 10 and 20 manually dialed calls before the phone crashes completely. Still, that is a number that I am simply not willing to live with. What if that one call out of however many happened to be extremely important? What if I were dialing 911 or 112 when it crashed like that? It's a risk that I am not willing to take.Returning to the audio quality for a moment, I should also mention the unusual distortion that callers would hear on their end of the phone. Often it would happen towards the beginning of calls, where for the first 5 seconds or so it would sound as if my voice were being heavily modulated up or down, akin to what is done to protect someone's identity on TV interviews. Eventually it goes away, but again it was something that happened far too often to be an acceptable quirk.At the end my biggest annoyance was the music player. If you have any music at all on your SD card or in your phone's memory, be prepared for the music player to start up of its own accord and play a random song through your speakerphone. This happened to me daily, even after I installed a new default audio player, which was the suggested workaround I found on some unofficial forum. It would often turn itself on during the most inopportune times: In a meeting at work, in a quiet elevator, at a movie theater, at 3am when we're asleep, and so on. The only way that I could manage to get it to stop happening was to remove all music from the phone, but since I use my phone at the gym as an mp3 player, it was an impractical solution.Using many workarounds, this phone would maybe have been usable, but for the price and for what it is supposed to offer, it was simply unacceptable for me. It's distinctly possible that I'm just unlucky and got a defective unit, but keep in mind that every problem I mention above has been well documented elsewhere by numerous others for almost a year now.",12,2
Motorola,i have been using milestone for almost 2 months in usa with t-mobile.i just get EDGE internet speed but it enough for me.i used to have nokia n900 but i returned it bacause of no portrait mode and hard to use like a cell phone.This phone is perfect slim and light.you can use all google features with this phone.phone calls easy and has a detail call log.after the new firmware update its better.gps reception is perfect.battery is enough for all day.it has nice accessories.and I really appreciate shopping with AMAZON never let me down i strongly reccommend this phone and AMAZON.,21,5
Motorola,"This wonderful unlocked Moto E Phone I am delighted with as for the low price that I paid, it has far surpassed my expectations in a smartphone! Since I own a HUGE five inch Samsung Galaxy Grand, this phone I find just perfect for travel and it is so easy to hold due to the curved back. For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone.PROS:+ Battery Life - Simply AMAZING - the absolute best battery life of any smartphone or tablet that I have owned! Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps, this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer! In fact, I have gotten a day and a half of battery use (I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc). However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least a full day with about 20 percent left (sometimes more) and then I charge it overnight. *The very long battery life is what sold me on this phone. Too many times in the past with phones that have too many bells and whistles, the battery ran out so quickly. However, this phone lasts me all day until I go to bed when it goes back on it's charger!+ Built in slip proof anti slip (bumper) cover - In a sense, the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back, that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone. However, I have my eye on a book style cover for this phone already!The back of this phone removes you you can change the color of the back part to a different color etc.+ Screen Resolution - AMAZING! The colors are vivid and the fonts, icons are very clear. Even though this is a smaller phone at 4.3 inch screen, when I view pages on the internet, the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful!And the screen is so clear that I can read PDF books using Adobe Reader and see the pages without my glasses!+ KitKat / Pure Android Experience - Since this has the pure Android with no overlays over it, and just the essential apps installed, this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android! This means that KitKat OS runs better and faster also I have found. I know as I own two Samsung tablets with KitKat that I love, but they have bloatware on them, this phone does not). It received the Kit Kat update to 4.4.3 soon after I purchased this phone so it is very up to date and running very smoothly.+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - The strongest WiFi yet of any phone that I have owned, and I really am serious! This phone has Very, very fast connect and it keeps the connect. In fact in the back of my home (the furthest from my router), I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone! This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected at the same time to the router, and there is no loss in speed.+ External SD Card Information - Since this phone has an external SD slot, I installed my 32GB SanDisk Micro Class 4 Micro SD card and it installed and has worked just fine on this Moto phone. Note that some people who own 32GB or higher SD cards with Class 10 have had their phones sometimes give them error message: SD Card unexpectedly removed. This is NOT the fault of the phone. As I have researched this extensively, my findings have stated that it because a smartphone or tablet reads a class 4 or Class 6 card better. However, just some people have this problem with a class 10 card, but for me, I stick with the class 4 SD card and have never encountered this problem on this phone or on any phone or tablet that I have used.+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me.+ Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK, but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go (which lets me edit, save, view in MS Office types and also view PDF files). There is also a MS Office App (free) in the Playstore.+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK. It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK (and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud). However, let me suggest Rocket Music Player (free) from the Playstore. I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc. I have already created my playlists on it and the sound from this player is superb!+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ Peppy and fast - Found the response on this phone to be very peppy and fast, no lagging ever!CONS:- The new Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash (which I installed) gets some online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos (I use Maxthon Browser and have had good results, however, I could not get Amazon videos to play).- No flash on the 5MP Camera. This is a lower end camera, I suggest that you use your regular camera for the best picture taking situations. However, to test this camera, I took several outdoor shots as well as a few indoor shots (in bright lighting) and to my amazement, the pictures looked OK, and good enough to email and keep, yet I will be taking my regular digital camera for more serious camera shots.-- Somewhat Low internal storage (but not a problem). The good news is that if an App has KitKat standard and it is newer updated app, then it can be move onto the External SD Card. I was able to move more than half of my installed apps so I still have 1.5GB left on my internal space!- No NFC and NO OTG - This phone will not work with an OTG Adapter with flash drive and other USB devices. This is not a problem as I use Dropbox for sending pictures, etc. No NFC (Near Field Communication) - I do not use this so this is not a problem for me.Bottom line: Would I buy this Moto E phone over again? Yes, I certainly would buy this phone again because it is easy to use, SUPERB battery life, as well as simple to operate. If you are looking for a easy to use and low cost Android smartphone that has really great battery life, let me suggest this phone to you. Also, since I am a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section.",287,5
Motorola,"Overall, a fantastic phone for the money. A great entry level smartphone or backup phone for trips to the beach, camping, etc. where you'd not want to risk a more expensive device. The smaller size, rugged plastic housing, and Gorilla Glass screen make it ideal for someone that is looking for a functional smartphone that can take some rough handling.While the phone has 4GB of storage, only 2.2GB are user-accessible for loading applications and data (the remaining 1.8GB is occupied by the operating system and it's reserved storage.) The beauty of this phone is that it offers an microSD card slot, so by purchasing and installing a 32GB card (under $20) you can expand the storage to more than what more expensive phones offer.The sdcard can be used to store photos, music, and many larger applications can be moved to the sdcard to free up the internal storage.Cons:No NFC support.No front facing camera.No flash on rear camera.Rear camera lens is fixed-focus.Pros:Excellent performance, even with Battery Saver enabled.Screen is bright and crisp; auto-brightness functions well.Large, bright white notification LED.Exceptional all day (almost 2 days) battery life. Edit: First full charge cycle 100% to 15% lasted 1 day 16 hours, including 5 hours of screen on time.SD card slot for expanding storage capacity.Decent speaker volume and sound quality.Bootloader is easily unlocked :)",91,5
Motorola,"UPDATED ON: 10/31/2014 - Finally figured out why I couldn't move my apps to the SDCard. Details bellow. I will improve my rating by 1 (to 4 stars). I don't mind the low-res camera, but that lack of AUTO-FOCUS is what separates this phone from being the perfect PRODUCT <-> PRICE combination.Hi,This is my first serious product review, so going to try to be short (except on the storage size part - needed further detailing) and to the point:PROS:- Price: It doesn't get any cheaper for an Android 4.4 smartphone that keeps its software up-to-date and is responsive enough- Form Factor: I like it. Feels safe in your hands. I don't like to use covers, so I appreciate the fact that it has a good grip on it and feels easy and comfortable to handle.- Screen Color: Is not AMOLED or any of that but it is still a great screen with decent resolution. Vivid colors and good enough for watching videos.- Battery Life: A wonder. I have gone almost 2 days (from 6AM one day, to 11pm of the next day) with out charging it. This, I love, I don't have to worry too much about it. Just charge it like 2 hours every couple days and that is it. And that last 10% charge seems to last for hours.CONS:- Rebooting once in a while: I think it is because mine is constantly in its memory limit, but sometimes it reboots. Not an issue for me. Thought you shoud know. Again LIMITED CAPACITY PHONE.- ""Slowish"" at times: Some times, it takes a little to respond. But is not much of an issue, once it responds, it moves fluidly.- Camera: Awful. That is just it. It does OK on the basic pictures, you know, like to detail your message or show something, but don`t even think about taking a landscape/selfie witht this one. Is just a warrior cam - for those quick pics on the go, not for the state-of-the-art, price winning photo. The worst thing is not the picture quality but the LACK OF AUTO-FOCUS. I do hate that part.- No flash: The camera is just awful, so it just doesn't matter that it doesn't have flash, even if it did, the pics would still be awful at night. hehehe.- Storage Size: Those 2GIGS really fall short after a few months with it. How do I put this?. You need to carefully handle this phone's capacity. And you DEFINITELY NEED AN SD CARD WITH THIS PHONE!. Just buy the combo from the start: PHONE + (SD CARD > 8GB).CAREFULLY HANDLING ITS CAPACITY: What does this mean? Due to Android 4.2+ limits, YOU CAN'T MOVE APPS WHEN ITS OCCUPIED STORAGE IS > 50MBs, which, after a month of use applies to every widely used app. This is a hardset restriction, I couldn't find a way to bypass it. But there is a solution which requires GETTING USED TO: RIGHT AFTER INSTALLING ANY APP, INMEDIATELY MOVE IT TO THE SD CARD. Most apps at the beggining are under 50MBs and movable. The only apps I wasn't able to move were: WHATSAPP and FACEBOOK. I think that is just another hardset configuration. But no issue. Since I re-installed AND INMEDIATLY MOVED most of my apps, I have between 700MB and 800MBs of free internal memory constantly, so the storage limit has stopped being an issue.DEPENDING ON YOUR TASTE:-Screen Size: I like smallscreen phones, but some people probably don't. I wouldn't mind it being bigger for video watching, but I watch most of my vids on the laptop, so. Not an issue for me. If you watch lots inSUMARRYYou won't find any better ""cheap"" smartphone. Great for socializing: messenger, calls, social networks. Awful for taking pics.This is a warrior smartphone. Reminds me of the old NOKIAS. I love its longlasting battery and the fact that even though I was uncomfortable at first with the storage size and the awful camera, I really din't care since I only spend $130 on it.It is not a bargain, it is not a steal, nor a theft, It is just an excelent/incredible price for this warrior phone, that allows for the latest Android and a fluid communication by any means (calling, messaging, socialing).",83,4
Motorola,"I'm very surprised by how speedy this little guy is. I'm able to accomplish most tasks with little trouble. I just pulled it out of the box about six hours ago, so I can't comment on battery life much. So far it seems to be on par with my Moto X.The build quality of the phone is pretty great. Only thing that I wish was changed a little bit were how the buttons feel. They aren't wobbly thankfully, but they feel a little mushy. You don't get a satisfying click when you press them down.This phone's bootloader is unlockable through Motorola's developer portal, so this makes a great toy for those who like to tinker.Contrary to the official specs, this phone will work with 64 gig micro SD cards. YMMV, but I was able to pop it in and it worked immediately. I consider myself a power user and find that, between external and internal storage, I'm able to comfortably install every app I'd normally use.Keep in mind this phone is missing these features: Front facing camera, NFC, LED flash on the backIf you can deal with those missing perks, I can recommend this phone to most anyone that doesn't mind not having top of the line gear.",10,5
Motorola,"I've only played with the phone a bit (bought it as a gift for a family member), so this isn't a comprehensive review, but here's my verdict: the touch interface is responsive, the screen resolution is acceptable, Google Maps runs well, voice search/text is on par with the latest phones, and the phone feels solidly built. I have no input on battery life or durability at this point, but I have little doubt my family member will find this to be an impressive, if not completely adequate, first smartphone. (This is a three- or four-star phone overall, and there are much better phones out there, but I think this phone deserves a five-star rating for its value for the money.)",55,5
Motorola,"After playing with this phone for a while. I can say for certain that this is the best unlocked phone you can buy for $129. I will update the review as I get used to it.For starter, it is fast enough for most daily activities. more on that later...Some specs that most review are missing:Comes with a charging cable and power adapter but they are all one piece i.e., cable is attached to the adapter. If you need to plug it into PC then you need to get your own usb cable. Also on the downside, the adapter has a max rating of 550mA and is made in India which I wasn't expecting. The charger charges a bit slow which might be deliberately done to extend the battery life. I just plugged it into a different adapter and it is charging fast. Build quality of the phone is good and is just like Moto G if you have played around with it. Feels solid and it doesn't feel like the cheap Nokia 520 phone.Giving it 5 star due to its price and feature. If you are going to buy it then know its limitations!",37,5
Motorola,The Phone BOX Package was already opened before i opened the main AMAZON package. I am not sure really it is a new product or not. I am going to return it.I am totally unsatisfied with this one. I have attached the snap of it,12,1
Motorola,"For 129.00 can't be beat (unless the price dropped). The screen is quite good and no ""yellow"" fading in low light scenarios. One thing is that you NEED to use an SD Card from the START if you want to load a lot of applications. If insert after the fact it will be hard to move the data/applications over. In fact the Camera/Video will continue to use the internal memory. I would recommend everyone get at least an 8GB SD card to avoid the hassle of factory resetting (because it's simply faster than editing config files and moving apps one at a time).Cons: Bad Camera (compared to high end phones)No LED flashNO LTE Data(I live on e-mail so no biggie).Small Internal Storage (buy and SD card even for 10.00 dollars..it will save you the headache)THIS WILL NOT WORK with T-Mobile 3G service. Get the US version. If you are AT&T and/or travel the world this will work. If you spend most of your time in the US and don't travel....get the US version (it works with ATT 3G as well but not overseas 3G).",23,5
Motorola,"I purchased this phone to send to a relative overseas, but had a chance to test it for a day or so.Its hard to imagine any other phone at this price delivering a better user experience. The screen is vivid, bright, and quite sharp. The build quality is excellent. The back of the phone has a smooth, grippy feel usually found on more premium phones. The screen size is a little on the small side but has the advantage of being easy to use with one hand. The software and user experience is where this phone really shines. I prefer to use the pure android kitkat OS running on this MOTO E than a top of the lung Samsung or LG phone running a heavily customized skin of android full of carrier bloat apps. This phone handles typical smartphone functions like email, calendar, facebook, social media, and streaming media very smoothly. Google maps and google now ran smoothly. The battery life seemed quite good, but I didn't use it long enough to make a fair assessment.As mentioned by other reviewers, the only major drawback I find to this phone is the camera. I don't mind the lack of a front facing camera, but the lack of flash and the poor quality of the rear facing camera is what would keep me from using this as my daily phone. If capturing important moments with your phone camera is important to you, the consider paying the $50 or so dollars more to jump up to the Moto G which at least offers a flash.If you're strapped for cash or don't plan on using the camera frequently, than this is a solid option. However, given that the Moto G can be had for $50 more, I feel that the Moto G offers essentially a no-compromise user experience and would be worth the investment for most users. Either way you spin it, you're still paying a fraction of the cost of a premium handset on contract.",16,5
Motorola,"I've had a Smartphone for about two years, so I'm not one of those people who didn't like the ""Q"" because I expected PocketPC features on it. I switched from Cingular to Verizon for service reasons, and the Q seemed like the closest phone to the Audiovox SMT-5600 that I had and liked. It was definitely wider, but thinner, which seemed like a reasonable tradeoff.In my opinion, it turned out not to be. The phone was really too big to carry in a pocket easily. Once I decided that I needed to carry it on my belt, I decided to get the XV6700 instead. It's a lot thicker, but it has a slide-out keyboard with much bigger keys, plus a stylus/touchscreen and the PocketPC features. I'm very happy with that choice. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell that phone for Verizon (though they have the Sprint version).Other things I disliked about the Q:- The keys are impossibly small. I used a small blackberry for a long time and was fine with it, but some combination of the size and the feel of the keys made it very hard to use.- There are no dedicated keys for phone use. The whole point of a smartphone is to be a great phone first. Dialing a number on the Q is just plain hard to do. Finding the * and # keys is even harder! Finally, if you need to find any letter equivalents of the number keys, you're out of luck unless you've memorized them all.Good luck with whatever you purchase.",20,2
Motorola,"Even though the newer 2014 version is available this phone is a solid option if you want a great phone at an affordable price mainly because you get awesome premium features (and gimmicks) like touchless control and the great batery life, it also includes nice apps that make the user experience great. It may not be the best phone right now but it is an awesome bang for the buck and i enjo using it alot.",10,5
Motorola,"Ok first off this is a Moto X that does work perfect, that being said there is no way this is a new phone. It has an ATT logo on the back and has ATT preloaded software on it. That should not be the case if this is a factory unlocked phone from Motorola. Also the accessories inside are not Motorola branded, just random POS earbuds, and USB cable. I did make sure I purchased this straight from Amazon instead of a 3rd party seller too. It is unlocked though as I put my Tmobile SIM card in it and it works. So in the end, yes it works and it's unlocked but this is not a 'new' phone :( Can't recommend this be bought from here because it's not what it's advertised as.UPDATE: 5/21/14 I called Amazon about the phone not being a new phone and they apologized and they cross shipped me another with overnight shipping at no extra cost. The new one I received is an actual brand new Moto X from Motorola with no carrier branding, just how it was supposed to be.",46,2
Motorola,"I bought two of these about a month ago and I'm very impressed with this little phone. For users of Google services (gmail et al) the integration is quick and seamless. It's faster than I expected and provides all the functionality I need. The battery life is pretty good. For me it requires charging only every other day most of the time, although if used heavily it needs to be charged every day. I also like that it is factory unlocked (so can be used in most foreign countries easily) but came with a US warranty.",11,5
Motorola,"I received the phone box in shrink wrap. The phone was in mint condition. The charger and cable do have Motorola logo on them but they're black, as opposed to white shown in the picture. It didn't come with its own sim card ejection tool either so you gotta find yourself a needle. Another weird thing was, when I turn on the phone, it didn't prompt me through the whole ""setting up"" process. It simply went to the home screen, as if someone already set it up before me. Back then I didn't think it was that big of a deal, yet turned out it was. Before I get into it, just want to first say that, there's pretty much nothing about the phone that I dislike. The phone is fast, snappy and very smooth when it comes to handling multi-tasking and such. The front camera has pretty decent, warm-colored, clear quality. The back camera is not the best i've used, yet not terrible either. Clear enough but not impressive. You get the idea...The call quality is great. Coming from a Nexus 4 user, the call quality is much better than my old phone. When I'm on speaker, the person on the other end don't even realize it. The quality is very clear with very minimal of background noises. The phone is 16gb as promised and NOT pre-loaded with bunch of useless apps that you'll end up deleting. The first day of using the phone I was very happy about it. Until I found one major problem about it, it has no mobile internet. I tried turning the mobile data button on and off several times, tried rebooting the phone numerous times. There's still NO mobile data. I went on internet and read several forum where people are discussing the same problems. It turned out I don't have the proper APN (Access Point Name) for this phone. My current carrier is T-mobile. And I've used several unlocked devices before with T-mobile and never had any problems. So this one had me do some extra work before I can get access to the internet I paid for. Considering that I like the phone so much, I was willing to do as much as I can to fix this problem. I started to manually input the APN for T-mobile USA. And for some odd reason, every single time I finish inputting every field and hit ""SAVE"", the thing never saves. Then I found out that I cannot make any changes for this single field called ""MNC"". The phone has it defaulted on 330, and with T-mobile, it needs to be mortified to 260. Every time I change it, the whole thing won't save. It simply disappears. Later, I read another article saying that I can manually mortify the file that comes with the phone with all the APN information. After it's been changed accordingly to my carrier, it should be able to work. However, I cannot get access with the file without having the phone rooted. I could only read the file which did shown that T-mobile was not one of the carriers that the phone covers. So I gave up, I wasn't going to root the phone just so I can get access to my mobile data. So I factory reset the phone and planned to have it sent back. After I did that, the phone turned back on and was showing dialer screen immediately ask me to activate it. As it turned out, there's a number it automatically dials when you choose to have it activated. You won't even know what number it's calling. But you'll probably get a message saying ""your account is not authorized to make calls to this phone number"". So there, that's why when I first received the phone, it went to the home screen right away. Someone had to go in there to activate the phone with their own sim card I supposed, and it might just work for your carrier and it might not, like my situation. It's a shame I had to return it. It is still a great phone and I liked it very much. I would definitely keep it if it didn't cause me such trouble.",11,3
Motorola,you say that this phone is new but a lie is used and one side has a crack you are scammer,19,1
Motorola,"Ordered through Open Group Wireless and they sent me a XT-1092 model, which doesn't match the description at all! The XT-1092 is the European / Chinese version which doesn't have the correct basebands to do T-Mobile LTE. Beware of buying through Open Group Wireless.",23,1
Motorola,Make sure you do NOT buy from Open Group Wireless! Even though the model is shown as XT1095 I received an XT1092 which will NOT work properly (above 2G) on US GMS networks!I made the mistake of only looking at reviews after purchasing from them. Others have reported the same problem!,13,1
Motorola,"Excellent! Absolutely new XT1095, very beautiful with bamboo back cover. Powerful, with last Android version.",13,5
Motorola,"So I received the phone yesterday on a deal of the day special of $199 Amazon had this past week and thought ""Wow"" this is such a great deal until I realized it was only in 16gb. I thought really? They still make 16gb phones these days? Why? Well at least it has SD expansion and then realized it didn't. Once again, why not? If your only providing 16gb why not include SD expansion (makes no sense whatsoever).So I hesitated but thought well I can probably live with 16gb since I have cloud storage and a tablet with SD card so I pulled the trigger ($199 is had to pass up). I ordered the black leather edition and upon receiving it and holding it I was very pleased. It's beautiful to look at and hold and very well constructed as others have mentioned. The smell and feel of leather is unsurpassed by any other phone I have used prior (iPhones, Samsungs, LG's) the arched back design also allows for a superior hold in the hand.So all is well I thought, I'm loving it. I turned it on and immediately went to the storage capacity and I was blown away! Only 10.2 GB of available storage!!! What the hell how could this be? There must be some kind of mistake this is ridiculous! I was immediately prompted to update the software to Lollipop which I did and after updating all firmware and the outdated KitKat it came installed with and adding Whatsapp, CBS Sports and Slacker I was left with a repulsive 7.9 GB of available storage, I mean seriously this is a joke!How in the world does a 16gb device take up 6gb for the OS? Perhaps 2gb maybe 3 but 6? And if so why the hell isn't it advertised? Instead of 16gb it should be sold as ""10gb of usable storage"" I would have never purchased it...So yes the phone is pretty to look at and hold and yes the OS is stock android which craps on everything else but the usable storage of the Moto X is not reasonable and therefore I cannot recommend it especially if this is your go to phone and plan on having it for a while. With more apps, a few songs and constant app updates you will run out of storage in no time and your phone will begin to lag.If Moto is going to undercut the storage than at least provide an SD slot. Perhaps go for the 32gb or just get a Nexus. I mean really my LG Optimus G (E970) from 2012 is also 16gb, has a ton of AT&T and LG Bloatware and yet still has 11.8GB leftover of usable storage AND includes SD expansion and that's a 3 year old phone!!!",14,3
Motorola,"Phone was STOLEN, Verizon said it was a blacklisted stolen MEID number. Pathetic.",32,1
Motorola,"Phone description is completely wrong, this phone is NOT unlocked, nor is it GSM, it is a CDMA phone and requires a Verizon sim to work, the phone it self looked to be in good condition, and I can't comment on how well this one would function due to not going past the ""Verizon Sim"" required screen on start up, I previously had a Moto X and they are amazing! Hopefully after a few more orders I will find one that is TRUE to its posting",23,1
Motorola,"THIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED NOR GSM!!! Got this phone expecting unlovked, well it was not. Starts up Verizon and when I inserted my at&t sim card, start up screen said you must insert Verizon sim. DO NOT BUY, FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!",20,1
Motorola,This phone was NEW! The packaging was perfect! I had no trouble activating with verizon! So pleased with my new phone.,10,5
Motorola,"This phone is old hat now, a new moto x is here, and the competition have all gone through update cycles, and whereas this device was middle of the road in terms of specs, it's updated version is not, therefore no need to get this phone.... Or so I thought.I have rarely been this wrong in my assessment.PERFORMANCE: The 2013 moto x absolutely flies! It is smooth, and fast. Apps launch pretty fast, and you won't notice the difference until you use it side by side with the latest devices (and who does that anyways?) Magnificent stock interface, that uses the 2 GB ram very efficiently, and keep an eye on 3rd party apps that may prevent the phone from sleeping.SCREEN: Pretty screen, that's only 720p but still draws oohs and aahs when in whip it out, despite the critiques of Amoled screens, I have found no fault with it. I love the saturated colors, I love the deep blacks, and it feels like the screen is painted directly on the glass. it becomes slightly difficult to read outdoors in bright sunlight occasionally, especially if you wear sunglasses.PHYSICAL: The phone itself is the perfect size, slim bezels and rounded back make it very ergonomic. The weight is well balanced and feels substantial and high quality and dense without feeling cumbersome.CAMERA: The camera isn't top of thee line in terms of performance, but it is good enough. And if you're patient enough you can get most excellent results from the optics. it is obvious when you use it that the lens was built to draw in more light, but that sometimes backfires, at night it becomes very noisy and the color balance trends to oscillate wildly in the dark unless you focus and expose it manually. During the day, the same lens often washes out colors if not focused properly. But if you manual focus, the picture is very good. Auto HDR is available as an option which automatically attempts to reduce this issue by merging multiple exposures into a 'perfect' exposure value. And while the HDR is a little aggressive, it works pretty well to mitigate these issues. The flash is bright but very cool in color. A SIDE NOTE: two stand out features of the camera that I found in my use were; 1. Most excellent macro capabilities (one of a kind) 2. The wrist twist gesture to launch the camera from sleep is quick and works like a charm, launching the camera mere moments later (life saver).SPEAKER/CALL QUALITY: The main speaker is loud and clear, but can get muffled occasionally if put on its back. But it has good clarity. The earpiece speaker is also clear and loud, and calls generally sounded crystal clear and without echoes or static.BATTERY LIFE: heavy user? You'll have to charge it 1.25 times daily. It is sufficient for about 12-14 hours of use. But you'll have to give it a short supplementary charge in the middle of the day. Moderate to light user? You'll get through the day easily, with about 15-16 hours of use.",29,5
Motorola,I received an XT1058 in an odd box (not the original Motorola Box) which makes me think this is not a new phone. The XT1058 does NOT work on Verizon! The phone I received even has AT&T branding on the back of it. The seller needs to either ship the correct item or change the item description. Think stinks because I was counting on having this phone for my wife before our vacation tomorrow and now I have no phone for her. I would not recommend this seller.,25,1
Motorola,"Very disappointed. I was looking for an AT&T compatible phone. This is advertised as an unlocked GSM phone (which is compatible), but I received a Verizon phone, which is CDMA. It ""works"", but a lot of the functionality does not work, it has low bars of service, and is on an "" H"" network rather than 4G LTE. The phone I received even had the name Verizon written across it, which is not as advertised.",14,1
Motorola,"I bought this on a whim. My dad's cell phone has a big crack in the screen so I figured I would upgrade him into something new. He's not a big gadget guy so there was no need for features like a camera or bluetooth or even a color screen for that matter.When I received the box I was a little shocked. First thing I noticed is the manual was in Spanish. This wasn't a big deal to me. I searched the web and found an English manual to download. This could really annoy others expecting a better out of box experience. The next thing that caught me off guard was the default language; it was also Spanish. Again, no biggie because the phone ""speaks"" to you when you power it up and asks you what language you want to select. Pressing ""3"" sets the language to English and you're set.Once powered on you can choose to keep the phone in ""Voice Guidance"" mode. This is actually a really user-friendly feature. After you push the Menu button (located to the left of the navigation pad) you can navigate through menu items with the pad and the voice tells you what menu item you are on. This totally makes up for the B/W screen and lackluster icons.Overall this is a great entry-level or emergency phone. The call quality rivals any phone I've used. Volume was loud and clarity was near-perfect.Pros:- Great signal strength- Crystal clear calling- Solid battery life- Slim profile looks more sophisticated than it really is- Speakerphone (press Menu button twice when on a call)- Voice guidanceCons:- Spanish manual and default language- Low-res, monochrome LCD screen (See customer images)- No modern bells or whistles- Kinda plasticky feeling- Not for TextersFor the price (Sub-$40) this can't be beat. Just make sure you know what you are getting into before you buy it.Only 4-stars due to the whole Spanish manual/language thing.",141,4
Motorola,"This is good phone. It is a phone, not an operating control for the space shuttle.the phone arrived in the appropriate cannister, but it seemed that it had been tampered with. at least it appeared to have been glued together. after one month of use the phone has come apart. I believe this is a recycled phone and so I would not recommend that you buy from this company.finally, the phone is quite flimsy, if you put in in your pocket it will crack, if you drop it, it will break. love the epaper, disappointed with the fragility of the thing. imagine you are in the thirld world (the phone is designed to sell in poor asian and african markets), you put together a month worth of savings to buy this phone. then while carrying out your daily labors the phone cracks, which is very easy to do...can you imagine the heartbreak.I will not rebuy this phone model, although I love MOTOROLA.",10,1
Motorola,"Hi!! Just wanted to add my opinion regarding this phone. Don't buy it!I read ALL the reviews prior to purchase and was completely prepared for a barebone phone, no bells, no whistles...PERFECT. What I received was a phone that was not unlocked. It was branded TIGO thus requireing a pin subscription to access AND did not recognize my AT&T/Cingulair Sims card. After hours on line, a useless Motorola rep and AT&T and no solution in sight...the phone is being returned. If Motorola can't even figure out how to address the start up issues....and it's their phone....that's beyond ridiculous! They recommended that I mail my NEW phone to them so that they can reset the system to one that I could use. Thanks but no thanks! I'm returning the phone and going to BestBuy to grab me an inexpensive disposable phone until my contract expires.Just hope I can save someone else all this hassle!If you order this phone there are no guarantees that it will be an UNLOCKED phone that you can use in the United States.Buyer BEWARE!!!",31,1
Motorola,"All I wanted was a simple phone that worked well and didn't cost a lot of money. That is exactly what I got with the Motofone F3. The phone I received was originally intended for use in Mexico and the box had been opened, but the phone was in new condition. I inserted my AT&T SIM card, powered the phone up and was greeted by a voice prompt instructing me to press 1 for English. After setting the time and date the phone was ready to use.I was pleased that the Motofone F3 got better reception in my signal-challenged house than my old Samsung phone. My phone is my watch, so I appreciate that the time is clearly visible on the electronic ink display. A quick internet search will provide a list of configuration codes that can be used to modify phone settings.Motorola developed this phone for use in emerging markets, so the simple menu system is based on icons and optional voice prompts assist navigation. I haven't disassembled the phone, but it feels like the internal electronics are shock-mounted. The phone fits in my hand well and is solidly built. I like its ease of use, good call quality, speakerphone and long battery life. The one feature I do wish it had is mute. This phone is capable of text messaging, but I don't consider it suitable for anything but occasional use.If you like camera phones, phones as fasion accessories or do a lot of texting this phone is not for you. But if you need a simple, low-cost phone, this one is worth considering.",29,5
Motorola,"This phone is hard-to-find-common-sense approach in design and technology. I have never seen better phone. This is not a gadget that makes your life miserable because you need to worry every day that batteries are charged or you need to spend 1/2 day on setup or figuring out why current time does not show on screen. If you need features behind phone, get Apple iPhone if you need just a cell phone, get Motorola F3.",29,5
Motorola,"I discovered this phone's existence online. Once again, thanks to Amazon's unparalleled customer review knowledge base, I got the skinny and knew what I was in for. I wanted a phone with a screen that was READABLE. Due to limitations in technology (LCD) and biology (my need for reading glasses), the screen of my little Nokia is only visible when cupped in my hands in a darkened theater. And even that low-budget phone has too much JUNK to wade through. (I don't care to do Internet shopping by phone, thanks though) The Motofone F3 does what a phone is supposed to do - it lets you TALK to people quickly and easily. It's Electronic Ink screen is amazing - you REALLY CAN read it in broad daylight. Why isn't any other phone using this technology?If you're interested, please do read the reviews. These phones are not marketed in the USA it seems - I guess we are collectively just too hip and sophisticated for this quaint little thing. Mine came ""unlocked"" as advertised - I just transplanted the SIM card from my old phone and I was ready to go. You have to choose your preferred language, and if you want a manual for the dozen or less functions, you can download it easily from Motorola.Some of the negative reviews are gut-busters. Did these folks even READ about the phone they were getting? Maybe it was a gift, I don't know. ""Box was opened!""? That's because they're pulling these from South America or India and unlocking them for you! ""Has a crappy interface!""? It does look like Etch a Sketch, but hey, I don't care to have all my friends' avatars on my screen. I can speed dial about 15 numbers. And you CAN send and receive text, if'n you really have to, though I don't think I ever will. (So counterintuitive... that's why God invented keyboards!) ""Phone has no color screen! / no MP3 player! / no camera!"" etc... Well, if that's what you want, you don't want this phone. I told all my higher-tech friends that I just got two ""Third World Phones"" - and my wife and I love them.Note: apparently some folks did not get ""unlocked"" phones or had other technical problems. I was lucky in that regard. (May have been a different vender.) Also make sure your phone plan uses compatible technology. Amazon has a little chart at the top of the page to help you with this too. Thanks Amazon, and Vibe Cellular, for letting me make an informed decision. It's the cell phone I've always wanted.",23,5
Motorola,"This cell phone looks great. The display is very bright and colorful. The 2Gb of memory is good enough if you enjoy music and the 2mega pixel camera is ok. I would give 5 stars to this phone if wasn't because of one major problem: It's incredible slow. It takes so much time to execute many single tasks like searching your phone list for example. Even navigate the menu can be painful cause sometimes it takes a while to change from one option to another (I usually click lots of time and it suddenly goes beyond the point I wanted.) Seriously, if you don't have patience don't buy this phone. I have, many times, wanted to just throw this phone at the wall. Anyway, like I said, if you don't mind, it's a good phone.",12,3
Motorola,"This phone is a monster! Everything from the construction quality to the speed of the hardware is astonishing! Having rooted the phone, I have lowered the processor clock speed to nearly half of its stock potential with no noticeable difference in performance. Additionally, the camera is very impressive, being able to take photos that are higher quality than some digital cameras. Again, I have my phone rooted, but the camera can be set to film videos in 4k resolution! Overall this phone is much more than I expected. 10/10 I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a powerful android phone.",11,5
Motorola,"The phone came as promised, when promised. It was in new condition (still had plastic on it, still in box and everything, no scratches anywhere). Regarding this phone specifically, I like it for the physical keyboard, and if that's important to you and you're on Sprint, then there's really no choice. The physical keyboard itself is comfortable and the phone is fast enough for my needs.I have two minor complaints with my experience:1 - the physical keyboard has a tendency to type double letters. You press the letter once, then two letters are entered. I found that pressing down all the letters hard resolved this somewhat, but it still happens occasionally, and it's annoying. I think this is an issue with the phone model, as I had an identical phone, and this was an issue with it as well. My other phone also had no vibrate feature (the hardware that makes it vibrate was broken from day 1). I've read online that this can be an issue with these phones. This particular phone didn't have that issue, but it's worth being aware of.2 - there were a few headaches with activation - this is a Sprint issue. Once you activate, you may find that you can now place calls, but can't receive any calls or text. This also happened with my other phone. You'll have to call Sprint tech support so they can resolve their network issues. It's a quick call, so no huge deal, just worth knowing about.",11,4
Motorola,"i Love this phone! i'm a keyboard person because i find them alot more efficient and since this has a wide keyboard as well as sype, is quick, easy to use and has very functional features. i also find larger phones are easier to hold on to and i tend to drop less and this phone is kind of a tank lol. i really have No Cons for this phone which is odd for me to say because i'm not one to say i 'love this phone'. but i do this one.",13,5
Motorola,"First and foremost what I look for in a cell phone is functionality. In that I mean its abilities to make and recieve calls.I've read that this Razr recieved the most sophisticated antenna ever put into a Moto phone. I believe that hands down. I rarely lose a signal and calls sound near perfect most of the time.The camera is good, not great, but good. Much, much better than my old Sanyo SCP-8100 (Sprint). The digital zoom works flawlessly and leaves no pixelation when zoomed (a common problem with dig. zooms) very clear. A friends Sanyo SCH-a670 leaves great pixelation when zoomed. Better software in the Moto I assume.Speaking of software I highly recommend the Moto Phone Tools 3.0! I bought this with my Razr because I knew I wanted to pimp my phone to the max. It works awesome! All those MP3 ringtones I use to Download for $3 a pop - gone. I make my own wallpapers and MP3 ringtones now. For free. Plus when you plug the phone to your USB port on your PC it also acts as a charger! Charging the battery as you load media onto your cell.The bluetooth works flawlessly as well. I bought the Motorola HS850 headset. The calls are crystal clear. You could answer and make calls while never opening your phone. The voice dialing works superbly on the Razr.This is a quad (4) band GSM world phone. You could go to Japan and use this thing.*EDIT* this phone STILL works awesomely. It has been handed down to another family member and then rehanded down to another family member. It continues to be a true Die-Hard! Like the Toyota of cell's - but without the sticky throttle thing. :PThis Razr could also be used as a modem to connect you laptop or desktop to the internet. Anywhere theres a GSM signal. A nice feature I thought. Especially for gadget freaks.The internal color screen is the best I've ever seen on a phone to this date. No kidding. Bright and vibrant. Some of my wallpapers seem to be 3-D.The phone is very thin and light. When opened it fits naturally to your face. Just the right size. Earpiece to ear, mouthpiece to mouth.Pro'sClear calls, great antenna.Good cameraWorld phoneCan store 1000+ phone numbersCan be used as a PC modemAwesome internal color screenBattery lifeBlutoothVery thin and lightVoice dialingMany customizable featuresConsNo expandable media slotNo video capability (Cingular) without hacking the phoneNo dedicated media buttons.All in all I'm thrilled with the phone. Next year Motorola is releasing a Razr V3x. 2 MP camera (external), video calls (with a seperate inner-hinge video cam, expandable media slot, List price @ $900. You should probably expect deals for $400 - $500 in the stores.",197,5
Motorola,"The Motorola RAZR V3 is worst cell phone I have ever had. The only nice feature is the camera and there are a lot of other cell phones with better features that have cameras too. Also beware of the so-called rebate. If you don't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it, well go for it but if your time is money, run from this rebate and this phone. 5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool, hip cell phone. How wrong we all were. Cingular is fine. They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us. 3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates. The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops. One mistake and you are screwed out of the $150 rebate.Another problem with the phone and it's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look. All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.I have never written a review before on Amazon or otherwise, but I feel that people should be aware that the cool, hip advertising of the RAZR is not what it is cracked up to be.",10,2
Motorola,"Short review - if you actually want what this phone only promises, do yourself a favor and buy a SidekickLong review:Pros:One - It's a cool looking phoneOK, that, and battery life on standby - over 7 daysCons:- menu interface from ""heck"" - common functions are ""10 clicks deep""- no sync - if you want it on your phone you're going to enter it via the 10-digit keypad (or possibly pay an additional $30 for whatever software Motorola offers, but I never looked at it) The USB interface does nothing for you.- charging - it has a mini-USB interface to doesn't charge via USB (???? or mine was broken - dunno 'cause I sent it back)- every single data bit that passes from the phone is billed against your data account- it's not that good of a phone (at making decent phone calls)- it's worthless as a chat tool, web browser, or email tool- it's marginal as a cameraIf you have to have the coolest phone on the block then this is the device for you.If you want an actual useful piece of gear, or one that doesn't have outrageous charges to get the full functionality offered look elsewhere.Every piece of contact information has to be entered manually because as far as I can see there's no software included with the phone for Sync. Motorola will sell you some $30 add-on (to a $400 phone - how awesome!) that appears to offer management of pictures and sounds, but I see no mention of actual useful phone data entry.Issues I had with my phone -It made terrible phone calls - particularly when calling my home number. There was a constant, electronic chatter - and calling my number with another cell immediately showed no issues with the line. This happened every time i called.The impossible mountain of moving my contacts to a new device - All of my contacts have multiple phone numbers, email addresses, and in some cases URLs. According to Cingular (as they are the only ones I talked to) there is no way to sync this data to the phone - it all hs to get punched in via the 10-digit keypad. This is insane for a phone of this pricetag.The use of my ""data plan"" - I was astounded to see that every single action you take with this phone from a ""data"" perspective is billed against your account. Yep - signing on to and off of AOL COSTS YOU BITS. This is insane. That, coupled with the actual limit to the number of messages you can send before insane charges occur in just another part of how Singular (and other carriers) are ""doing it wrong"" with ""extended data devices"" like this phone. On my Sidekick I message, browse, and email to my hearts content without every worrying about my current ""bit count"" and what's going to show up on my bill.Lastly -It just died - when I when to actually try and use the phone again after my first week of ownership, I found the phone dead, unwilling to power on. Charging for day did nothing.I may have gotten a lemmon, which is why I did not comment on the Bluetooth - but it took about 40 attempts to get my (also new) Motorola headset to sync with this phone.In re: BT - I will say that it's an unbelievably poor thought-out number of key-clicks to toggle bluetooth on & off - like a dozen.I sent this thing back - it's worthless. I'm replacing my 3-year old Sidekick (one) with a Sidekick 2. I think once you've gotten used to a QWERTY device you can't ever go back to entering data via a 10-key.Don",44,1

Motorola,"I recently bought this phone from Amazon because of the $150 rebate. I am very disappointed with my black RAZR V3. I like the look of the phone and some of the features like the hands-free speaker which is loud and clear. But a cell phone's basic feature is to connect to other people, but it fails in delivering this very basic need. I did not purchase this phone for the bell and whistles, just to make and receive calls.One of the most irritating things about this phone is I find myself constantly having to clean my fingerprints and smudges off the screens. Also my 1st day at work I started to notice that my RAZR phone interfered with my work telephone, the telephones of my co-workers and my portable radio. Therefore I have to turn my phone off at work as no to cause problems. When in my car it interferes with my car radio, at home it interferes with my home telephone, stereo, television, etc.My biggest disappointment is that the ear volume of the phone is ""TOO LOW"" even though it is set at the maximum volume I can barley here a conversation. I called Motorola to inquire about the volume and could not here or understand the tech person.The only good thing I like about my black RAZR V3 is the speakerphone capability. Needless to say I will be returning this phone. I should have kept my old Sony phone.",11,2
Motorola,"Ordered the phone on Sunday received by Thursday. First the phone, it's a nice looking phone but that's where it pretty much stops, Motorola is very behind on the features they offer for phones and the display has been the same for the past atleast 10 years since I had my first Motorola, the phones that offer the best features for wallpaper, color schemes is LG, there phone features are awesome. Now on Cingular service this was my first time signing up, when I first got the phone I kept getting unregestired sim, called the first lady said the phone was defective so I contacted Amazon(a new phone is on the way) called Cingular again another lady said it could be the phone or sim card, happened to come on here and read reviews and saw where someone else had the same problem, he said he contact cingular tech support and they were able to help, I called and spoke with someone and tech support(thanks, it worked...kinda) anyway the tech support person said they where having problems with there towers that the werent regesiter new customers???makes no since to me, anyway she said I would need to keep turning my phone on and off until it picks it up...well eventually that worked but I can't believe you would have to go through all that with a cell phone company just to get to service...that sucks big time!! I had tmobile before and compared to the problems I had with them they don't even compare to the problems I've had with Cingular for just a day of service. So all in all I would just get the silver razr through tmobile and only have a 1 year contract as oppossed to a 2 year contract w/Cingular. I still have about 20 or so more days before I decide if I want to stick with Cingular or kick them to the curb!!",11,3
Motorola,"I just got one of these, and my impression so far is a positive one. Since there are already numerous reviews on what's good about it, so I will focus on what I didn't like...The phone advertises that it can be charged via USB. This, however, cannot be done unless you purchase a USB cable and their phone tools software separately ($30 for the latter). Also, the ""custom wallpaper"" and ""MP3 ringtones"" are also misleading. Either you purchase their Mobile PhoneTools software, or the only way to get ""custom"" wallpapers and ringtones is to pay individually for each one.The user interface is also terrible. It looks pretty (colorful backgrounds and icons), but it is not especially functional. The menus are all slow to respond (upwards of a quarter-second delay after every key press), and with the default settings, you spend more time fumbling through the oversized icons than actually performing the desired tasks. The phone book is especially awful. Rather than adopting a heirarchial phone book system, they keep it flat (ie. one entry per number). There are some workarounds to this, but even then, they lack the simple yet efficient system adopted by Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, and others.Finally, the memory... all whopping 5MB of it. There's about 1MB of crappy animated backgrounds and unwanted ringtones that you cannot delete as well, and no room for expansion memory (eg. flash memory devices). With flash memory at less than $20 for 256MB, I don't understand why Motorola would only put 5MB in their high-end phone (originally listed at $500+). Between the camera, custom wallpapers and ringtones (if you shell out the cash for them), and other media, that 5MB is really inadequate.",12,4
Motorola,"I have this phone for a few days and I really like it so far. All my friends and co-workers think it's coolest phone they ever seen (...).The Amazon's instruction came with the phone said put in the sim card and battery in the phone, wait 15 min then it should work. I left the phone overnight, next morning the phone still said ""unregister sim"". I called Cingular custumor service, she couldn't get it to work either so she transfered me to another Cingular technical support. The technical support person got it working in 5 min. Actually, I prefer to call Cingular customer service to activate the phone because who knows the phone might get lost in the mail, you know what i mean.If you are planning to transfer your phone number from the current service (home phone or cellphone) to your new cell phone plan then forget about it. Amazon website said currently they don't have any way to do this for Cingular. You could call Cingular to transfer the number for you, but this requires Cingular to cancel the plan you openned with Amazon and create a new plan. (...) CHECK WITH AMAZON",14,4
Motorola,"Just recently I bought this phone. I received it 2 weeks from the date I order. Amazon did not ship until 9 days, though it says ""usually ships in 24 hrs"" . But it did not bother me though.The phone looks sleek and sexy. Everyone around me think it is coolest phone ever. I am getting compliments from all over.I did not have any problems, just opened the box, charged the phone, put in the SIM and with in a minute started talking.The phone menu is little confusing, but once you get used to it , you should be fine.I hate this menu within the menu options. Sometimes i dont notice these smmall menu icon display which indicates that there is one more level of menu to the existing item.. Grrr....As for as car charger and USB cable is concerned, dont waste your money. I bought a belkin car charger(47.99) and belkin mini B USB cable ($4.65) from walmart. Search for it in the Audio section of walmart.Will write again",14,4

Motorola,"I've had this phone for about 4 months. (I got it when it first came out.) I love it. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the screen constantly looks smudged, and I am forever wiping it. For those of you having battery trouble, I ""thought"" I did at first too. The problem is that when you leave it on Bluetooth, it drains the battery really fast. That is because the phone is constantly in ""on"" mode. Turn off the bluetooth when you aren't using it and you will be surprised how much longer the battery lasts.",17,4
Motorola,The battery is not charging. I have put in a new battery too and it still did not charge and makes me believe phone is defective.,13,1
Motorola,"Got the phone yesterday and it was a nice looking phone. Exactly what i wanted. Heres the but.... The battery was warped. Very noticeably warped. Almost ready to explode. I threw it back in the box as quickly as i could, sealed it back and now i have to return it which will probably be such a hassle. I guess i could just purchase another battery to keep from having to go thru that headache. Motorola is really at fault though.",14,1

Bad news, all the documentation including the manual was in Spanish. I had to go online to read the US manual. Also no leather carrying case as advertised.On the plus side. I received a USB cable along with PC software to link my outlook address book and pics/videos easily to the phone.The phone is very cool.",11,4
Motorola,"Well after my free phone from cingular broke I was stuck, they were not able to offer me any kind of deal until my 2 year contract was up. I really wanted a razr so I went looking. This was the cheapest one I could find so I went for it. It came with the euro charger, but it had a small adpater that made it fit the american outlets.",11,5
Motorola,"Stylish AND works great! What a concept. The clarity and reception on this phone really blows me away. I can actually hear the conversation when driving in the car!The price is high and I recommend getting a case. Amazon lists it as coming with a leather case, but I did not receive one. (**update: Amazon did in fact send me a case for the phone after I inquired about it. It didn't fit though. I ended up paying almost 30.00 for one at the Cingular store.) As of yet, they have not got back to me regarding that matter. A little deceptive about what comes with it, (cases are expensive) but it does not take anything from the phone itself.I love it!(UPDATE*** Also, now that I have had the phone for a while, I wanted to state that some people have stated the battery life isn't good with this phone. I have had NO problems at all and today is #5 that it hasn't been on the charger.)",13,5
Motorola,"When my old AT&T phone broke, I did not want to extended the AT&T contract. So I purchased my 1st unlocked phone, and it was very easy to use on the current AT&T rate plan. When your new in the box phone arrives, all you do is save your phone numbers to the SIM card in the old phone, remove the SIM card from the old phone, insert the SIM card into the new phone, power on the new phone, and it works on your current AT&T rate plan with your old phone number. This phone is great for every normal cell phone function, but is lacking on the ability to save other information in a notes type file for non phone functions. Go online to the Motorola Web Site and download the complete user manual for how to use all phone features. Final analysis when used as a cell phone 5 stars, when used as an advanced mobile information device 3 stars.",12,5
Motorola,"I love the RAZR. I have had one for years. I wanted an upgrade and selected the RAZR V3. The first phone delivered did not live up to RAZR standards. I contacted the company and worked with Erin, their rep. I exchanged the phone at no cost to me. The new phone has excellent reception, I do not have to use the speaker for people to hear me (this was my main problem with the old phone). I also had a phone book problem which was corrected by the exchange.My suggestion to anyone who wants an inexpensive phone is to try this one. If it does not work out for you, call the company and give them a chance to fix the problem. If you would rather return the phone you will be offered a full refund. The choice was mine and I gave them a second chance. They made things right.",23,5

Motorola,"In the past, Motorola used to make these phones, and they were very well-made too.

They were cheaper, but they are not the same quality anymore. All the phones I tried to buy, all came with sharp corners and edges, had badly-aligned battery covers, etc.I've more or less given up trying to find a genuine Razr V3i.",10,1
Motorola,"I was very pleased with the item. When the comments are mint condition and refurbished in brand new housing, it usually is anything but that. This was the exception.

Very disappointed, I bought these phones for my aging parents and wanted to get them a simply phone to operated.

Motorola,"The Motorola Tundra is a great phone! It's been 4 months in my possession now and has seen some tough times, including putting me through the most embarrassing situation of my life. I work as an IT Manager and required a cell phone that would take a licking and keep on ticking. I brought the Tundra with a clip-on holder for the phone and my thinking at the time was quick access instead of a leather case that would wear down in no time.The Tundra has fallen many times in the short 4 months and in one case while passing between two people, one was holding her door open with her elbow sticking out. The Antenna on the Tundra somehow managed to hook on her elbow and fall out of the holder. I should have simply let the phone fall to the ground instead of trying to prevent it from falling, to the ground. I honestly don't know how I managed to grab a hold of this woman's ass three, or four times in the process of trying to catch my phone mid-air. Clearly, I was red with embarrassment and I could see she felt sorry for me and now I don't have to be on that show, ""I Shouldn't Be Alive!""The Tundra's software, though basic is very well thought out and easily allows you to select the desired functions without needing to guess at the next step.The Tundra is hard pressed to loose signal and I have never missed a call. In Network Settings, the Tundra allows you to turn on Service Tone which alerts you when the phone has either lost signal and regained signal.The Tundra also allows you to set up to three different Alarms with very flexible parameters, including days of the week, weekends, etc.The Tundra's contact address book is not at all disappointing and gives you the ability to enter a wealth of information on your contacts while integrating itself very well with both incoming, outgoing and missed calls.Now, while my colleagues point, laugh, and joke about how I have to find a corner to answer my phone, I'm comfortable with the idea that the Tundra accepts and knows it's primary function is to be a Cell Phone and a tough one at that. I'm down with that.",29,4

Motorola,"I wanted a phone that had good battery life, a reasonable form factor and was dependable; I have a camera and mp3 player, so I don't need them on my phone as well. My previous phone was a terrific Sony Ericsson W810, but lost the battle with the washing machine...The unlocked Motorola V197 set up with no problems with my ATT sim card and connected easily with Motorola Bluetooth. I have had no problems and the battery life is very, very good, as is the reception. If you want a phone that is simply a phone, I can highly recommend this one.",59,5
Motorola,"I bought this unlocked Motorola V197 cell phone in conjunction with a Motorola Bluetooth hands free visor clip, for my driving. They work great individually and together. After examining my own needs and reading the reviews of others, I took a chance on this phone. Reviews indicated it had a long battery life, good reception and initialized easily with a Cingular/AT&T SIM card. Yeah! Set up was easy. (Thank you!) Reception is surprisingly better than my old phone, a big plus. The speaker feature of this phone was required and the hands free function of a Bluetooth seemed like a nice bonus. The Bluetooth has turned out better than expected. It's easy to use with good transmission and reception. It was a good choice for me. Amazon has always been great. Their secondary sales vendors have also proven to be consistently superb. Thanks Amazon.",32,5
Motorola,"I ordered this phone just as a back-up to my current smartphone but I liked it so much that I used it as my primary phone for a few days. Size is nice and compact, fits well into any pocket. The battery life is phenomenal and that is expected because its a 1000+ mAh for a very basic phone. The features are decent and the bluetooth pairs very well with my external bluetooth devices such as the Motorola speakerphone in my car. Menu and options are basic and quite easy to use. Screen resolution is so-so but then what do you expect from a phone at this price. Overall, even though I went back to my smartphone a few days later (only because of my dependency on its features) I highly recommend this phone to those who need only voice + text. This is an excellent device and I will be more than happy to use it again if I ever need a back-up phone or if I go out on one of those rough outdoor adventures.",12,5
Motorola,"Motorola V197 Unlocked Cell Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Charcoal)Don't even consider buying from Amazon.com.

Motorola,"I recently upgraded to the Motorola XT890 RAZR after going through three Blackberry phones in five years. I have had this new phone for two weeks now and it has absolutely surpassed my expectations in every aspect.This phone is the international unlocked version of the current Motorola RAZR M, which is only carried by Verizon in the US. However, the Razr i works with GSM carriers (i.e. T-mobile and AT&T). Works with micro-SIM card. With T-mobile in the US, it runs on 3G when not on WiFi. Not sure about 4G yet, but definitely not 4G LTE compatible per Motorola specifications. I was a bit skeptical to purchase such an expensive unlocked product online and not really knowing for sure if it would have glitches or function properly in the US, but I'm so glad I took the risk.A few highlights/reviews on various features:CALLS: crystal clear reception on both ends and great speaker phone, even on the road. The rings tones are nice and pleasant.TEXTING: SWYPE feature may be enabled and disabled, but available. In any texting mode, very responsive keyboard. Even for the user who is not accustomed to a touch screen, it is super easy as the keys ""pop"" out on the screen and eliminate ""fat finger"" syndrome.CAMERA: HD-quality (back facing) and decent quality for (front facing - i.e. self portraits). Impressive and clear shots, and I dare say close to my brother's LG Optimus G, which has the highest photo quality on the market currently at 13MP. The video quality is pretty nice too. The camera feature is also well done in that it has its own ""quick access"" button on the lower right edge, so you don't have to ""dig"" to find it. Really nice for those spontaneous, unexpected photos ops, which of course always happen when one is not ready!QUALITY/BUILD: Corning Gorilla glass touch screen. Looks and feels durable.Does not feel flimsy by any means. Probably could get away without a case/back cover, but probably not a bad idea to have a screen protector to reduce smudges and fingerprints.FEEL: one of the few ""one-handed"" devices out there. Nice and thin, probably more comparable to the iPhone 4, in terms of overall size.APPS: Does not come with an overwhelming number of Apps, which is nice because you can build up your Apps list and customize from scratch.ALARMS: It has as many options as you need, which is nice for varying workdays and weekends. Also, overall pleasant alarm sounds, which is nice. (But that is coming from the Blackberry, so my perception is skewed and anything really sounds better having said that.)BATTERY LIFE: Fairly decent. This was very important to me, personally, and not many IT reviews focused too much on this so I'll go into more detail for those interested. Today, for example, I spoke on the phone for 1.5 hours total, played Pandora for about 2 hours, sent and received about 15 texts (some days up to 30-40), read about 10 emails, replied to 3 emails, and checked FB about three times...and the battery life is now about 40% left in the 12 hours of usage. You can always install an Android ""App Killer"" that terminates various Apps periodically that run in the background to optimize your battery life. Also, the product comes with a US wall plug, which the USB cord plugs into; that's nice since you can also go between wall or your laptop/PC to charge. Also, the phone is sent with a UK plug/adapter as well (also USB compatible), so that's handy for a trip abroad.In conclusion, if you're looking for a durable, high-quality, practical phone, and you're disappointed because GSM providers here in the US don't carry the Motorola Razr devices, then this is the perfect workaround solution! I absolutely adore this phone, best choice for me. Thanks for reading, hope this helps a bit.UPDATE: August 18, 2013Still very pleased with this phone! I installed Dropbox the other day, and used it to edit some documents in QuickOffice. Amazing! Just very responsive and fast! I haven't found a flaw with it yet, and I've used it for two months now.",20,5
Motorola,"I don't understand why Amazon is selling this phone as UNLOCKED when is NOT UNLOCKED, this phone is locked to Yoigo Spain, and unlock codes doesn't work because of some Yoigo problem.If you live in South America this phone will not work, yo have been warned, and the worst thing is that Amazon won't help you in any way, I wrote them about the problem and they told me to comunicate to Motorola, I did that via Mail and Motorola never responded me, then I told Amazon that Motorola didn't respond me and they also didn't respond, so I was left alone to solve this problem any way I can when it should be Amazon's obligaton to give me a solution. I have been a very good Amazon customer and I am really disapointed that after buying so many things from them, I didn't get any help, a very good customer as I, should't be treated that way!At first when I inserted my Sim card I got a message asking for a network code, but after trying many codes the message was gone and now I only get an Invalid Sim message, so now my only choice is to unlock it via software, so I have to pay an extra $35 to a store so my phone can be unlock via software, I just hope it works, otherwise I will have a very nice $500 mp3 player.So to resume don't buy this phone because it is NOT UNLOCKED and Amazon won't give you any help!At the end , there was no way to unlcok this phone, I tried everything and it wasn't posible!Also the phone was bought directly from Amazon.com LLC, not from a reseller.",84,1
Motorola,"I purchased the DROID RAZR last week and I like it a lot. Previously i owned a Nokia X6, which is also a terrific phone but a little slow by modern standards. I ordered it by standard shipping from Best n Price and surprise surprise.. they sent it the next day.. which was GREAT. I was a little skeptical as this phone is without warranty and looked a little expensive. Now,ABout the Droid Razr -Razr = Gorilla Glass + Kevlar + 7.1mm thick (or should i say SLIM) + 8MP camera, no need to say more about the build. Its nearly perfect.The Razr is pretty fast and the iphone looks dwarf as compared to this. The interface is also customized and pretty cool with the 5 home screens moving in a 3D. Apps on the Homescreens can be resized, removed by a quick hold and flick of the finger (Home screens are just too cool). Android phones are all about apps and there are plenty of cool and useful apps to be downloaded from the android market which is a great asset.MOTOCAST -I found Motocast, the software that can sync the Droid Razr and ur laptop, pretty interesting. In the beginning it takes sometime to get used to, but once u know how it works, makes just freakin cool to download and watch, listen anything thats on my laptop ANYWHERE, yes, ANYWHERE provided the laptop is ON.SMART ACTIONS -Yes, this is one of the most useful app in Moto Droid Razr. Customize and make own schedules to switch on Wifi, save battery by dimming brightness when not charging, change the ringtone volume, modify screen timeout automatically. All this works in a Trigger and Action fashion which is easy to understand and conserves a lot of manual effort. AWE***SOMEI tried skype on Wifi, video was great without lag but a little echo in sound. Processes and Tasks can be monitored with pre-installed apps, which I like to do even on my laptop.BATTERY-Yes, it takes you through a day easily but needs charge in the night.With all my daily tasks like Calls , Chatting (almost Whole day), browing in the evening or whenever i get time I can easily squeeze 12 -14 hrs from the Moto Droid Razr and be still left with 20% of the battery. Definitely a continuous use can drain it in 8 hrs. but the charging time is 1.5 hrs (Pretty less)SIGNAL STRENGTHI read in a review that the MOTO Razr can catch a signal in the most remote areas and the worst places. Voila, thats just what I wanted, I work in a place where I never used to get signal, but Droid Razr catches almost 3 - 4 bars. Sometimes it searches for the signal but very rarely. This is one of the best things about this Razr. Even the iphone (or any others I have seen with my colleagues) with a better service provider catches only 1-2 bars.PROS - Big screen, Connectivity, Build, Motocast, Smart actions, Interface, Cool Apps, Sound, Calls, Fastest shipping I have seenCONS - OS 2.3.5 (need the latest one ICS), No Micro SD card (with this model), Battery (could have been better), No warrantyI never write long reviews but this one deserves it.Simply said.. THIS is a great phone and worth every penny. I love my Razr.Edit:I received the ICS upgrade (Europe version) last evening and its been working great (I am in US). This phone is amazing after the ICS upgrade. Just a little heads up to anyone who is going to upgrade to ICS, the process (download and install) might take long (between 30 min to 2.5 hrs) but it will eventually upgrade and start the phone. My phone looked like it was stuck on ""Starting Applications"" screen for 2 hours but it finally worked and I am on ICS now.The RAZR just got a whole lot better. I will also recommend using the GO Launcher EX from Android market, it makes this phone simply awesome.More Update after 2 days of ICS use. I will keep this short -Pros:1. Better Battery Life (Under same conditions, earlier I used to have 40% at the end of day (10-11 hrs), now I was left with 60%)2. Amazing UI and the phone interface simply looks great. The whole experience is more Fluid.3. Feels more faster, i think there have been performance improvements.Cons:1. Task Manager is gone. There is no Default Task Manager. (Third party ones can be downloaded)2. Signal Strength has dropped one bar. (Still Its much better than a lot of major brand phones, my colleagues complain about signal loss, while i still enjoy signal in those places)TIP: Some people have complained that they cannot find option to ENABLE/DISABLE Background Data. The ""Restrict Background Data"" option is present in ""Data Usage"" Settings when options Key is pressed on the phone.(There is a bug while controlling this through Smart Actions, I encountered it once)Overall, from my viewpooint, they addressed major issues of battery life (i never had an issue here), better UI, higher performance. So, ICS is definitely recommended for Razr.",42,5
Motorola,"After about 3 weeks of use I've found this to be have quite a few shortcomings out of the box. With the help of a few apps and customizations it's turning out to be a great phone.PROS:1. Great display - great cross between tablet and phone. Great for watching videos.2. Extremely responsive touch3. Very fast4. Slim design and light - not too light as some suggest. I added a good case which made it a tad heavier and a bit more comfortable in the hands.5. Comes with a good deal of useable apps6. Pretty good camera - works well at night and very well during the day7. Decent video in the dark... haven't yet checked the daytime recording8. Good quality sound with headphones9. Motorola's Motocast software is great for accessing media from different computers. Once the software is installed on the relevant computers files can be accessed as long as all computers and phone have internet access. Greatly reduces the need to store files on the phone itself.10. Contact management is a breeze once contacts are available though an internet source11. Very useful widgets out of the boxCONS:1. Battery life is extremely short when gaming and using media (music, videos and such). There are a some good solutions I've found like using a very dim display brightness which helps tremendously but battery life is still very disappointing2. The default Android 2.x keyboard is unbelievably disappointing. Except for the fullstop simple things such as question marks and single uplifted commas have to be accessed by using the '?123' button. The keyboard layout isn't customizable so that unused keys can be replaced. Also, ten keys have a different long press function, the numeric keys. All others have nothing for long presses. How dumb is it to put simple stuff like question marks and commas in a separate screen and have about sixteen other keys with nothing for long presses?!3. Screen cannot be set to time out without requiring a slide to unlock. Don't know if I missed something but as much as I've tried once the display times out, I'm required to slide to unlock. Sometimes I just want the display off without a need to slide all the time4. Home screens cannot be removed or added5. Multi-tasking is un-intuitive except for the help of an app. Difficult to switch between running apps or to even see what's running. Thankfully that was fixed with an app.6. Have found that the touch becomes unresponsive occasionally. This hasn't happened often but when it does it's extremely annoying. Once I attempted to swipe to answer a call and it wouldn't repsons. Had to hit the power button before it responded.7. No recording software out of the box8. Boasts 16GB of storage with a 16GB micro SD card included but actually has 8GB usable storage and I got no micro SD card with mine (Unlocked version)9. Speaker leaves some to be desired10. Adding offline contacts is too difficultThat's all I can think of for now. Hopefully there will be a software update to address some of the issues mentioned above but still a good and fun phone. No regrets buying this one.JUNE 5th Update as requested:A couple more CONS of note:11. I is indeed ridiculous to have had paid over US$500 for the phone and it came without a warranty. Even if it is an international version.12. Where the options for the image galleries are many, for music playback it is very limited. Music files in the file browser cannot be added to playlists, even a currently playing queue. Also, when multiple music files are selected from the file browser, the only options are 'Download' and 'Open' and open opens a single file. Finally, no option to sort music by location.",13,4

Motorola,"I purchased this phone as a downgrade from a smartphone to a basic phone. I had owned this phone in the past and it was just as I remembered it to be. Simple and easy to use, yet very elegant looking. I must admit that purple is my favorite color and the first thing that attracted me to this phone when I saw it in the Verizon store a few years ago. But the fact that it is a solid sturdy quality phone makes it an even better purchase. I had no problem what so ever activating this phone on my existing Verizon account.. I recommend this phone to anyone needing a nice quality basic phone.I have read reviews that say battery life is bad, but I have had no problem with that as of yet I am still on my first charge after two days and it reads almost a full charge still. Sound quality is great during calls, clear and crisp on my end and no complaint from the other end when I asked.

I'm not so connected to media that I need an iPhone or Droid.

Motorola,"I purchased this phone in hopes of replacing my old razr from Verizon. I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new.I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network.$80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.",12,1
Motorola,"My sweetheart had one of these since 2005. Recently, the phone ceased being capable of charging its battery (even a new one). I secretly suspect that she had plugged an unauthorized charger into it, ruining the charger electronics. Her contract with Verizon was well past two years, so she was eligible for a free phone. We looked on Verizon.com and everywhere on the internet, but she could not find a phone like her pink Motorola RAZR phone. My sweetheart wanted a pink RAZR phone just like the one she had.This product filled the bill exactly. It is the spitting image of her old phone and every feature works great. It was thoroughly clean outside and all previous numbers and data had been removed inside.She loves her `new' (reconditioned) phone!My sweetheart is 76.",25,5

The phone is slim, still styleish after all these years and works PERFECTLY!! Razr has always been a good phone.DON'T BE STUPID and follow the negitive reviews, these are from clueless consumers who really don't know much about electronics. They are rating the shipping time of the phone and that is NOT what these reviews are for. Deal with it.PHONE RATING: 5 STARS.Keep in mind- these are OLD ELECTRONIC DEVICES!

Nokia,"This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability. The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.",12,5
Nokia,"First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a?ÿGino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug?ÿto use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.",12,4

Nokia,"This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.",17,5
Nokia,"This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price, but some potential buyers may not be fully aware of what to expect when it arrives.First off this phone is actually an unlocked AT&T Lumia 900, so there will be AT&T branding on the front. This means that the original packaging will already be opened, as the seller needs to manually unlock the phone before they ship it to you. This does NOT mean that it is a used phone. In order to be able to use non-AT&T sim cards, it is necessary for the seller to contact AT&T to receive an unlock code that frees it from the AT&T network. In my order, there was hardly any sign that it was handled at all, except for maybe a little finger print on the front glass. All the essential documents from AT&T and Nokia were inside the box, as well as a SIM ejector tool and a power cable.As is stated in the description, this phone will work on any HSPA/WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100 MHz/Quad-band data network and any GSM/GPRS/EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz cellular network, which in turn opens it for carriers in Europe and some in Asia. For US providers, there are currently only 2 major carriers that have GSM networks: AT&T and T-Mobile. There are other smaller carriers that offer services, but they utilize AT&T and T-Mobile towers in their coverage. These carriers include Straight Talk, Red Pocket Mobile, i Wireless, etc., and offer really affordable prepaid plans that I myself utilize. T-Mobile also offers a $30 a month prepaid plan that is rather reasonable.Unfortunately this phone will not work on any CDMA networks, which rules out Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular. For more information on the differences between CDMA and GSM networks, PCMAG.com has a fairly easy to read article explaining the differences between the two.Now onto the phone itself. I must say that I love this phone. It has a fairly decent Amoled 4.3 inch display, with a resolution of only 800x480. In our modern age of 1280??720 and above screens that may seem rather paltry. While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent. For me I use my iPad and laptop for watching videos so it doesn't matter to me all that much, but for others it may be a deal breaker.The build of the phone is absolutely fantastic. It is made of a solid polycarbonate body that is very resistant to scratches, with a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass. Needless to say, it is very sturdy. The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off. There is even a YouTube video where a hammer, saw and nail are taken to it and it comes up with little or no damage. The only thing on the phone that seems to be somewhat damageable is the metal piece around the camera lens. After less than 24 hours, there were already little scratches visible. For me I don't really care too much about it, but for others it may be really irritating.The camera itself is 8 megapixels with a Carl Zeiss lens, and it is just ok. There are certainly better phone cameras out there, with the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 blowing it out of the water. For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason.This phone uses Windows Phone 7.5 Mango, so it is not the brand new Windows Phone 8. Sad thing about this phone is that it will never receive an update to Windows Phone 8. The hardware is just unable to fully handle the new OS. Instead it will receive Windows Phone 7.8, which gives it some Windows Phone 8 functionality, such as resizable tiles and the like. But apps in the future will cater just to Windows Phone 8, meaning that those with 7.8 and below will be left out in the cold with newer apps. Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me but for many it will be.One of the things that attracted me to this phone is Nokia Drive. Unlike most smartphone map applications, it does not require data in order to run. Before you set out on a trip you download fully detailed maps onto your phone, and then the built in GPS chip is used to map your location on the map. You can even download state or country specific maps, so you save space by not downloading the entire US map pack. All of this is done without data usage, which is great if you are traveling abroad. Oh, and it is completely free of charge. For travelers like myself, this is an awesome feature. I am also a student, so having a mobile version of Microsoft Office in my pocket is absolutely wonderful, for it allows me to edit documents while on the go.Overall this is a fantastic phone but definitely shows its age (close to one year). However, its awesome build quality as well as fantastic applications for travelers made it a must have for me. It fits my needs well, but potential buyers will need to consider whether it will work well for them.",28,5
Nokia,"This is the best possible windows business phone. It even looks better than 950. Two sims is a dream. Finally, I don't have to run with two phones. It is fast enough, but not as smooth as 950. nothing freezes though. However, the battery sucks... It is brand new, I have to charge it during the day. Not a problem for me, but I would love to have it heavier/bigger, but with a decent battery.",13,4
Nokia,"Awesome phone! Here is my situation. I used to carry 2 phones at work, one for work, one personal. It got to be a pain, but due to the type of work I do, I don't really want to be giving out my personal cell number. With this phone, I put both SIM cards in and away I went. Syncs with Microsoft account and Exchange server at work.Pros: Text and phone messages can be sent on designated lines. Phone is fast and responsive. EXCELLENT camera! Syncs with Microsoft account. Huge 5 inch screen.Cons: Only one ring tone. Cant customize SIM ring tones. Edit: To clarify, the phone allows you to use as many ring tones as you would like. You can assign different ring tones to each contact. What I originally meant was, There is currently no way to give each SIM its own ring tone. Specifically to have SIM1 sound different from SIM2. I would like to be able to tell by the tone if the incoming call is from my personal or work line.",75,5
Nokia,"I specifically bought the international version, which the phone I received is not. It's an unlocked AT&T GO Phone for $80. You can buy the AT&T GO Phone for $55 and get the unlock code from AT&T for free (a simple google search will give you easy to follow instructions). So buy this phone knowing it's not dual sim, and it's not the true international version, and you're essentially paying an extra $25 for someone to get the code for you.",13,1
Nokia,"Well first I am a person who makes a review after a good couple of weeks of using it and in this case it was well over a couple of months. Also, I am very computer savvy person (if you know what I mean...)It is fast smooth and certainly feels like a great phone! The main downsides are that its an international version (thus does not work with 4G or LTE or 3G for that fact) but it still works with 2G (note: I use T-Mobile). Now I know there is a variant of a United States model of this phone which is called the RM-995 model version and that is another $100 more than this one (I bought this one for $350). Now I know its not fair to judge a phone because of its these kinds of limitation but the loss of a ""star"" is because of the lack of support from the company when I asked it some simple questions (such as does this work for T-Mobile and does 4G/LTE/3G work)...but over all it is an awesome phone and I do not regret my decision buying this phone!",22,4
Nokia,"So far it's a decent phone. I've owned similar Nokia phones for several years now and they have always been very reliable. For ~$26, I don't want to be overly critical but I do wish the call quality were better. I read a lot of rave reviews prior to purchasing and almost all of the reviews mentioned great call quality but that has not been my experience. My previous phone was a Nokia Xpress Music (old school!) and the call quality on that phone was always good so I don't think it's me.It came with a headphone set. My ears tend to be on the larger size and I still found the ear buds to be too large.Pros:Inexpensive!Decent battery life (several days even after making multiple calls)You won't ever be caught ignoring your kids staring at a smart phone all day!Cons:Fair to mediocre call qualityNo Bluetooth capabilityEar buds are largeIf you have never owned a Nokia, be sure to read the instruction manual. I was used to having buttons on the side of the phone to adjust the volume. It took me a while to figure out the volume is adjusted only while in-call by using the left and right joystick button.",10,4
Nokia,"This phone is incompatible with MMS messaging, which your friends with smartphones may use from time to time. It only uses the standard SMS technology, so I received many texts which the phone told me could not be displayed, and it took me a few weeks to figure out that I had missed some crucial messages. Not the phone's fault, of course; I just didn't do my research well enough.If you are mainly going to be making phone calls, this phone is GREAT. It's light and small, buttons feel good, battery life is long, and the phone is solid as a rock like Nokia always is. I love Nokia, and this one feels like a warhorse, just like the Nokia 6030 that I bought eight years ago that this 106 replaced. If texting is critical for you like it is for me, then this is not the phone for you. I just ordered the Nokia 111 to replace this one- it can handle SMS and MMS messages.",53,5

Nokia,"So far this phone is everything I expected; its easy to use, has a decent processor, stable software, good camera and lots of apps to download.But it has some limitations I was simply not expecting to see in a new Nokia phone:- The camera despite having a decent quality is has none of the basic options other simpler phones provide, it lacks filters, color modes, and even brigthness adjusment.- The battery life can be kind of short, I don't make many calls but I do browse the web a lot and this can consume the battery in just 2 days specially if you are using 3G.- The internet browser doesn't display most pages in the most ordely way one would expect and you have very little control over the zoom so you either see the pages from too far or you see them way to close, so much that the text sometimes gets compressed in a very thin column- It doesn't display menu options in spanish, despite being international and having, italian, french and portuguese language packages installed.Another problem I had was that the signal reception is kind of weak, but this One is mostly caused by my current carrier (MOVILNET) here in Venezuela. Aparently some carriers here are not very friendly with unlocked phones some apps that require internet accses like ""Whatsapp"" are not supported or barely suported, I had to change the data packet acces point manually to use internet and still I have a lot of limitations and I will probaly have to move to a more stable but expensive carrier like Digitel or Movistar.ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU CAN CONFIGURE ANY UNLOCKED PHONE YOU ARE GONNA BUY TO USE IT AT ITS FULLEST IN YOUR COUNTRY, READ LOTS OF REVIEWS, AND CONSULT FORUMS, YOU CAN'T JUST PUT A NEW SIM CARD EXPECT EVERYTHING TO WORK FINE SOMETIMES IS NOT THAT SIMPLE.",10,4
Nokia,"Many people have commented on the good quality of the sound of this phone. (which was the main reason I purchased it)Its size and keypad design are good for normal use. ( I have large hands and find it not difficult) I find myself searching for the 0 though, but I still like the design.The overall feel and design of the phone are very impressive. It doesnt look cheap.The camera is better than I expected (I wasnt expecting much).The touch screen is ok. It is a little tough to get used to. Initially I turned off the haptic feedback vibration in hopes to preserve battery, but I found that it helps with navigating the touch screen. Though the proximity sensor doesn't always work when making a call, so my ear will set off the screen and get a vibration sometimes.Battery life is pretty good (I charge maybe once a week with moderate use).I use this phone as pay-per-use, and for that I would say it is excellent.If you are expecting this to be a smartphone, you will be thoroughly disappointed.However, if you want a relatively cheap high quality unlocked phone to use as a 'phone', I would highly recommend this.",21,4
Nokia,"I love the candy bar phones. I want something simple and durable in a phone and I thought this would be an upgrade from my last phone. I purchased a 16gb memory card to compliment it for music mostly. I don't have a data plan so texting and calling were my main necessities. After about 50 texts I have to delete them because there is no room to receive more...and that's with 15gb free on the memory card. Messages cannot be saved to memory card so you are stuck with saving to the small phone memory. Also, even though I have contacts in there, many of them just don't show up in my address book. It's extremely odd, because there is no rhyme or reason to whose information will show and whose won't. The people's numbers who have ""disappeared"" are still somewhere in the phone's memory because when they call or text me, their name will show up, but I just cannot access the information if I need their phone number. I like the music player and the FM radio, it comes with a flashlight which is cool. I have yet to set up the VPN to receive MMS and such, but I'm not sure I'm going to yet because it is pretty ridiculous that these basic functions of saving contacts and SMS messages is as sub par as it is. If I am missing something, please let me know, but I see no way of being able to save your contacts or messages to an insertable memory card, and you are stuck then with the crappy memory of the phone",11,2

Nokia,"An awesome unlocked cell phone. I couldn't receive/send any images through at&t gophone service. I took it into a retailer and they were able to fix it so I could send photos, the only problem is that it can't download large photo images from smartphones (and that's what everyone sends photos with these days)BATTERY IS AMAZING. I can go a week or more without charging.I got a 32 GB memory card and I can play so much music from this phone, it's great.It calls/texts/plays music and that's all I need a phone to do.This phone is super great. Definitely recommend.",18,5
Nokia,"I wanted a light-weight phone with a FM radio. This Nokia has good reception w/ T-mobile, and the volume is good. The best feature is the FM radio. The antenna provided by Nokia is weak, so I recommend using an alternate - any 2.5mm headset will work fine. Just for comparison, I spent $300 on my previous phone, a light-weight Samsung phone w/ FM radio. I was disappointed with the Samsung - the phone itself was fine, but it used proprietary adaptors limiting my headset options. I bought 3 Samsung headsets, and all produced too much static for the FM radio to be useful.",18,5
Nokia,I got this phone for my mother. It's suitable for her because of the big keys and numbers. It's easy to use. It has a lot of features but she isn't really that technology savvy so answering and making calls is all that she needs it for. I've always liked products by Nokia.,12,5
Nokia,"If you want a simple flip phone without the bells and whistles of the more common phones that have internet, ect. than this if for you. It has great simple features. It has an extra loud ringer setting and an option for a simultanious ringer/vibration setting which I like best. On other flip phones, it's either or. Great price too. I love this phone.",15,5
Nokia,"I got this phone as a replacement phone for my father. He had been using a Motorola V195, but it suddenly stopped working after many years of faithful service. I was looking for a simple, easy to use phone similar to the V195, because he's not tech savvy, and for him, the simpler, the better. The Nokia 2720 S40 Flip fit the bill. An added bonus is that the call quality is much clearer on the 2720. It's a straightforward flip phone, with some nice features. In fact, after setting up his phone, I liked it so much, I bought one for myself, to replace a Samsung flip phone. But the 2720 I bought for myself came from WalMart, for $31/shipped site-to-store. The phones are similar, but not identical. I'll do my best to explain the differences below:To begin with, the Amazon 2720, even though it says ""US Version with Full Warranty"", does NOT come with a full US warranty from Nokia. The good folks at UnlockedCellPhoneKings, who filled the Amazon order, explained to me that ALL UNLOCKED CELL PHONES void the manufacturer's warranty! They also stated that Amazon writes the headings for the ad and they have no control over what Amazon writes. In terms of the warranty that does come with the Amazon 2720 -- THEY (UnlockedCellPhoneKings) provide their OWN warranty (in this case, a 1 year warranty). And while that's better than nothing, it is not the true full US warranty that comes with the WalMart pre-paid Nokia 2720. Furthermore, the WalMart prepaid 2720 comes in a sealed package, with the actual manual that's specific to the 2720. The 2720 that I got from UCPK's came was in a generic box with a generic manual. I called UCPK's to ask why, and they explained that they buy in bulk, then put together packages after they get an order. They claimed that the phones are brand new, but there's really no way of knowing that. I would suggest that if you buy one of these phones from Amazon, rather than from WalMart, you buy it from UnlockedCellPhoneKings -- they were a pleasure to deal with, and they have a toll free number.As far as the phone itself, I prefer the one from Amazon. It has certain options (i.e. it allows you to re-configure BOTH soft key pads, rather than just the left soft key pad), and the home page (the page you see when you first open the phone) has the time in a much bigger font than the WalMart 2720. But that's basically aesthetics, and each person's preferences are going to be different. In terms of actually using the phone, they're both easy to set up and easy to use. (I had read that some people felt the volume was too low when using the speakerphone. I think the reason is that the speakerphone does not use the same volume setting as the normal mode. You have to press the up volume button while you're on the speakerphone in order to increase the volume to a more audible level.) The only real drawback I found is that these phones are fingerprint magnets. I would suggest getting some inexpensive face plate covers (front and back), since they faceplates not only provide protection to the phone, but also they cut down considerably on the fingerprints.In terms of a simple, easy to use flip phone, the 2720 does a good job, and these types of basic phones are becoming harder and harder to find. And while I like some of the features of the Amazon 2720 better than the WalMart 2720, for the price, I'd go with the WalMart 2720 for $31/shipped to the store. The one inconvenience, as another reviewer pointed out, is the fact that there's no USB outlet or removable memory card on the 2720, so even though it takes photos, there's no simple, direct way to GET the photos from the phone to your computer. There are two possible options. 1 is to get a USB Bluetooth dongle to plug into your computer. You then pair the phone with the computer (but not as a modem) and you can transfer files from the phone to the computer, or vise versa, IF you have the right software. (Nokia has 2 free software suites -- Nokia PC Suite (which is older), and Nokia OVI Suite. Even though PC Suite is older, a lot of users seem to prefer it to the newer OVI Suite. Both are available for free download on the Nokia site.)Another option is to get a USB SIM card reader. They work like memory card readers, and range in price from around $8 to $30. I read some reviews and the cheaper ones don't seem to work all that well. The one that seemed to get the highest reviews was the: Dekart SIM Card Reader + SIM Manager 2 software. Here's the Amazon link: http://www.amazon.com/Dekart-Card-Reader-Manager-software/dp/B0045BIUGG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1296592924&sr=8-5. It can also be purchased directly from the Dekart site: [...](Personally, I find the shipping costs to be ridiculous from both places, but I was unable to find this item from any other source other than Amazon or Dekart directly.)(NOTE: I have T-Mobile, and the SIM cards from the old phones worked perfectly in both the Amazon 2720 and the WalMart 2720. I simply inserted the old SIM cards, synced them with the built-in phone address book memory, and was on my way. The folks at UCPK's explained that the 2720's that they sell are designed to work fully with T-Mobile. They will still work with AT&T, but not all of the options will be fully operational. The ones from Walmart appear to be locked into T-Mobile, but I'm not 100% sure about that.)",44,4

Nokia,"I just returned from a trip to Asia, visiting 2 countries. I did research to ensure this phone is supposed to have the bandwidth to support the wireless spectrums used by those 2 countries. Since the phone was already unlocked, I simply purchased a SIM local to the country, pop the SIM in, and activated the SIM/phone #. Wholla! Works like a charm. Called local to the country and back to USA. Sound quality is crystal clear. A friend could not even tell I was almost half way around the world when we chatted.The back case is a bit tough to open initially. The back cover will only slide downwards for a few millimeters, where then you can lift the cover to access the battery and the SIM slot. After the first couple of times, the stickiness wears off.You can then go to the Nokia website to download their Ovi Suite software, where you can transfer data between your phone and computer via USB cable.It would have been nice (would have been willing to pay a little more) for the vendor to have included the USB data/charger cable with the phone. I had to locate and purchase it separately on a different website.The one weakness of the phone is that there is no quick way to change volume without taking the phone away from the ear.",30,5
Nokia,"Pros:* The phone has a clean and simple design. The navigation menu isn't cluttered like most other phones these days.* The call quality is decent, and the screen is bright.* Bluetooth works as it should.CONS... Here we go...* The battery life is sub-par. An hour-long call is enough to bring the battery life down to half-charge. One of the methods the manual offers to conserve battery life is to lower the brightness of the display. The thing is, YOU CAN'T. There is NO OPTION ANYWHERE in the display menu or any other area to control the brightness of the screen (and it is bright).* There is no way to control the size and layout of the time and date on the main screen. This is especially annoying when you want to gaze at the lovely wallpaper you install. The only way around this is to hide the clock and the date completely.* The phone does not come with its own USB to connect to the PC. This is important, because you (supposedly) NEED to update the software on this phone when you get it or you will run into problems like being unable to receive and send multimedia text messages. The Nokia website states that you can update directly from the phone itself but only with some models. Apparently, they decided not to have that convenience with the 2730, so the only way to update is through a PC connection. Of course, you can't use just any usb connector. I have no idea what this particular inlet model is called but I took a picture of it and will post it in the product photos.I currently am unable to send or receive multimedia messages and had to work it out with AT&T for quite a while to come up with a solution, which we didn't. The multimedia messages menu won't even allow me to mess around with the Configuration Settings to configure my service provider. My only option is to install the update and hope for the best but, of course, it didn't come with the USB.If it weren't for these issues, I would have given it four stars.",12,3
Nokia,"I'm using this on AT&T around Dallas, Texas. I've been switching between GSM and 3G because one gives me more bars in certain situations. It's replacing my Nokia Lumia 520 which I have used for a few months now, but am starting to get tired of all the carriers fighting about smartphone plans and wanted to get myself out of that mess by ditching mine and going on the GoPhone feature phone plans.And I really don't regret it.The phone itself is made out of this really nice and smooth premium plastic. It feels great in the hand. The keypad lights up and is very easy to use. The directional-pad is pretty good too. I really like that the MicroSD slot is on the side and not in the back like the 520. The charging port bugs me that it's on the top, but at least I can reuse my old one and have a backup.I haven't tried the camera yet, but the software has so many point-and-shoot like features. You can also actually shoot video much easier than the 520 (I still haven't found out how to without an extra app, heh).The Series 40 operating system is great. Really, really nice and robust for dumb phone software. The built-in productivity apps aren't all that fancy, but are very valuable once you start inputting the data. The best thing that you can push things to the SD card for easy exporting. You can easily add your own .jar apps by sending it to the phone via Bluetooth. It worked instantly with my Late 2011 MacBook Pro. Sonic Advance and Block Breaker 3 are two games I've tried with it so far and they play nicely. Albite Reader works great for ePubs too, not that I plan on reading much on here, but it's good for some offline longform.I was also able to print to my Polaroid PoGo printer with it.Plugging in some headphones also gives you access to local radio. Unlike the 520, it lets you pull up the RDS, but it doesn't sound as good, even in stereo. It lets you record though.Call quality itself is very good too. I've only called AT&T this far in, but it sounded good!Overall I'm pretty happy with it. I have a new 64GB iPod Touch I'm going to use alongside it, so I'm not going to miss too much.",10,5
Nokia,"The phone is of high quality and connected fine in 2G mode, but would not connect in 3G mode with my AT&T cellular service in Maryland, USA. The reason became apparent when I discovered that the 301.1 version was sent with a non-mfg label over mfg label stating it was 301.2. The manufacturer label (and label under battery cover - see photos) showed clearly that this was the 301.1 version, which has 900/2100 WCDMA and will not allow 3G on AT&T in the USA. I returned it less then 2 hours after opening it since the sole reason I purchased the phone was because AT&T is dropping 2G service in my area by the end of 2016, and it seems they have already been decommissioning 2G on some towers as my coverage has gotten worse on my 2G-only cell phone. Both sellers using Amazon fulfillment appear to be shipping the 301.1 version instead of the 301.2 version described on the product page - this is evidenced by the user reviews. Buyer beware - this phone will not provide 3G service in the USA!",10,3
Nokia,"This is a GREAT phone for the many, many of us that want a PHONE, not an overpriced piece of techno glitter with a bazillion features we neither want nor use. Why U.S. cellular providers do not offer this or similar phones is a mystery to me.It's classic Nokia - solid build, clear and logical user interface, real keyboard, good size clear display, camera that's fine for the occasional quick photo and it's affordable. As to the power consumption issue that has appeared in some European reviews, I just don't see it - I fully charged the phone over 2 days ago, have left it on - with Bluetooth enabled - and made several calls and the battery shows 75% full. Works for me !",28,5
Nokia,"An avid smartphone user for 6 years now, I bought this 301 this week to augment my Berry for those weekends and other times when I don't need the full pocket computer rolling. Battery life has been solid so far. Need to still do a full run-down test, yet the four bars keep staying on for a nice, long time. This review is a first impression.Don't let the 1990's look fool you, it's packing 3.5G (T-Mobile 4G for me) underneath this fully global, quad-band factory unlocked package. For not much more than a dual-band, I upgraded to the quad-band for some planned travel this coming year, and this should do the job quickly and happily. While it's nice to be ""unplugged"" from back home, it's a solid setup to be able to tie into web browsing and the email apps for Google, Yahoo, and Exchange built in. This won't replace your typical 4-6"" touch screen device for video consumption, however it loaded up my 32GB SD card that I use in my other device and played audio tracks within two minutes.I don't see this replacing my smartphone needs with work and such, however it has been a joy as a number two phone, ideal for those nights out when you are expecting a phone call/text and may want to hop on the web while waiting in line or whatnot. Bust out this 301 and pop onto the Xpress Browser or email your friend on their big screen pocket computer/phone and be prepared to see some shocked faces. This thing cooks. I wish that it would be sold in stores, however I'm a happy Amazon customer and this device seems to hit a nice medium between ""dumb phone"" and ""smart phone"" with sharp, near landline call quality and quick T9 typing.With the ability to quickly swap out the SIM from my Berry to this 301, I've got a fun and useful duo for the same price as compared to upgrading to popular 32 GB models of other smartphones, while using the latest iterations of some longtime players in this still, relatively new field.In sum, I'm impressed. I haven't had a Nokia since before my work BlackBerry days, yet I can tell you this, this is a great second SIM phone for those of us tethered to those devices and a solid telecommunication device, complete with up to date wireless tech baked in. If you're looking for a phone that does the talking thing with a clear voice, look no further.",25,5
Nokia,#N/A,13,4
Nokia,"I just use this as an awesome pay-as-you-go ""Voice Phone"" to supplement my work-supplied smartphone with unlimited voice/internet. I just wanted something small and easy to slip in my pocket, because my old E51 can only hold about an hour charge after 5+ years. For voice calls, it's great. And the ringer gets CRAZY Loud. I do miss ability to connect via wi-fi (because I've never tried any of the internet features)... but I'm too cheap to burn my pay-as-you-go minutes for internet. With internet/Bluetooth disabled, and only voice/text enabled the phone seems to hold a charge for about 24 days... and I've talked as long as 11 hours on it before the bar got down to 1/3 to 1/4th power. My phone generally just sits in a low-power sleep mode awaiting calls, so that might explain my highend battery life. It beats the pants off of the ""Disposable"" TracPhones... and my HTC Sensation/Blackberry/Samsug Galaxy S for voice calls and ring volume. I can hear it from the other side of the house (Though I did set the electronic screeching of Skrillex ""Boomerang"" as my ring tone so it would be extremely audible!) Decent MP3 Player too. Camera is small in MegaPixel but the seamless Panoramic Patch-View mode that stitches together pictures by connecting invisible ""floating boxes"" works really well. Wish my high-end Digital Cameras did that! I should also mention that I dropped my contracts with T-Mobile, and switched to pay-as-you-go. I was really hesitant to do this, but on paper it saved $1000/year for my wife and I. Now, we load about 1000 minutes every 6 months @ 100 dollars for 10 cents a minute and a 1 year expiration. Since these are our ""backup phones"" for inbound calls and we my work phone with unlimited minutes... this works perfectly. I couldn't ask for a better Voice Phone with a simple keypad, Camera and MP3 player. I picked this over the E52 largely because this is a new phone, and that is technology from 3 years ago which I'd have to buy from the Gray Market overseas. I didn't figured that battery life on any new ""Prior Generation Phones"" (like the E51 or E52) would be dubious at best -- since and the battery would have been resting in a ""New Unopened"" box for so many years in a discharged state. I'm on the Internet enough at work... and I have my Work Phone for that. As a great Voice/Text phone, the sound, volume and quality is perfect.",16,5
Nokia,"I'm going to try to post the same review for two different Nokia ""feature"" phones, both of which I've bought through Amazon. First some context: I'm a geezer who likes dumb phones. I want a phone that will allow me to make and receive voice calls, and send and receive occasional text messages. That's it. No social networking, no automatic touch-and-pay capability, no spoken driving directions, etc. My previous phone, which I owned for about 8 years, was a Nokia 6030. Great phone!Recent phone calls and mailings from carrier AT&T warned me that my ""phone will no longer be supported"" after 11/30/14 in my service area in NorCal. I have a little technical background, but am not a phone geek. Had to do a bit of research on phone bandwidths, frequencies, and ""generations"". I wanted to understand why my old phone had finally reached end-of-life, and to pick a replacement that would provide similar capabilities and a long-as-possible future life. Hopefully this research will be helpful to others who face the same situation down the road.My old 6030 was a ""GSM-only"" phone. I had found on trips to Europe that it's also a U.S.-only phone. GSM is sometimes referred to as ""2G"", and it's this 2G function that AT&T is in the process of dismantling across the U.S., ending with final shutdown by 12/16. So I was looking for a 3G or better replacement phone.Both 2G and 3G generations of phones use different wireless frequencies in the U.S. (and Latin America) vs. the rest of the world (ROW). U.S. 3G runs 850 & 1900 MHz, with the lower ""more flexible"" frequency working better on insides of buildings. ROW 3G runs 900 & 2100 MHz.I initially chose the Nokia C2-01.5 for its small size (2-in. display), closest to my old 6030, and fitting nicely in my existing horizontal belt holster. However, early on I found the 3G reception indoors at home marginal, never actually dropping calls, but making normal conversations difficult, with audio gaps at both ends. Although the phone is represented as ""U.S. Version"", the phone's specific ""type"" is RM-721 (900/1900/2100), which omits the important U.S. inside-building frequency of 850 MHz. A better flavor of this phone for the U.S. would be type RM-722, supporting 850/1900/2100 MHz frequencies, but I was not able to find this type for sale anywhere.Searched again on the Internet and through Amazon, and found the Nokia 301.2. While it's a bit larger (2.4 in. display), and a tight fit in my old Krusell holster, the item's Amazon title shows support for both U.S. 3G frequencies (850/1900; type RM-841). Very similar features to the C2-01.5, with its simple but battle-tested Symbian-derived S40 operating system. And it's newer, with first ship in April 2013, so should theoretically have a longer service life. The phone works great indoors and outdoors in my area, but the RM-841 type will have no 3G support in Europe.So my final solution is to keep both phones. The 301.2 will be my standard U.S. phone, and the C2-01.5 will substitute on any occasional retiree trips to Europe or the Far East. Both phones have solid Nokia build quality, and are really best-of-breed for this type of simple ""candy bar"" phone. Both are unlocked, and worked immediately when I dropped my existing 3G-capable AT&T SIM into them. And both support quad-band GSM (850/900/1800/1900), so should work on these older 2G frequencies worldwide for as long as they continue to be supported.",27,5
Nokia,"I purchased this phone to replace someone else's ""free"" flip phone given by AT&T (which started to have random glitches after irreversible firmware update). That person does not want or need any smartphone functionality, and for this purpose, this phone is a perfect replacement. It is very compact, it works on all non-3G GSM bands (doesn't seem to be working with AT&T's 3G frequency, but that is not important for a phone like this), it has a good reception in all zones covered by AT&T and a pretty good battery life.The body has a minimal set of buttons - no silly PTT (push-to-talk) or media player dedicated buttons on outside (which tend to be pressed randomly on other models and thus require the usage of key lock function, which is annoying), just a volume up/down button on the right side. The front display is minimalistic, but it does its function perfectly and displays all the needed info (current time or Caller ID info) using a perfectly legible and elegant-looking font. There are 2 charger ""ports"" on outside, one is USB (the ""micro USB"" kind) and the one is the round plug which requires the (included) proprietary charger. The phone can be charged through either of them and they are not covered by rubber ""flaps"", which is less ""annoying"" than other phones where you have to almost break your nails trying to extract the little rubber/plastic flap out of charging port.The software is also minimalistic but pretty functional, with all functions required by such phone working perfectly and easy to set up (you have to do a little bit of typing setting up MMS/WEB gateway settings for AT&T network (visit AT&T's official forums, the Nokia section, to read about necessary settings), but if you don't need these functions everything else is pretty self-explanatory and don't require any ""user manual"" or Google searches to set up). The GPS function works with AT&T's ""Family Map"" tracking service, though you do need to enable data usage for GPS function to be able to locate this phone's user with more precision and with shorter time, but the data usage is very insignificant and you don't have to do that if you don't use the ""Family Map"" service.What else... The built-in camera works well for its intended function - obviously not as good as similar cameras on smartphones but better than majority of cameras on other non-smartphones. Oh, and some people complained about the back cover being somewhat difficult to remove - it's true, it is initially difficult to remove it, but you can learn (after a few tries) to remove it easily, it just requires finding a right ""spot"" to press while pulling the cover, and the cover itself is made out of pretty flexible plastic so it is highly unlikely that you might break it (unless you are a very, very impatient person) and you don't need to remove it at all if you don't need to change your SIM card. Overall it is one of the best non-smartphone models I have ever had pleasure dealing with and I highly recommend it if all you need is to make calls and maybe occasionally send/receive a SMS/MMS message.",12,5
Nokia,"This is a wonderfully designed phone for people who don't have a data plan and don't want one. It gets great reception, makes clear calls and will do texting if you so desire. The main menu is super user friendly and it has some useful built in apps. The GPS Maps and navigation are free and you don't have to access the wireless internet to use them. You can download them with your home computer over your home internet connection and transfer them to the phone with the Nokia Ovi software suite. The FM radio and MP3 player work well. This little unlocked phone is far better than anything AT&T is currently offering for people who are not interested in accessing the internet with their cell phones. The freedom from AT&T's locked phone software is a huge plus and greatly simplifies the phones menu navigation and ease of use. I put in the AT&T SIM, 4 GB of extra memory and the battery and the phone fired right up. Only minimal configuration was required to meet my particular desire to have the GPS function never access the internet and to run the network in GSM only mode to save battery life since I never access the 3G network. If you are not technically inclined you need not do anything and you will be no worse off than AT&T's locked phone default configuration. The setup menus are very user friendly. I had no problem removing the back cover as some other comments suggested. The camera is nothing special and lacks auto focus but does have a flash. It is about equivalent in picture quality to a throw away snap shot camera. I highly recommend this phone to any non data cell phone user.",20,5

Nokia,"I have to say that this phone is an excellent value in every aspect. It has any feature you could want except wifi but this phone is NOT considered a smartphone by AT&T so you DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE $30 DATA PLAN FEE and you can use the $10 per month unlimited data!! I bought this phone for my husband because it seemed like the best alternative to an iPhone and similar touchscreen smartphones without the issue of having to pay the ridiculous ""Smartphone Plan"" fee. The camera works great even though it has no flash. You just set it to night mode and can get a better picture in low light settings. The internal data is plenty generous and you can also add an SD card for more memory. My husband particularly likes this because it means he can use it just like an iPod or any other MP3 player and it also has the built in radio so he can listen to it while at work (he is a residential/commercial remodeler) if he doesn't want to listen to his stored music. You can still answer calls right from the earbuds while using the radio feature. The touch screen is great, the screen size is great. It has fast response time from input or touch. We have absolutely no complaints at all.Some people might not like the idea of not having wifi, but if you think about it, if you buy any similar phone you're going to have to pay the stupid $30 extra monthly fee even if you do not use AT&T internet. With this phone you can just get the $10 unlimited data plan and be done with it. The internet works great on this phone and is fast in our experience.

It doesn't look as cool as the newer DROID or iPhone GUI, however look at the price compared to them, and you don't have to sell your soul to AT&T or T-Mo. Battery is OK.

Nokia,"OK..to start, I gotta say that the FREE shipping from Amazon SUCKS. So, if you want good shipping, dont use the FREE shipping that Amazon offers. Why? Tracking is horrible, tracking history is completely inaccurate.(I used the nokia N82 before)IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY THE CELLPHONE, READ THIS REVIEW. I THINK IT WILL HELP A LOT. IT IS LONG, I KNOW.Moving on, the cellphone is good for the price. Come on, where will you get a 300$ cellphone that has all the functions that this one has? It is insane: 3.2 camera, touchscreen, more customizable than iphone, external memory, etc etc.Regarding the touchscreen...I think it is personal taste.. I never used the iphone, and I think that this touchscreen it is VERY responsive. AFTER buying this phone and getting used to it, I used a friend's Itouch and I gotta say that my nokia 5800 is the winner. But as I said, it is personal taste. Still, it is a very responsible touchscreen (no matter you say that it is a resistive touchscreen)..like, you got no excuse..it is responsive, and it is responsive. PERIOD.Good things about it:-Starting to have more apps...you just gotta know where to find, for FREE.-MACRO of the camera is awesome.-I got the GPS with turn by turn voice direction (trial), and it is a dream. I wont know when they take away my trial...however, with voice direction, this thing it is a real GPS.-The media button is pretty useful.-It is legit that it unlocks when you take it close to your face when you are talking.-Speakers are also awesome. Super loud. Sound quality when you plug in earpieces are also really nice.-I love the cable to plug it in to the tv. I convert videos, put it on my cellphone and lay on my bed, plug the cellphone into the tv and voila. It is REALLY nice.-About apps. Right now I have 42 but I only use maybe 8 of them lol.-The screen it is mega-clear. It is one of the best screens ive seen.The ""so-so"" of this phone:-Build quality. It is pretty well built, however the screen it is TOO plasticky. When I put it under the sun, the reflection shows a big difference in the surface, I mean..it is not completely flat. Using the reflection of light you will realize it is not completely flat. In other words, the screen presents big flex (like in laptops, for instance). However, the rest of the cellphone is well built. If you take out the screen part of the cellphone, it is a pretty solid cellphone.-The camera. I dont know. Sometime it takes great pictures, sometimes it stinks. When there is too much suns, it doesnt work well. When there isnt light, it also sucks. It has to have the right amount of light.-For some people it may be ok, but this is a freaken fingerprint magnet. only the back cover it is mate. The rest of the cellphone devours fingerprint as a dinasour.-Battery life it is not the best, but not the worst.The bad:-The interface it is not the friendliest. It could be better. I hope that with the update, it will be user friendlier.-The screen. As I said, it is too flexible. It kills me to see differences with the reflection of the light (you know what im saying if you have the cellphone). It makes me hella nervous.-Sometimes the phone in landscape mode, when you want to scroll down or up for example in some setting, it is freaking hard. I always keep tapping the wrong thing. in vertical mode this doesnt happen, because the scroll bar it is sticked to the right of the screen, so you dont have margin of error. however, in landscape mode the scroll bar is in the middle of the screen, so it gets tricky.-Honestly, the phone it isnt the best looking phone in the market. It is just a chunk of plastic. (This is for people that care about appearances. I personally dont care, but im trying to be objective)Ok, I think this is pretty much it. If you read this, you may decide whether to buy ir or not. I think it is a pretty good phone for the price. If you are RICH and money it is not your main problem, I would say go buy yourself a N97. Oppositely, I would say definitely go for this cellphone; I like it pretty much. You wont regret it (however, remember all the things I wrote in this review). If you are ok with the cons of this cellphone, you wont regret. And in my opinion, the Pro's overcome the Con's so... I dont know, it is your call!I hope this helped.",264,5
Nokia,"i buy this phone bcos i want to use it as phone and i-pod like i-phone, i use t-mobile service which is far cheap than at&t's i-phone service..now i already use this phone for more than a month..first what i like about the phone1 it has 3.5mm audio jack where i can connect any speakers to use it as mp3 music player its at top like i pod.2 8gb memory card enough to hold your likable 100 songs,10-15 videos and 1 movie in it.like i have in it.3 sreen display quality is good.video quality is also real good4 wifi is good. and browser also good loads all kind of web pages.it dont play flash videos..big no no for me..5 gps also work great..its capable of giving your exact location when you are on road... i load whole Texas(us) maps on it and it takes 200 mb of my space..but if you have web connection on phone go with google maps application. nokia's ovi maps are far behind google. for usa ovi maps dont works great i dont know about eurore or asia..6 desktop shortcuts are good but we need more than 4.7 calender,clock aplications are good.8 camera flash is bright i load torch software on phone and i can use it as torch also.dont like abou the phone..1 cheap plastic body of phone.dont robost as nokia phones..shaking body.2 camera picture quality is too bad.. it is 3.2mp only to take space consuming pics.. clarity of pics is too bad and there little color difference in pics too..picture quality is little better when outside under sun.camera really disappoint you.3 not easy to access the lists like phonebook. you have to scroll by using side scroll bar. you dont scroll the list from contacts like in i phone. and there is no up-down buttons on phone.if you have long list of cantacts like 150 and you want to scroll from scrollbar.you are unable to stop on contact you want from scrollbar it run too fast.(long list same scrollbar).4 when you have to dial the number in between of call like-->slect 1 for english 2for spanish -->some time it dont take your input value..i remember lot of times teller machine told to ""hung up and try again"".bcos it dont get the input from me..5 no security for data.. anybody in your family or friend can access you photos,videos,masseges etc there is not even a simple pasword securiy on phone.. pin number only works when you restart the phone.6 screen unlock key is provided at the side of phone.which is sliding one i dont think this key lasts long time.because every time i have to use the ihave to use that key..even to look for time.. in i-phone u can unlock phone from screen itself and in samsung touch phones this key is push button key not the sliding key.7 no outside music controls like pause/play,next.you have to unlock the phone for pausing or selecting new song.8 data cable provided with phone is too small.i have to buy aconnector for it to increase the length.otherwise your phone is hanging on desktop.9 audio quality when you use the headphones is not impressive even my 20$ 2gb mp3 player has better sound quality.even with higest volume and full bass you dont feel your head shaking.its just your hearing songs on it.without quality sound.8 3.2 inch screen size..its big but its not like i-phone i-phone's 3.5 inch has square kind of size.but 5800 if too long lengthwise and too short with wise.many time i think of returning the phone.. but i dont find any other phone in market which fulfill my reqirements.. i dont want to carry ipod and phone(two gadgets).i dont want to pay 100$ a month for i-phone AT&T. and nokia 5800 for only $299.think its good deal.. this phone needs a lot small changes..",49,3
Nokia,"If that is Nokia's response to the iPhone, then Apple can rest for the next 2 years.I bought the phone because it is unlocked and I don't want to pay ATT data plan for two years. It also has Wi-Fi, Blue Tooth and GPS.What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap.What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call. And why does it have to ask me if I want to make a video call ?!? Like I do video calls from my land line.2/ So far I haven't found a way to do phone card call, without having to type in about 20 digits.3/ Could not manage to get the blue tooth conduit to run with my Vista Laptop. Vista asks for a driver, Nokia says that they have provided the driver.4/ Even the full size QWERTY is very difficult to use. You need to press much harder on the LCD so fat fingering is very common.5/ Help and support are pathetic6/ The battery died after about 8 hours, during which time I had made 3-4 calls. It virtually died it went from full charge to almost empty in a matter of 10 minutes.All in all, I am considering to return it and get a phone that actually works, without having to have manicure or three hands.============================================ 10 DAYS LATER UPDATE:-------------------------------Here we go:PROS:1/ The battery issue disappeared after about 1 week nightly recharging. Now the battery indicator has a tendency to be 100% all day long, and I do talk more than when I was testing the phone. I am not sure if the indicator is correct, but at least it has not let me down while I am talking.2/ The phone has relatively decent ""Voice Command"" feature. That resolved my issue with the number of clicks to make a simple phone call.3/ I received an SMS from NOKIA - telling me how to turn my GPS feature on. That was awfully nice of them - ~2 hours after the activation the GPS found me. Obviously there is a ""soak"" period. So don't expect immediate results. The ""soak"" period also falls in the CONS category.4/ I must admit that the ""Camera"" is fairly decent. Having said that - I did not buy the phone because of the camera. If you need a camera - ""you buy a camera"". I am looking more into the ""organizer"" functionality. (""I-DON'T-have-to-attach-my laptop-to-my-butt-but-it-helps-if-handy) kinda' application.CONS:1/ The voice command works fairly well. The problem is that NOKIA has prerecorded commands from, I am sure, some terrific Finnish guy, who has a terrible Finnish accent (as far as English is concerned). That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as ""Contacts"" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name.2/ The DTMF issue is a real problem. I do a lot of call card calls and conference calls. The phone has ""Copy --> Paste"" function, but this does not cut it. There MUST be a way to pre-program your call-in numbers, and log-in with 1-2 'clicks'.I do understand that ""One"" is not supposed to talk on the phone while driving, but this is ""One's"" decisions. By no means it is NOKIA's decision.3/ In order to access features there is a substantial time lapse between the moment the feature is activated ( you click) and the moment you can use the feature. I wonder why is that!?!WHO IS WATCHING?!? AND WHAT that ""WHO"" IS?The long ""soak"" frustrated me and invoked questions about the safe keeping of my privacyCONCLUSIONThis phone is an acquired taste ... or maybe Symbian is an acquired taste ... I don't know.It has potential, if NOKIA fixes the annoyances in the firmware - e.g. the voice command works fine, minus the Finnish accent. GPS works,AND people know how to make it work and what to expect. (SMS simply does not cut it).There is no way to convince me that this phone is user friendly. It simply is not. You can easily access the most basic features, but if you want to do something beyond basics - it is a nightmare.I am sorry, but I do not buy a ""cheap"" $340 phone, just to figure out how to make a phone call, or take a note, or make an appointment, or take a picture. I buy it to be able to do all of the above - EASY.And learning how to do that has to take place in ""reasonable"" time - say 1-2 hours. This is not the case. So far I have invested about 8 hours to figure out the some of the questions, that are most annoying. Probably it will take twice as much to figure the answers.How about an brand new idea! How about, a user guide that actually guides you?!? Or how about some useful webcasts, that would teach you how to use the phone features, without having to spend 7 days trying to figure them out !?! What a challenge !!!THE VERDICTI WILL KEEP the phone.I will keep it, simply because, based on my experience and judging by reviews about the competition, it is MORE acceptable.It is nowhere near to the iPhone, but that is another can of worms.I expect huge improvements from NOKIA on:1/ User interface2/ User manuals or instructions3/ Ease of use - functionality.All of the above can be fixed by software, so I am expecting the upgrades.Happy upgrading !!Enough said - 2-1/2 stars - FINAL !============++++++++++++++++++============LAST UPDATEThe headphones coming with the phone are AMAZING !!!Easily comparable to BOSE.I heard depth and breadth of music, that I hadn't experienced in a long time. (That is after I figured how to copy the music to the phone, and how to start it). Seriously - the sound from the headphones is exceptional !Maybe it is what it says ""XpressMusic"" - I will give to NOKIA that - Music is PERFECT !!! Much better than my wife's iPod !Still - 3 stars for the overall phone - MAX.Music on the headphones is excellent though!!The phone is an acquired taste ...",30,2

Nokia,"I had been looking for a new phone for a long time. Every phone in the AT&T store and at their online site just did not seem to be attractive. Sure, the iPhone is great, but I didn't want to commit to a 2 year contract with a required $30/month data plan attached. And I can't replace the battery myself? Can't use the phone as a wireless modem? Hmmmm, there must be a better option. Hey, what's this? An unlocked Nokia phone that doesn't require a monthly data plan and I'm not locked into a 2 year contract? I can use the phone as a modem and the battery is easily replaced? Too good to be true? Actually it just gets better from there. Don't want to incur data charges? Just go find a local wi-fi spot and you're online in a few seconds! Oh, its an incredible music/media player as well. The built in speakers are the best I have ever heard coming from mobile phone or any other small device. If I turn the volume all the way up I can rock my office when I am alone, otherwise I need to turn it down or plug in the headphones. Did I mention the GPS? Very nice feature for a phone, but it was a little slow giving directions during a trip to Seattle recently, still worked ok and helped me find my way around town. I signed up for the free trial and it was useful, but my Garmin does a better job, but the Garmin was more expensive than this phone and that is its primary function. Still a cool feature, but that's not what I bought it for. First and foremost I use this as a mobile phone! You know, talking to people the old fashioned way, by voice. And this phone does that function flawlessly as well as letting me access the internet either via hot spots or through AT&T's 3.5G network (must mean that they're half way to 4G), which blankets Southern California and worked well in Seattle too. The other features you'd expect are present as well, a decent 3.2 mg camera and video that are fun to use, 8gb of micro SD storage and easy USB connection to your computer for uploading your favorite tunes, which you can use for your ringtones. So if you want a great phone that does just about everything an iPhone does and a few things more, for less and without a 2 year contract and a required data plan, check out this Nokia, you won't be disappointed. In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit that I signed up for an unlimited data plan for $15/month that does not carry any commitment, I can drop it at any time, but I enjoy being able to look things up or access my email while away from my office that I have continued to use it. Also, don't be concerned that this is an unlocked phone, its too easy to set up if you have an existing phone you are replacing. Just slide out the sim chip in the old phone and slide it into the Nokia. Pop the battery in and you are good to go! Now go have fun!",13,5
Nokia,"hi, first lets setup my parameters. I am a Tmobile subscriber from Tampa Bay area. My reception is the highest available. I have owned in order a Ericson from the PCS days, a Panasonic from ATT/Cingular days, Nokia 6120, 6131, Tmobile Dash, Tmobile Shadow, Nokia N95 8GB (for 3 weeks but then the display went out and i got scared to want to replace it so i returned it. Please also note this is my second time owning a Nokia 5800. The first time was a European model with US warranty since i got it from the Nokia Flagship store in Chicago. That had the first firmware with no updates...and it sucked. Sucked so bad I sold it used because I couldnt wait for the firmware upgrade. So now we advance to today. And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone. The most current firmware 20.0.012 has made this Nok great. I know this because I have owned both. I take off .50 because no the UI is not as pretty as the Iphone, nothing is when it comes to touch. the other .25 is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface, it does slow it down. So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly. This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother. Their is no crazy ear piece problem. The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand. This cant be said of the Iphone. The Iphone is awsome yes, but its kinda big to use as a cellphone. ok let me real this in. The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen. As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back. Clearly the firmware upgrade tweaked the sensitivity and made it much more responsive. im all over the place with this review, im sorry. if only Nokia could do better marketin partnerships and get this to a local Best Buy so people can touch it and feel how great it is...that for me is one of it biggest selling points...",14,5
Nokia,"Ever since I have used smart phones, nokia and symbian s60 has been my favorites, my last two phones being the n95-3 and the e71. I was hoping to hold out until the n97 but decided to give the 5800 a try.The phone itself is built very solidly for a midrange phone, there's no worry about dropping it and having it break on you, the screen is also very nice, this may not be the slimmest phone out there but it feels very comfortable in your hand, and the resolution looks amazing. I have a minor concern with the battery cover, it seems like it was more of an afterthought in the design of the device, there is no buttons or latches to secure it, just a few tabs that u click it into...I hope this doesn't break on me quickly.....but I don't see a need to be removing the cover very often, as the memory card and SIM card are inserted through the side, meaning this phone can have its memory cards switched very easily.The user interface seems like a quick and dirty job, it is basically the s60 v3 operating system with some bigger icons to make selection by touch a little easier. Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion.Another major concern that hopefully will be alleviated soon is the lack of third party apps, I'm assuming this operating system is still an infant and over time developers will start adapting their existing apps to use on touch devices.Handwriting recognition is my favorite input methods, although the full screen QWERTY comes in a close second. The t9 keypad works great for one handed operations, and the mini QWERTY keyboard is a joke.I was disappointed to see that the US version does not ship with an extra stylus, NOR DOES IT HAVE A CARRYING CASE.",15,4
Nokia,"I must say I got this cell phone for my mother who's around her sixties and she hates advanced phones so she was looking for something simple. So I got on Amazon searching for her favorite phone color which is Pink and found this phone that was ATT and unlocked. Then I immediately showed her and she fell in love with it because it was something simple and basic she can use when she needs to keep in contact with all her family. When the phone arrived it was a very nice phone and something anyone can figure out. Over all I totally recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't like advanced touch screen phones or those smart phones, this phone is perfect for someone who just wants it for taking pictures and talking on the cell phone for constant communication.",14,5
Nokia,"This phone might have everything you need and one might get used to it after a while but it's definitly not very easy to use. For example, the simplest of things like checking your messages, checking who's called, changing ring tones, texting numbers, writing a text, etc. are burried under layers and layers of menu options.There is, however, a programable ""go to"" button on the homepage where you can file all the functions you want in one place so that may be what Nokia has in mind for users access.",11,3
Nokia,Great purchase and smooth transaction. Recommend purchase of this phone for the older generation that do not want a smartphone.,14,5
Nokia,"So good if was human I'd marry it muwhahaha. Okay but seriously I love this thing, I bought this to replace a ( Nokia C3 touch and Type ) which has unbelievably tiny keys This one however is for me the phone of my dreams it is very easy to use and for it's compact size is loaded with tons of functionsMeasurementsLength 7 inches.

Unlike a phone I had in the past with yellow backlighting that causes eye strain this has white light like a lamp making it easy to see.SIM cardTransfering my SIM card was a snap, so you know on this phone the SIM card slides into a slot with the little gold part facing up instead of down, and is located below where the battery goes. There is a seperate slot opposite the battery for a memory cardSoundExcellent very clear, no static or distortions. hearing people talking is easy, volume control is great and easy to adjust thanks to the volume up down key on the left side of the phone. Reception is very good, there are also a nice selection of ring tones to choose from. You can also turn on or off the key beeps which I love hearing beeps with each key pressed drives me nuts",16,5
Nokia,"I used my first Nokia 6250 for almost five years. My husband and I looked at the new iPhone but I could barely read the fine print on the small screen. I do not eMail, text, surf the internet or listen to music on a phone so do not want a data plan, just a simple phone that can hold my address book.My husband was in an ICU when the my first Nokia 6250 finally had to be replaced. I put the sim card into my husband's Blackberri and used it for a frustrating six weeks: The tiny keys were difficult for my arthritic fingers to use, it was not nearly as comfortable to hold as the Nokia, and I'd never use most of it's features. I finally gave up on it and found this phone on Amazon.I'm again happy to have a phone that meets my simple communication needs, is comfortable in my hand and easy to use. I then purchased a mini iPad with a data plan. It is SO much easier to read and use than the ""smart phones, and it easily slips into my purse. For me, this is the best of both worlds!",59,5
Nokia,"The Nokia 6350 itself is fine, but I needed an unlocked phone This phone from this supplier was not unlocked. I've purchased two other unlocked phones on Amazon and had have no problems using them on my network with my SIM card.I can't remember the exact wording of the message displayed, but I looked on the Internet and found the message meant the phone was still locked. I also found that unlock codes are offered online for about $20 with the disclaimer that the codes are not guaranteed to work. I decided to return the phone.",39,2
Nokia,"Had another brand with a touch screen that didn't work well. If you touched the phone, not even the screen, it would disconnect the incoming call. Couldn't carry it in my pocket. Slightest movement would make the phone do who knows what even with the touchscreen locked. Gave up on touchscreens after the manufacturer of that phone replace the original and still had the same problem. Had to discontinue my unlimited data plan because the carrier (AT&T) didn't care about the problem with the new phone. I had it over 30 days and that was enough for them . This is an unlocked world phone. That means I can use it with any carrier anywhere in the world. When my contract with AT&T (yes, they gave me the other phone for a penny when I signed a two year contract, phone doesn't provide what I paid for but the contract is still in effect), I can use this same phone when I switch carriers. The only thing I don't like on this phone is the inability to delete unused icons from the menu screen, or to put icon shortcuts on the screen that you do use. Have to open an icon (My Stuff) then scroll to a menu item (Tools) then scroll to Recent Calls to see who called you when you were unavailable. Would be nice to have that menu item as an icon on the main screen. RECEPTION IS GREAT. Have to emphasize that feature. I'm in a rural 3G area (4G coming soon, or so they say) and the other phone from AT&T had two, one or no bars of service. This phone has either four or five all the time. Never dropped a call like it did all the time with the Pantech Renue from AT&T.",35,4
Nokia,i am so bummed. i bought this phone after reading all the great reviews for my daughters first ever phone on her birthday. she opened it and was so excited. we are living in costa rica so i needed something unlocked. i tried to activate it and put a local chip in only to find out its locked and i need a password to use it. please don't sell a phone as unlocked if its locked.,27,1
Nokia,I like Nokia and chose this as a gift. It's locked to AT&T. I live in Trinidad so shipping back to Amazon was out of the question. Amazon issued me a partial refund. They try to keep the customer happy. I would not recommend this seller for unlocked phones. This rating does not judge the phone. I cannot rate it since it is locked and I have been unable to use it.,12,1
Nokia,There is nothing bad to say about this phone. The delivery arrived before it was due. The phone was in new condition just as it said in the ad.,13,5
Nokia,"it is hard to charge, It does not recognize the charger which is a generic travel charger not the original. it came only with this charger, no papers, no booklet no headphones. it is a defective refurbished phone. I am waiting for the sellers to answer my claim.",14,1
Nokia,"I had to replace my wife's cell phone but I was not interested in entering into a long term contract with our service carrier. Thus I decided to try an unlocked phone. I've had very good service from Nokia phones that don't have the latest bells and whistles but that provide solid performance as cellular phones. Initially I wasn't sure that the process would be seamless as described but it all worked fine. I received the phone from Amazon as promised and after a short while the old phone was disabled and the new phone was up and working. My wife prefers a simple cell phone and this new Nokia has been pleasing to her. The fact that the Nokia chargers are interchangeable with older models is also a plus, since an extra charger makes it more convenient when we misplace an existing one.",34,4
Nokia,"We bought one of these, through Amazon, with the intent of trying it out and possibly buying three more (for the family). All we want is a flip phone with good sound and visibility. We don't want ""data"", except for support for MS Outlook-based calendars and contacts. We don't want text.We like the phone enough to buy one more, but not three because of vision limitations of two of the buyers. I'm giving this phone three stars but also am noting that I have tried a number of phones and haven't found anything better - and haven't found anything equivalent to my old phone (a Moto E815 on Verizon).The flip phone market seems to be a fringe market at this point.Plusses:1. Good display. Readably bright display, including by the geriatric members of the family. Numbers being dialed are large.2. Decent signal reception, but it's not stellar. Could be the carrier (new carrier for us).3. Good voice quality, both ingoing and outgoing.4. Calendar sync over USB, and contact sync over USB, is fine. We haven't tried bluetooth. Software only seems to run on Windows, though. The file system can be made visible (e.g. for Linux) but it doesn't seem to work consistently and although the sync app runs on XP on VirtualBox because the USB interface doesn't seem to work properly with Linux, I can't make the phone visible.5. Reasonably standard charger interface. Appears to use the same charger as Samsung.6. Nice feature set, from our point of view. I particularly like the maps - an add-on I can actually make use of.Minuses:1. Keyboard unreadable to both geriatric members of the family (who need to replace other mass-market phones they *can* read). There isn't enough contrast, even when the keyboard is lit up. We'll search for something else for those family members.2. Even with Bluetooth shut off real battery life is about a week, with perhaps an hour on the phone. I would have liked more.3. Can't download free content from Nokia's Ovi web site without paging. We don't have, or want, paging service. There don't appear to be any provisions to download using the USB interface or their sync app. This wasn't a key issue for us, but might matter to some.4. Haven't found an acceptable case. Nokia doesn't sell one. Just want a 'standard' flip phone case that fits. Phone's just slightly too big for the ones I've found.",33,3
Nokia,"Here are the Pros and Cons of this phone:(TRUE RATING IS 4.75 STARS - Reason not 5 stars is VERY HARD TO GET MMS and INTERNET SETTINGS for this phone - took me on and off 8+ hours to get the proper settings (please read more details of the phone and settings below):PROS:1) SD Card Slot holds up to a 16 gig card.2) Media Player is easy to set-up with play-lists.3) My Motorola Blue-tooth headset works great with this phone for calling and for listening to music (I use Blue-tooth often and this phone does a superb job in Blue-tooth areas as it has Blue-tooth 2.1 and will easily let me listen to my music files (not radio) with Blue-tooth).4) Love the menus that can be customized as the GO TO MENU.5) FM Radio! Many phones do no come with FM radio, so this is a plus for me!6) Great Browser - Opera (however, I use the T-Zones T-Mobile browser).7) Large and clear 2.2"" screen8) Overall the phone is very user friendly (easy for me because I am a Nokia fan and have used many Nokia phones over the years).9) Battery life is SUPERB! For me, the battery last for 3-4 days on just one charge!CONS:1)In unlocked phones it is necessary to call the service provider for these 2 settings: 1) MMS (picture messaging) 2)Internet Browser settings (In my case the setting for T-Zones)Because the first 2 T-Mobile reps tried to send me the settings over my phone and they never arrived to my phone, I almost sent the phone back to Amazon, however I had determination to get this phone to work so again I called T-mobile one more time and they were able get the proper settings on this phone (this process took almost 4 total hours of my time, yet so worth it). Yes, the third time was the charm! Internet works great , however at the moment, the MMS is still not working, T-Mobile said to give this setting 2 hours and if if still does not work to call back, and yes I will call back to get this setting TWEAKED as I know it can be done. Yet so far it has taken almost 4 hours of my time and still no MMS configured correctly, so that means another 30 - 60 minutes at least...So let you give you some words of advice in buying an unlocked phone: When you buy an unlocked phone, yes you can place your sim card in and these features work: 1) Calling out and receiving calls 2) Text messages 3) Other features of the phone.These features DO NOT WORK UNTIL you call and get the settings from the service provider: MMS picture messaging and Internet Browser. If you have WiFi on a phone,yes then the Internet Browser will work without having to call the service provider. (In my case, there is no WiFi on this phone).UPDATE: October 7, 2010After lots of tweaking and searching and sheer determination, I finally have BOTH MMS and INTERNET working on this phone. This has been my biggest challenge yet! But so so worth it. I did an internet search called: what are the t-mobile mms settings for nokia 7020 and found a FORUM in T-Mobile that had the ports, settings for both Internet and MMS. Since the Internet setting was OK, I re-did the MMS settings and they worked, I sent myself a picture and a recording to this phone and all worked! Word of advice: It is not an easy task to get both MMS and INTERNET SETTINGS to this phone as the phone will not accept the settings over the phone from T-Mobile, they must be put in manually and this does take time and patience. However, I love the phone and am so glad that I did this.",13,5
Nokia,"Good basic phone, good battery life, the double tapping on the screen was cool at first, but it got old and annoying fast. Plus, double tapping sometime work and sometime doesn't work. I missed my old phone when it actually shows the time and missed calls without tapping it. Limited ring tones. Limited wallpapers. I just needed a basic phone. This phone served my purpose. The sound quality is loud and clear. Not too much bells and whistles. No pre-loaded games also. Recommended as a basic phone. Don't expect too much beside a phone.",18,5
Nokia,"i got this phone hoping the nokia brand would give me better reception in the office: it's mildly better than the last verizon phone i had. i was disappointed: compared to my last 3 nokia phones, the sound quality on this phone lacks.the keyboard is great: rarely hit the wrong key. the twist feature is awesome, auto-locks the phone when you close it, and displays your choice of screen saver, with option to unlock and view messages, ignore or silence (but not answer) incoming calls without opening the phone.also disappointing was the lack of memory allocation control. you have a limited amount of text memory, with no option to copy texts to micro-sd. music player and speaker were FABULOUS but speaker quit the first time i dropped the phone, with a hard case on. i've dropped other nokias tons of times (in water too) without a case and they remained undamaged.the software is ok at best, not very intuitive at all (symbian was very intuitive, even more than the iphone software, in my opinion). you definitely have to hunt through some menus to change options outside the norm (eg, ringtone, etc), and the graphical interface is klunky, especially when it comes to texting, which is a shame given how amazing the keyboard is.all in all, if i were a teenager and didn't require much from my phone, i would be very happy with this one: it's cute, small, unique, has avatars, adequate ring tones, great screen and keyboard, easy to text on.",40,3
Nokia,"Let me start off by first saying this: The operating system that Verizon put on this phone, it is not bad itself, but it is awful looking. Horrible GUI, and a somewhat lackluster degree of organization. I think my Shih Tzu might have been able to create something more tasteful (ah, but I jest, she is merely a dog).Now, for the actual review. This phone is solid. I have dropped it, easily, thirty or more times, and it has yet to break! I was afraid that the pivoting design might be very delicate, but, having owned this phone for nearly four whole months, and having dropped, thrown, and scratched it a whole lot, it is still running strong.The only downside to the hardware is that the back doesn't really seem too well thought out, which is unusual for a Nokia device.Overall, but it, love it, show it to your friends, your mom, and everyone who walks by and says ""IS THAT A PHONE?!?!?"", and than proceeds to grab your phone and oogle and drool over it. BAM!",25,5
Nokia,This seller is totally a cheater.

Nokia,"Hey, you get what you pay for. In this case a fully functional, feature-loaded, little phone. The interface is Nokia so I, being from the U.S., find it more than a little clumsy but my wife, who is Israeli and used to Nokia products, loves it. She travels internationally and this phone is unlocked so she can switch the SIM card with reckless abandon! And if it gets lost it's not as traumatizing as losing a high-end smart phone.",10,4
Nokia,"I picked this guy up after my beloved Samsung T-509 (it won't let me product link it) started to die after five years of trusty service. My last few phones had been Samsungs, but I didn't find one that was cheap enough for what I wanted.I just needed a simple phone I could use for my T-Mobile service. I don't web browse on my phone. I don't really use my phone that much to begin with actually, so while I had a normally billed plan, I was planning on switching to prepaid as I discovered it was $10/mo cheaper, and didn't lock me into a contract. My first ever cell phone(s) were Nokias, so I figured I'd go back to my roots and pick this one up.Long story short, it does exactly what I hoped it'd do. All I needed it for is calling and occasional texting. While I don't find the texting to be quite as intuitive as it was on my previous Samsung phones, in all fairness I have to concede that that might be due to the fact that I'd had Samsung phones for several years, and my first forays into texting were on them - they were all I ever knew.The only gripe I have with this phone, besides the aforementioned texting learning curve, is that there's just a tiny bit of lag time for it to execute a command. It's not terrible, but it is noticeable. Oh, and the camera isn't much. I daresay my old T-509 had a better camera, and it was five years old! But then again, I wanted a basic phone, that is what I paid for, and that his what I got.What I like about the phone:Battery life - I'm not sure if the claimed 10.6 hrs of talk time is accurate, but it is a solid batteryMicroSD - I can put pictures and music and whatnot on there, and use them as my background, or ring tones (free, simple, and unlimited possibilities), or play them through headphones (standard head phone jack!)Radio - A feature I'll probably never use, but is kinda cool. You HAVE to have the headphones plugged in for the radio to work as they are the antenna, but reception was surprisingly solid when I was testing it. However, you can't play songs from the radio on speakerphone for all to enjoy the way you can with songs off the MicroSD card.Small - Fits in my jacket pockets well, the keys autolock to avoid too many pocket dials.I had no trouble getting it to work with my T-Mobile service. I just popped in my SIM card and it worked. I did have to call T-Mobile tech support to have them help me with SMS messages, which weren't going through or coming in. They had to send me some text that wrote some settings to the phone's memory, but it was quick and painless. It also survived the conversion to prepay and is working just fine on that plan now. For $50 I'm fairly satisfied.",41,4
Nokia,"Great little basic Cellular Phone. Allows one to do embarassing things, like talking to another person. Sound quality is good, Loudspeaker on-board and a simple camera too. Dialing digits are big and there are many features available. If you prefer a Dumb Phone instead of a Smart Phone...........this is the one for you. =:)",22,4
Nokia,"I was looking for a phone to replace my Nokia 3100 which has been a diehard. After reading the first and only review i took a chance and could not be happier. What made it even better was my wife's excitement about the phone. She is not very exciteable. So it was a real plus when she told me that she really like the phone. I was just looking for a good basic reliable phone, and got many more features than expected. I knew that it had a music player, but the 5 mp camera was icing on the cake. If you're willing to spend more, I'm sure there are better phones. But thus far me and my wife are very satisfied!",14,5
Nokia,"This is a great little phone if you like the candy bar format (as I do). While it's great to have a camera, radio, mp3 player, qwerty keyboard nearby, to me the most important feature of phone is how is functions as a phone. This one is perfect for making and taking phone calls on. As silly as that may sound, I cannot say enough how much I abhor trying to hold an I-phone up to my ear for any length of time. It just doesn't feel right. This one has a great feel to it. Very sleek and discreet. Big clean display relative to overall size. Nice audio quality and still slips into your shirt pocket without you even knowing it's there. ATT has informed that I will have to get a different phone as they will be shutting down their 2G network in May. Hopefully this one still works.",14,5
Nokia,"The Amazon price was the best available at the time of my purchase. Combine that with free shipping and this is a really great deal for those who want a GSM phone that has a decent camera, is simple to use, and has a reasonably small form factor. I am using mine on the AT&T network currently. I was previously using a Sony Ericsson W518a, which had been giving me a multitude of problems. I wanted a simple, unlocked phone that would work with my voice and text plan, but I didn't want to go backwards in camera resolution or expandable memory capabilities. Additionally, I did not want to renew my contract with an upgrade from AT&T (Just in case I want to switch carriers in the near future). I don't have a data plan and pretty much only talk and text from my device. This phone does both very well. The reception and voice clarity are superior to that of my previous Sony Ericsson. The Nokia interface is not as aesthetically refined as the Sony Ericsson was, but it is simple and reliable. I will take functionality over beauty if I have to choose between the two. Some nice extras are the inclusion of a 3.5 mm audio jack and a micro USB port which can be used for charging and data transfers (I hate proprietary jacks!). The only problems I had were in configuring the MMS, Internet, and MEdia Net settings. Since this phone has never been sold by AT&T, they won't provide any technical support. However, once I found some instructions for the configuration, it was easy to get all features running smoothly. This was a great buy.

Nokia,"The Nokia C2-01 is a feature phone. It does not do the web well. The 3G on this phone is pretty slow on AT&T when compared to the iPhone, and the interface is not touch screen. If you want those things, you should buy the iPhone. It's a cool phone, and you can play sweet games about birds and tweet a picture of the panini you are eating for dinner on Twitter, no problem.After a week, I am in love with this phone. It takes good-enough pictures, does Gmail pretty well, has great bluetooth connectivity, and plays my music. I can tether my iPad and computer to its data connection (AT&T) at no extra cost. The data connection is not fast but it gives me the web anywhere when I want it and, more importantly, its limited connectivity/non-touchscreenness helps me forget the web when I'm with my family.As a former iPhone user, I used to make fun of people with feature phones. Now, it seems like I'm more aware of actual life when I'm out getting my pizza party on with the wife and kids. Instead of sitting face-down in some Facebook with stuff going on around me, my phone stays in my pocket and my attention stays on what's important.It's not the phone for everyone, but it helps me be a better dad.If you feel distracted by your technology, but still want to retain some connectivity (for work or even with other gadgets), this is not a bad choice. And it's cheap.",80,5
Nokia,"bought phone from amazon 5/23/11. i got the nokia because my old phone was motorzr2 v9 which has a major flaw. the razr will only charge a battery to 1/2 full, because of the phone software. my phone before the razr was the nokia 6130 and it had a great battery life, but was small for a flip phone. i didn't want a smart phone or a touch screen, i just wanted a phone for calls, texting and that has a decent camera. i also didn't want to be locked into a contract for another 2 years with AT&T.the C2-1 so far fits the bill. I can't judge the battery life until i have had the phone for a year or so but everything else is ok. the phone is smaller than i thought but i can live with that for now. camera takes good pictures, no flash, but you can edit photos so thats cool. for people who want simple but good, this is the phone.update 3/12/12- i had the phone for over 6 months. battery life is average, i do not surf the net or take many pictures and i still have to charge the phone every 3 days, compared to a week or more when i first got it. i definitely do not store messages or pictures because that just drains the battery faster. pictures are ok and its easy to hook up the phone to my computer and transfer the pictures i take because you don't need to buy or download a special program to do it. i would not buy this phone again, but would recommend it an older mom or dad or for a young teen (before they find out about social networking and smart phones).",10,4
Nokia,"I have recently downgraded from iPhone 4 to LG GU295 provided by AT&T. Since I am using iPad 3G I didn't want to pay double data charges to AT&T. LG provided by AT&T is good as a paper weight.

Nokia,"I bought the Nokia C2-01 after reading reviews and being an Old Sckool kind of guy when it comes to phones. I need a Phone to Talk and Text, I got a Laptop for the rest....I use T Mobile Prepaid. When I first set up the phone I had a Problem. I could Not send or recieve picture messages. The only way I could get internet was through the Browser. The other functions like OVI store, Nokia.mobi, Home, and Web Services would not work.""""So here is how these Problems can be FIXED"""", I went to T Mobile online, go to bottom of the page and click on Contact Us, a new page will come up, on the top left click on Get Support Online .Now when you do this you will need your T Mobile PIN number, NO problem if you forgot it, the Live Advisor will help you set up a new one. After all the confirmation of who you are, The Live Advisor will send you a message to the phone and with a code (1234), open the message enter the code and ""ALL is FIXED"", just to make sure the live advisor will tell you to take a photo and send it to yourself. Yea send it to your own phone number, I did not use my area code and it worked, I got my own picture message. After doing this my Nokia C2-01 worked 100% all issues with sending picture messages, and other functions were FIXED !Personnaly the only time I ""might"" use the Web Browser is to check my Lotto Numbers, if you do the Face Book thing this phone is not for you because the screen is to small.I also bought on Amazon the ""I Talk"" phone case it does the job and all opennings are perfect, there are some on ebay , But I have noticed all cases for the Nokia C2-01 mostly come from England (Royal Mail) could not find any here in the USA and there are some from China(ebay). The only thing I could find sold here in the USA are Screen Protectors, ""don't forget them"".Head Set (Headphones) I bought this Nokia C2-01 new from Amazon, for the few $$$$ more why buy a used one? Anyway the phone came with a Nokia Head Set (headphones), This phone only works well with is own brand the Nokia Head Set that came with it. I have several Head Sets and my favorite Skull Candy Head Set, but they do not work well, they sound awefull, must use the Nokia Head Set !""Volume Control"", are the other people that write these reviews about poor volume control ""For Real""......This Nokia C2-01 Earpiece has Excellent Volume and Excellent Volume Control settings. .....Heres what you do....go to Menu, go to Settings, go to Navigation Key and select a short cut for the Volume Control on the Navigation Key (up or down or left-right, you pick). This little phone can get loud and the Media Player there is a different volume control that works well for the Media Player.This Nokia C2-01 is small, light and sleek, never had a problem with number keys being small for my Man hands, Has USB and Memory Card slots on the side. Head Set and Charging Jack on the top. Camera works, 3.2 MP for 1536x2048, 2.0MP for 1200x1600, 1.2MP for 960x1280, 0.5MP for 600x800, 0.3MP for 480x640, and 0.1MP for 240x320 this is a phone not a 14.1 MP Sony Cybershot, OK....Signal is Excellent, I work in a Hospital and never lost signal anywhere in the building. There is a Lanyard Slot on the top left side but you have to open the back cover to string it up and use it (if your into using a lanyard). Battery life is Excellent, charge last a long time. Good choice of ringtones. comes with 4 games Sudoku, City Bloxx, Brain Champ. , and Block'd .Media player is Great for this small phone, I use a 8GB micro SD memory card , listen to music with headset or speaker, I got a usb cable and the phone sync'd up with NO problem with my hp laptop music , photos, etc..and charges This is a Nice Simple Little Phone that gets the Job done.",11,5

Nokia,"Nokia C2-01 Unlocked GSM cell phone (Quad-band and 3G)I was looking for an unlocked quad-band GSM cell phone for use while traveling abroad. The C2-01 is priced the same as some of Nokia's other smartphones that had a full keyboard (Blackberry style) but the C2-01 was the only one in-stock at the time. I wasn't expecting a whole lot after reading numerous reviews of other unlocked cellphones purchased via Amazon that yielded used/refurbished phones or phones that weren't unlocked.I was pleasantly surprised when the package arrived and my C2-01 was brand spanking new from the factory, complete with a NOKIA factory seal on the box. The battery was new, and the phone was in excellent condition. I was up and running within minutes, and fully charged the battery. I threw in a SIM card from another AT&T phone and it was immediately working, no PIN or unlock requests, nothing. It immediately recognized the AT&T SIM card and logged onto the network. I was unable to use the Internet or browse websites though, since I couldn't figure out how to change the access points properly. Even if I figured out how to access the internet, the C2-01 is ill-suited for browsing. The keypad is circa-2001 and the screen is circa-2001. It is very easy to use for phone calls and text messages (albeit slow due to the keypad design), and has MP3 audio capabilities.The micro-USB port allows you to charge the phone as well as access data. The AC adapter works in 120V AC and 240V AC outlets. A SIM card from China Unicom was inserted into the phone while in China, and it immediately recognized the carrier and changed the language to Chinese. The text and menu were in Chinese, this is great if you can read the language while traveling. But this is not so great when you can't read Chinese and just wanted a local prepaid SIM card to use while visiting! However, the simplicity and ease of use made the C2-01 truly worthwhile as a travel phone. The fact it can be used anywhere in the world (quad-band GSM and international 3G) makes it extremely versatile. The long battery life and simple interface for making/receiving phone calls are just icing on the cake!Overall: 4/5 stars. Antiquated keypad and tiny non-touch screen remind me of the late 1990s/early 2000s Nokia cellphones. The saving grace: long battery life, and automatic recognition of prepaid SIM cards makes for a perfect travel phone that can be used almost anywhere in the world.UPDATE: I figured out how to set it up for Internet access and as I suspected, the interface is ill-suited for web browsing let alone modern apps.",21,5
Nokia,"First, I love this phone;It was everything I wanted, without all the ""smartphone"" junk and expense I wouldn't use. I didn't want to get stuck in another 2 yr contract, and have to buy a data plan with AT&T, just because I had to have a new phone. I researced for weeks, with no cell phone, ended up buying a gophone, LG Encore (touchscreen horror story!) and using it for 2 weeks before I settled on this phone. So I didn't just jump into a new phone. This phone is great as far as sound, dialing, texting, if ALL you want is a simple phone; If that was all, I'd give it 5 stars, so if you want to get a good, plain phone, at this price, go for it. You can stop reading now. However, if you want a phone you can use to take and then send or ever receive multimedia messages, keep looking. The camera, although a 3.2 mp takes grainy, blurry pictures. My biggest issue with the phone is that I can't ever receive or send anything except text messages. Forget the cute Christmas pics I was supposed to have gotten from friends and relatives! I had the phone for about 3 weeks before deciding there must be a problem, since I had more than 1 person ask what I thought of the pics they had sent! This phone IS NOT UNLOCKED to receive multimedia (mms)messages. Believe me, I have tried! I have spent literally hours on the phone with AT&T tech people over the last 3 days, trying to see if it could be set to receive mms. Every tech rep was extremely helpful and made calls, searched the web, and did all they could to try and help. After the first 2 days of working to find the problem, we even decided to return the phone and get another one (Amazon advertises the phone as unlocked for mms as well as web access). I received the new phone yesterday, and after letting it fully charge, went through the whole ordeal of set-up again. Then spent another hour on the phone with a tech, same thing. This phone WILL NOT accept, or send, multimedia messages, and you CANNOT access the web (though it is supposed to be unlocked to do that and is advertised as such), IF you use AT&T services (I can't speak for other carriers), be aware this will not work for you. One last thought, since I'm sure many of us might assume it is AT&T's fault, since this is not their phone maybe they just don't want to put in the codes needed. I also had a conference call with Nokia. The rep I spoke to was very rude and refused to help or assume any responsibility from Nokia. I had called Nokia and been told to have the AT&T tech person do a conf call with me and they would be able to help. When I got a tech person on the phone and called Nokia back, their rep was unbelievably rude and a huge waste of time. Nokia refused to help at all. I now have to either keep a ""dumbed down"" phone, or go through the process of trying to find a good phone all over again! So, buyer be aware!",20,2
Nokia,"I am a college student who was in desperate need of a new cell phone after my old one stopped working. Because of that I wanted to buy a phone truly worth the money, and one that would last.For someone who isn't willing to pay for 3G service, but still wants internet, and a modern looking phone, THIS is the perfect cell phone. Phones like this are very hard to come by because most do require data packages (the ones considered smartphones anyway). I can't say how it compares to a smartphone having never owned one, but for someone like me it's perfect.- QWERTY keyboard is well spaced, text messaging capabilities are wonderful- WIFI! Can I stress how important this is? It's probably the best feature of the phone. Wi-Fi is pretty much everywhere nowadays, so why buy a smartphone when you can get a phone with Wi-Fi capabilities for a much lower price, and without having to buy a data plan?I've had it for about 3 weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints. The battery lasts about 3-4 days and that's with a good number of hours using it (mostly texting or listening to music).So if you want to buy something definitely worth the money that not only functions great but LOOKS great, this is the phone for you. Best $120 I ever spent!",172,5
Nokia,"First off I love the phone after I got everything figured out. Basically all I had to do was pop my sim card out of my existing (AT&T Customer) phone and I was good to go, sort of! lol From that point I could call my contacts, send text messages, and even connect to the internet via wifi. Now the problems I discovered shortly there after was it connected to the wifi but could not go to any webpages because it would time out. It would not even go to the nokia pre-loaded store icon on the phone. Well, I could tell that there was settings not configured somewhere because it is unlocked for different carriers and needed at&t settings entered. Another problem I encountered was I could send text and recieve them just fine but could not recieve or send pictures with text messages succesfully. That was aggrevating because I could do that with my old phone just fine, but not this one. I found the solutions to fix these problems on-line after searching for awhile. So if you want these problems fixed here they are:MMSMenu > Settings > Configuration > Personal Settings > Options > Add New > Multimedia MsgAccount Name: AT&T MMSServer address: [...]Use pref.

Just thought I would pass this info along because you will encounter these problems with at&t as your carrier. Overall I would definitely buy the phone again because it is Nokia quality and thats hard to beat in my opinion!!",85,4
Nokia,"Hi Everyone,I would 've given -ve rating if it's possible. I ordered a new Unlocked Nokia phone from this seller and what I received was totally surprising. First of all it was not an unlocked phone instead it was an AT&T phone which was in a contract period. Moreover they send the phone inside an plastic envelop with a duplicate battery charger, apparently without any accessories and manuals.I contacted the seller for the refund then he started giving excuses like you should 've read the details. It was clearly mentioned on Amazon that its a NEW and UNLOCKED phone with all accessories. Somehow I was able to convince him for the refund and shipped the phone back to the seller's address given by the seller himself.Its been more than three months now and I didnt even get a penny back. The seller is saying that he didnt receive it back however I confirmed from the shipping company that it was delivered on the destination on time.I lost my money and still didnt get the phone I ordered. I had to order another phone from some other seller.So guys think twice before you even visit this seller's page on Amazon. Friendly advice to all of you find some other seller.

Nokia,"I traveled Europe for R&R while I was stationed in Afghanistan with the US Army. I wanted a decent, yet inexpensive phone that would enable me to purchase cheap pay-as-you-go SIM cards for every country I visited. This phone fit the bill perfectly.

It is very Facebook, Twitter, MS Chat, and E-mail friendly, and it has a full QWERTY keyboard. and it even offers Wi-Fi capabilities so that you can take advantage of hotspots! Oh I also neglected to mention that there are lots of apps available for the phone as well. For instance, when I was in London, I downloaded an interactive map of London's Tube system. When I get home This phone is going in my travel drawer right next to my adapter plugs and my passport. It's great!I do have one complaint.

Like all Nokia's I've used, it is well built, has excellent voice quality and it has a long battery life. She can text on it as well as any other phone she has had, and the wi-fi is a really great feature for this price-range phone. I thought I wanted 3G capability, but frankly in practial day-to-day use not having it has not been a negative in any way.",10,5
Nokia,"Firstly, it's a great price for an unlocked phone that can be used with AT&T, TMobile, prepaid, and any other GSM (SIM card) service providers worldwide. I'm not going to repeat the technical specifications. It is very light, portable and has excellent battery life. You can talk for a really long time. Make sure to turn off WIFI when it's not being used. This phone is perfect for everyday use, or as a backup or a second phone. I love the FM radio.It also makes a decent gift.I would recommend it over any carrier branded phone. It is always cheaper in the long run to get an unsubsidized phone.",62,5
Nokia,"I'm on a contract with T-Mobile, and I wanted to get a new phone while still on the contract, so I initially got the Nokia C1-01, which I bought from Amazon as well, however I didn't have access to picture messaging nor internet. I thought that for $120 on Amazon, that the Nokia C3-00 was a steal that combined a good amount of features like wi-fi and EDGE network access and custom shortcuts balanced with a reasonable and frugal price, so I got it.When the phone arrived, it was as simple as just swapping the SIM cards (as it usually is with any GSM phone, and some newer CDMA phones) from my old phone with the Nokia C3-00; I still wasn't able to use picture messaging, but I was sold on the Wi-Fi, the EDGE network support and the Mail and Contacts custom shortcuts.I started doing some occasional internet browsing with the phone; while not all websites are available or nicely viewed on the phone, Google Mobile adapted most of the webpages to be viewed with the phone. While on Wi-Fi I was able to attain speeds of 1500 kbps (kilobits). The phone was UNLOCKED !!!! I was finally going to be able to run Gmail and Google Maps without having to get a Blackberry or an iPhone, and it did so beautifully (read the instructions on how to use Google maps, otherwise you'll be a little frustrated when trying to pan in/out and zoom in/out the map).One good day TMOBILE sent me an update, and the phone did ask me if I wanted to apply the update, but I must have pressed the wrong key and it applied the update which rendered my phone unable to do all the nice things that it was able to do before: I was left with a boring gray background, only the Nokia ringtone left to choose, the custom shortcut keys no longer worked (couldn't even choose something else for them to do), and clicking on the browser did nothing.To cut a long story short, I called Tmobile asking them why they were sending updates to my phone...they were not aware. They told me that they couldn't provide me with much support since I had bought the phone from somebody else...that's perfectly understandable.I was however expecting good customer support from Nokia and they failed to deliver: I called a total of 5 times that solved nothing, and in between those calls, Nokia would advice every time to contact T-Mobile to provide me with values to access the web..I just couldn't get them to understand that it was the applications that failed to respond. I was asking to return the phone to its factory OS condition. They got me to update the phone from OS version 4 to 8, but did nothing either.I am looking now at going to some sort of Android OS phone....Symbian is just dead and you can't get as much info.The phone itself is a nice one, but since I assume that you'll be buying it to run on either AT&T or T-Mobile, I just wanted to warn you about what could happen to you, and complain about the poor Nokia support",35,1
Nokia,"This is a great product. It's small, but feels solid in your hand. Has a GREAT battery. I text a lot and I was used to having to charge my battery daily. With this phone, the battery lasts AT LEAST two days, and that's with heavy texting and limited internet usage. Well constructed. Shows conversational style text. You can attach ringtones and photos to your contacts. You can set up recurring appointments. It has an alarm which works really well. You can use up to an 8GB micro SD card with it. If you have AT&T service (which I do) you need to know how to configure it so that you can receive multimedia (picture) messages and access the internet. I have the instructions for the configuration, which I will enter below. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good phone, but doesn't want to pay for a 'smart phone'. You can get unlimited data (internet) usage for $10/month (again, AT&T) versus $25/month for what they consider to be a 'smart phone'. Okay, it isn't blazing fast on the internet (uses Edge rather than 3G or 4G), but it's fast enough for me. I don't actually use it for the internet a lot because I prefer to use my computer for that. Multimedia messaging works great. It does everything I want it to do and I've been used to using the Samsung Blackjack II and Jack. I've been a cell phone user since 1995. Again, I highly recommend this product.

Nokia,"When I saw this phone I knew it was the phone for me..pink my fav. color. The tracking info stated that I would get it by 2/8/1, however it came 3 days before that date. When I opened the box and saw the actual phone the picture doesn't do the phone justice. For the girls that love, love pink this is the phone, needless to say something lady like.As I began to use the phone I ran into a few snags, I couldn't get the internet, so because I have AT&T I called them for some assistance. Boy, I have to tell you that experience was so frustrating I can't begin to tell explain what I was feeling!!!!!!! So in there explanation AT&T advised me to contact Nokia, my goodness it felt just like I was speaking with AT&T, let me tell you this went on for 6 hours with me trying to get some help, by then I was almost ready to pull my hair out.I felt just like a tennis ball getting hit back and forth between AT&T & Nokia putting the blame on each other. So I had a light bulb moment something said call the company where I purchased the phone from to see if they could help. I called and explained my frustration and the staff person actually listened, he really listened! OK, I began to feel like I was batting a thousand .The gentleman stated that he would have 1 of his tech call me back to assist me about 1 hour went by and I got a call from the gentleman stating that they were having some pc issues and that he wanted to let me know that he didnt forget about me. Which was sooooo nice.So the next day I called it took all of 15 minutes to fix a small issue that the large companies couldn't fix in 6 hours. Now that's what I call great and outstanding customer service, needless to say that I'm still in love with my cell phone. This is a great company to purchase items from I have spread the word. Great phone and outstanding customer service..WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!. :0)",12,5
Nokia,"Bought 2 of these Nokia C3-00 phones. Neither one was fully unlocked. They had phone, text and camera capabilities but NO multi-media functions what so ever with AT&T sim cards. Had each phone examined by AT&T and by an independent cellular specialist and was told, ""NO, these phones are NOT fully functional with AT&T and cannot be fully unlocked because AT&T never sold or supported this model."" Phones have been returned and I am awaiting refunds.",26,1
Nokia,I gave this two stars because this phone is being sold as an unlocked GSM phone however the phone was packaged with a 'Rogers pay as you go'booklet.Therefore the phone was recieved locked. Communication with the seller the OEM shop was not helpful and eventually after six days when prompted they replied that they did not have a code and I could return it if i wanted.,22,2
Nokia,"If you know what you are getting, then this phone will pretty much keep you satisfied. If you are expecting full feature smart-phone capabilities, then you will be very sorry. One shouldn't expect all those feature for this price. Fair enough?- WiFi for under $100? Wi Freaking Fi!!! No phone to my knowledge at this price range has that. Useful to check my email and do some light informative surfing on the web at hotspots.- This phone has the same battery as my Nokia Xpressmusic 5800 but lasts two to three times longer since this isn't a touch screen. With light use, my phone can last a week before charging again.- Cannot multi-task; which means you would be able to use one program at a time. You need to close an app to use another. No biggie, I knew that.- Qwerty fairly easy to use after getting used to. All buttons are nicely lit for night use.- Symbian S40 is the handicapped version of Symbian S60. It is basic and easy to use but lack the additional tools of S60. Once again, I knew what I was getting.- Has access to Ovi store to download free apps and games.- Call quality is clear and it does not drop calls. Sound is crisp and clear.- Good and nice bright screen.- Camera has no flash, but pretty decent quality for a 2MP phone camera. I don't expect Nokia N8 picture quality.- Micro SD card slot is on the side and not under the battery like some phones.- No physical volume control button. Can turn off some people. For me, I can just use the on screen volume control.- Decent build quality.- Just for reference, I compared this phone side by side with my friend's iPhone 4 and this Nokia phone is smaller in size.- Unlocked. Popped in my T-mobile simcard and I was good to go.Got this phone as a temporary phone for now after losing my main cell-phone. I will upgrade when I have more money down the road.Once again...know what you are getting and you will be happy with this product. Don't expect this phone to be something more than an entry level smart phone. This phone gets the job done for me and it looks great. Well worth one Franklin.",21,5
Nokia,"This phone is amazing. For $120, Nokia really hit the nail on the head this time.Wi-Fi:This is probably my favorite feature of the phone. While most phones that have Wi-Fi are smartphone and require a data plan from the carrier, this phone doesn't. It has wi-fi, but it's NOT a smartphone. This is a great feature for those of us who want to browse the internet or check email, without being tied to an annoying contract. And let's face it, there's wi-fi almost everywhere now so finding a connection shouldn't be hard. The wifi is fast a reliable on this phone, and it's just so convenient.Screen:The screen is terrific for such a budget phone. The resolution isn't crazy high, but it's very crisp and easy to read. As far as I know, there is no option to adjust the brightness of the screen, but that's not a big problem because the brightness is perfect for all situation. Even in sunlight, the screen is remarkably readable.Battery Life:I only go the phone yesterday, so I really don't know about the battery life. According to other websites, however, it has 7 hours or talk time. Not impressive, but still pretty good. It also depends on if your wi-fi is turned on and stuff like that.UI (Interface):This phone uses the Nokia S40 use interface. This interface is pleasantly simple, yet has all the features you need. There are a few apps that come preloaded onto the phone, but whenever I try to go to the OVI Store, it says this phone is not compatible. This might be an issue with the browser or maybe the phone just ISN'T supported. But that shouldn't be too much of a problem because people shouldn't buy this phone expecting an iPhone. The phone also gives you easy access to your favorite social networks from the homescreen, which I find a great feature paired with the included wi-fi (I don't have a data plan).QWERTY Keyboard:The keyboard is perfect. The keys may a little small and intimidating, but even for those of us who have thick fingers, typing will become a breeze. The keys are stiff enough to prevent accidental presses, but at the same time, they are easy to press. Perfect combination, eh? Also, I've noticed that on a lot of phones, the keys make a loud *click* noise when they're pressed. This phone barely even makes a noise. I would have to say that the navigation pad above the QWERTY keyboard is a little ""loud"" at first, especially the directional pad, but you soon get used to it.Text Messaging:I couldn't be happier with the texting experience on this phone. The messages are displayed in a conversational manner for each contact, and you can even assign the dedicated e-mail key to go to the conversations (texting) screen. I find this really helpful because it let's me keep track of who I was talking to and what I was talking to them about.Email:The email on this phone is good. The ""app"" takes about 6 seconds to load up after you press ""Mail"" in the menu, but then it's pretty quick. You can have multiple accounts, and all you have to input is you username and password. The phone does the rest, so no need to find the server addresses and ports or whatever you need. I've never really had email on a phone, but I must say it's very convenient.Internet Browser:There are 2 internet browsers that I'm aware of. I have no idea what the default first one is called, but the second one is Opera Mini. I personally like the first one better better, and that's because you control the cursor with the directional keys, while in Opera Mini, you basically use them to select an element..... It's hard to explain. Also, the internet is fast if you have fast wifi. This phone only supports EDGE and GPRS, so no 3G. (YouTube works, but the videos only play in low resolution).Media Player:The media player is great on this phone, too. There are many different file formats that the phone can play. It can even play MIDI audio files (I've never seen that on a phone). My favorite part about the player is them including a 5-band equalizer. This equalizer greatly improves the sound quality. I have mine set to - left to right - HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH. The headphones that come with the phone aren't the greatest, so using a different pair would drastically improve the sound quality.Classy Look:This phone looks pretty awesome. The area around the screen is this plastic material but it's reflective so it's looks really luxurious. The battery cover is made of metal (aluminum I think), and that really gives it a ""heavy"", quality look. I actually ordered a case with the phone (Premium Crystal Skin Case for NOKIA C3 / Clear Tinted) and it fits perfectly, I highly recommend it. The keyboard is sort of a matte finish, and it makes the key comfortable to type on. The device as a whole is just gorgeous, and to be honest, it really looks like a ""Nokia BlackBerry"" or something. I really like the look.Camera:The camera is a 2 MP camera, with digital zoom, but no flash, and no auto-focus. The picture quality on the phone is average for phones in this price range. The pictures look like visual effects have been slammed onto them. I would recommend using the camera to take the occasional picture of somebody to put as a contact, but that's about it. The video camera is, I believe, QVGA resolution @20FPS, (or 15, not quite sure), which isn't great but it gets the job done.Call Quality:The sound quality of the phone is great. I've had no problem hearing anybody, and vice versa.--VERDICT--I would say the only flaw with this phone is that it doesn't make me sandwiches. But all kidding aside, I really do love this phone. My favorite features are the amazing QWERTY keyboard, the included wi-fi networking capabilities, and the threaded text messaging. What more could you want for a $120 phone that's not ""smart"" (hehe). The fact that it has wi-fi but isn't a smartphone is great. You can browse the internet without getting tied up in data plans and contracts and all that stuff because it's unlocked. The browsing experience is good, and the email is convenient. The social network integration to the home screen is great because you don't have to browse to the website or whatever. All-in-all, this is a great phone and I'm very happy I bought it. Oh yes, by the way, it makes calls. :PEDIT 2/5/2012 - Regarding the battery life, this phone has AMAZING battery life. In the review I said it was average, but after using it for a longer time, I can go 5 days with average/heavy use and still have 2/3 bars. It seems insane, but it's true. However, that might be due to the fact that I don't access AT&T's data features, which may drag the battery life down a bit if used frequently.",19,5
Nokia,"I wanted to like this phone, I really did. In fact, after buying the stripped down version that is offered as a GO Phone, I decided that I really wanted the full-up version (with wi-fi), returned it, and bought this phone from Amazon.I happily played around with various features until the first problem showed up. While there is an icon for the OVI store on the phone, and you can use to phone to go to the OVI store, you can't buy anything from it!Secondly, in the three days that I had this phone, over 50% of the time I could not use the phone as a phone! It kept dropping the network. Sometimes, I could get it to log back in by turning the phone off and on, but sometimes not. Sometimes, the icon was gone, showing me at a glance that the phone was not logged into the network, but sometimes the icon WAS there even though the phone was not logged in, as it would tell me if I tried to make a call.I have returned the phone and am waiting on a refund.So, in short, you have here an app device that you can't buy apps for and a phone that you can't make or take calls with. Not ready for primetime, eh, Nokia?",14,1
Nokia,"This is like a Tale of Two Cities - it was the worst of times, it was the best of times. The phone is great. It has good sound quality, useful features, good fit-and-finish. The speakerphone works exceptionally well. I searched around for a decently priced phone (you can get this unlocked for $120 shipped) that could sync my contacts, calendar and task list, would work as a tethered modem, could link to an email account and had web access. This is what I ended up with.The down side is that the sync software offered by Nokia is total crap. DO NOT use the Ovi Suite software if you need to sync your Outlook data - it has a nasty habit of overwriting your Outlook data file. If you are lucky, it will just create a mess. If you are unlucky - well, I hope you backed up your data lately. Much less problematic is Nokia's PC Suite - it is the predecessor to Ovi Suit. It too has problems (I could only get it to sync 30 contacts at a time) but it is much less buggy. The down side to PC Suite is that Nokia is abandoning its support/updates for this software. Right now, there are plenty of forums that provide good answers to common problems.If this phone does not have the features you want go to phonescoop.com and click on the ""phone finder"" link. It is a GREAT time saver. You put in the features you want it it will spit out a list of all phones with your criteria.",14,4
Nokia,"Couldn't find a phone with Wi-Fi for under $200 in The Bahamas but this one is awesome. It is quick, light-weight and easy to use. I had an LG Cookie which was touch screen and the calibration seemed to be a bit off so I thought ""Let me just stick to the old model $50 nokia that I got when I was back in high-school"" Then I found THIS nokia! Same great brand with newer apps and features. I'm in love with my new phone <3 !!",14,5
Nokia,"Since I was due for an early upgrade on my plan, I checked around in the AT&T store for non-smartphone messaging-only options that did not require a data plan. Sadly, there were just a handful of options, half of which were unappealing flip style phones that I used over 10 years ago. AT&T store personnel stated that AT&T is intentionally driving existing customers to higher revenue smartphone and data plans and de-emphasizing messaging-only phones.*sigh*. Thanks for reducing customer options AT&T.So the search began to see what options existed in third party unlocked phones. The Nokia C3-00 caught my eye largely because it looked very much like my previous QWERTY bar phone, but it also had FM stereo and Wifi capability which had the potential to dramatically improve its day-to-day flexibility. In addition, user reviews across multiple internet review sites gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews.Before purchase I had some initial concerns about whether or not AT&T would identify the phone on their network as a smartphone since it uses the Symbian S40 operating system. AT&T said the phone's IMEI number is not among their list of smartphone IMEI's. I've gone through my first billing cycle and can confirm no forced smartphone data plan charges were assessed.As for the phone itself, day-to-day use has been great. Plugged my SIM card into it from the old phone (Pantech Link) and its worked beautifully right out of the box from day one. No problems at all.Battery life is typically 3-4 days between charges with moderate texting and several hours of daily FM stereo usage at work. Better than expected.Wifi works OK, not very speedy, but it does enable access to personal email and MSNBC/CNN at Starbucks. Just don't expect an iPhone-type browsing experience. It's basic but gets the job done. Better than expected. Note: If you DO opt for a data plan for this phone, bear in mind that it's an EDGE phone, not a 3G phone, so your data transfer speeds under a paid data plan will likely be a little underwhelming.FM stereo works super and is a nice inclusion on a phone at this price level. Earphone cord acts as the antenna and must be plugged in for reception. Sounds great, and again, better than expected.Keyboard is typical QWERTY layout. I found the tactile feedback quite pleasant and was easier to text on it than previous phone.Call quality is very good. No dropped calls. I can hear callers loud and clear and they can hear me the same.Nothing bothersome about the texting experience. It has a conversation mode similar to other phones and it works well. Only complaint is that individual texts within a conversation will only display the first two lines of the text. You have to drill into the text to see it fully. Not terribly annoying, but adds an extra step to the texting process. I suppose you have to accept some compromises when working with a 2.4 in display screen.Overall, I'd have have to say this has been a terrific phone choice for me. At $99, it's priced very well, offers expanded feature content and NO DATA PLAN requirement. It's a worthy option to similar carrier-provided messaging phones and a great value. Very happy camper.",17,5
Nokia,"UPDATE! I had one of the first reviews for this phone, (maybe the first?) on Amazon and I can no longer recommend this phone for US customers. No US GSM carrier has sold this phone so Nokia has apparently decided it is not worth supporting in the US. They have some way of identifying the hardware and the new firmware is not available or downloadable through their software application. They have not only added features but according to release notes they have added bug fixes. Great, now I know I have a phone with software bugs that will never be fixed. My phone is also dropping calls indoors where I have never had problems with previous phones. I wonder if that is one of the bug fixes.I tried to open a ticket with Nokia customer support, this was my response from May 3rd.Thank you for contacting Nokia.You will be receiving a reply from one of our Customer Care Representatives at the earliest.Have a good day.It's June 9th, haven't heard a thing. Nice way to treat your customers.I had to replace the phone on my ATT plan ( Nokia Mural ) because the battery life was horrible, it dropped calls, would not receive calls and the menu navigation was awful.I am not interested in a smart phone. My top priorities are battery life, call quality and ease of use. I could also care less about a camera in a phone. I also carry my phone in my pocket so the size and shape of this phone is important. For the 2 weeks I have owned this phone it has met all of these criteria. I went 3 days before the first charge and that was after playing with all the phones features like WLAN, bluetooth camera and media player and I still had battery left. The call quality is superb, people talking to me on the other end have also noticed the difference, no dropped callls so far. The ring volume is EXCELLENT! The main screen and goto menus are totally customizable so if you don't find this phone easy to use it is your own fault. The resistive touch makes navigation easy. The screen is also very clear and the picture quality is excellent. Texting uses the traditional key pad and utilizes the touch feature for special charachters. This phone is thin and the back is rounded so it carries well in my pocket, sometimes I forget it is there.Now for the extra features. The camera takes pretty awful pictures but I find that true with most phones. Flash photography on this thing produces incredibly washed out colors. I the WLAN feature is great!, the default browser is very poor but it also comes with Opera Mini web browser pre-installed and that works surprisingly well. This does not surf the web as well as a ""smart"" phone but it is certainly tolerable. One of my favorite features is the * button can be held down for 3 seconds to turn on the camera flash for a flashlight. Love it! So far the software support from Nokia is poor because the phone is so new. There is no ActiveSync which I think is true for most phone. SUPL location, which uses tower triangulation to find your location, is available but I have not found an app that it works with yet. The java google maps does not support the touch screen. It comes with a built in mail app which support gmail. The is no plugin yet for Apple iSync. Hopefully there will be better software choices the longer this phone is out. The music player is relatively good, decent sound and a regular sized headphone jack is awesome. I also appreciate the ability to charge with both the Nokia barrel charger and micro usb.I own an ipod touch which senses electrical conductivity, this phone differs in that it uses resistive touch which senses pressure. It is not as sensitive but has the advantage of not exposing a glass surface ( possibly more durable ) and you could still use it with gloves on. Once you get use to using the touch on this phone it goes smooth. It seems to work best with your thumb.I would recommend this phone to anyone who likes to use their phone as a phone.",28,1
Nokia,"I purchased this phone as a gift for my teenage daughter, she loves the phone...Initially, she was upset at me as I didn't ask her about her thoughts on what kind of phone she would prefer, so I thought I could use this phone if she didn't like it, well, after playing a bit with it, she got in love with this nice piece of technology...She is used to texting via traditional keypad, so she loves the idea of navigating through menus and options via the touchscreen while keeping the phone keypad for dialing and texting functions. Quality of the phone is great (my daughter has tons of pics she can keep in a large memory microSD card, so this is a plus too), the phone feels very resistant and the silver version is very elegant, fits perfectly into small pockets. You'll need to adjust touch screen sensitivity to your preferrences, but the phone has a good feature for completing this task easily. 3G and Wifi capabilities works great in my country, and even when my daugthers' sim card is from 2G technology, the phone has extraordinary reception at areas where her previous 2-3 Nokia phones (various Music express models) never had signal. Quality of pictures are awesome (have not used the flash at this time, but we'll see...). Overall, I highly recommend this phone for someone who needs good battery performance, nice quality pictures, all good stuff such as music, videos, etc., good signal reception and also wanting to keep keypad control for dialing/ texting while improving menu navigation through touch screen...Great product!",16,5
Nokia,"I bought this from [...] (via Amazon), but I currently live in Costa Rica. I love this phone. It has powerful reception where other have little or none at all. Sound and image quality of the screen is great. It comes packed with a great deal of software, and the Ovi Store had everything else I needed for free. The 2GB mini SD memory it comes with has been more than enough for me to this point. Assuming this device is wonderful (for the given price), my only cons are:* It can't be recharged via usb* Pictures taken with the main camera appear a little blueish. Probably need to play a little more with the ISO / White balance settings...* When using the sliding keyboard, the upper row of keys is uncomfortable to reach using your thumbs.* It sometimes ""became a little confused"" when you make certain movements, rotating the screen when you didn't need it.Sadly, Ovi Maps doesn't have one for my country, which is very disappointing, as I was misinformed of this from the Nokia website, but now I'm getting used to this and looking for alternatives.Friends of mine who have Sony Ericsson Xperia or Nokia n97 where amazed with this device, because of a higher image quality in the first case, and an easier to use sliding keyboard and very similar functions at a cheaper price in the latter.",10,4
Nokia,#N/A,55,3
Nokia,"I am overall satisfied with this phone, Pros: I like the fact I can pop my operator SIM without jailbreaking/unlocking the phone - built in wifi, full bluetooth functionality, fm radio, and gps are very nice to have and enable many interesting apps and uses. Home screen panels let you put shortcuts and content all in one place. You can use it as a mobile hotspot with the JoikuSpot app. Ovisotre has a good amount of additional apps, and there are a lot of Symbian applications that can be installed from the PC or directly in the phone. The full qwerty keyboard is very nice and the battery life is good even with moderate to heavy browsing gps navigation. you can also carry a spare battery. the camera is good by smartphone camera standards.Cons: I have not been able to hook yahoo, hotmail or gmail account with the built in email program, I had to use a third party app called Emoze. Too bad the built in app can't be used as a regular pop3 / imap client. The built in sms messaging app does not support threaded views, you'll have to buy an additional app for that (ThreadSMS - at least it is cheap). You'll want to replace the included 2Gb micro sd card (almost filled with OviMaps files) with a bigger 4Gb or 8Gb one if you are planning on uploading many music files / videos, etc. you cannot charge the phone via the usb port. The phone does not include a stylus, you can get the job done with your fingers or nails, but for some operations it would be nice to have the extra precision.In summary this is a nicely priced phone given the specs and features it has, and most shortcomings can be solved with additional apps, memory.",47,4
Nokia,"This is my third Nokia phone and as usual I am very satisfied with this phone.I brought this phone when it had no reviews. Just after buying the phone, I saw some negative reviews after I purchased but still thought of giving it a try. I am happy I did not return it without trying it myself.The basic features of this phone are really great. It has excellent signal strength and sound clarity. Also touch screen works quite fast and it is very easy to use just like other Nokia phones. The only issue with the phone is the memory which is 2GB but can be extensible up to 16GB. If you use maps, your memory will get exhausted very fast. The camera and music players are also very good.",45,5
Nokia,"I purchased this phone to replace my Nokia E63 because I wanted a phone with a touchscreen and a full keyboard. Here are what I think are the pros and cons so far:PROS:Nice size touchscreen, very bright and vibrant.Disregard what the previous reviewer said about the blue stripe on the bottom of the phone because THERE IS NONE. The plastic cover on the screen has a blue stripe but the actual phone is COMPLETELY WHITE.Camera quality is great and shutter speed is super quick.Keyboard is easy to use and keys are big.Interface is simple and easy to understand.CONS:A little bulky.Camera could get scratched easily since there is nothing to cover it.Definitely will need a screen protector.One other thing that I found to be more of a nuisance than anything else is that the GPS positioning option was turned on by default so every couple of minutes it would activate itself and eat up a few cents of the money on my phone. Luckily it was easy to turn off so nothing to worry about anymore.Overall I really like this phone. I've only had it for a short time but so far I haven't had any problems with it. I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a touchscreen phone with full keyboard that is also budget-friendly.",42,4
Nokia,"This phone looked great online, but after only 3 days I can't wait to return it. If this phone is Nokia's answer to the I-Phone they have a long way to go! First of all it will not stay connected to WiFi. The phone constantly loses the WiFi connection and I have to manually select to connect back to it only to lose the connection again a few minutes later. I don't know if this particular phone is defective or if that's how they all are, but my computer and I-Touch stay connected to WiFi just fine so I know its not my network. Well I figured no big deal because I have a data plan (that my Blackberry worked fine on) but even this is slow. Retreiving emails and using Facebook is so painfully slow that it's pretty much unusable. The interface is also slow and the phone constanly freezes. The phone catches up after a couple seconds but constantly waiting for it while you are trying to navigate screens is maddening. The phone looks great and has alot of features but its functionality is terrible. I would not buy it.",31,1
Nokia,"This is my first smart phone. In the past, I've always opted for cheap and typically prepaid, but after finding I could not call an international cellphone with my cheap Tracfone, and a major disaster had occurred in the country I was flying to, I decided that having a phone that would not work in the country I was heading to, nor the ability to make cellular contact, if I chose, it was time to upgrade.I can now make international calls to cell phones and landlines. Because the phone was unlocked, it gave me the option to choose what phone I wanted in my price range and to choose between the GSM cell providers. The wireless works great. I can use the wireless feature to access my email and other web functions without having to get charged by a wounded bull (ATT) for traffic. The qwerty keyboard is better than many I have ever seen. The keys are a lot bigger, but the phone is still smaller than the latest HTC models.Some people have complained about the touch screen not being sensitive enough and that it's better to use a stylus. I find that it is just fine with my fingers. Yes, it doesn't seem completely solid when it's in a closed state (when the keyboard isn't in the slide-out mode), but it does feel solid when you are using the qwerty.Also, I love the fact that I don't have to use the qwerty keyboard to dial a number - the onscreen touch numerical keyboard works fine. There are some features that I haven't explored yet, but it has great sound when you're playing music and while it's loaded with some applications I didn't care for (Myspace, Friendster etc), you don't have to keep them.While it comes with a 2gig chip, I upgraded to an 8 gig and you can go up to 16gig, which is a nice option if you want to use it as an MP3 player.Update August 2011: Extremely happy with my purchase. Flew back to New Zealand and picked up a 2degrees SIM card at the duty free shop, before clearing customs. By the time my luggage was checked for my next flight, I had a working phone and a New Zealand cell phone number - without the nasty international roaming charges. (The phones will also work with Vodafone NZ's SIMS.)",29,5
Nokia,"yea, so I took a chance with this phone. It had no reviews and Amazon was advertising it, so I said, ""what the heck, I can always return it."" It had everything I was looking for, quality camera, slide out QWERTY pad, touch screen and priced right. It has a nice touch screen, although, it sometimes took too long to realize whether I had the phone sideways and to change accordingly. Wasn't too impressed with the camera quality and there is a lower grade secondary camera if you want a personal picture. If you try to take a picture of yourself using the main camera, you'll have a hard time finding the button because there is not one on the side so you can easily snap a picture. I'm not very literate to the smart phone world, so bear with me. The QWERTY pad is great, I liked it. Overall the phone was okay, I could have stuck with it. But 4 days after purchase, the deal breaker came when I was losing calls because the ringtones preloaded to the phone stopped working. I didn't change anything about the settings or volume, they just stopped working. Nothing else seemed defective, so I don't know what happened.I took a leap of faith and it didn't pan out. Oh well, on to the next phone!",23,2
Nokia,"Bueno, por si alg?§n compatriota leyera esto, le informo que el telefono funciona a la perfecci??n con el ICE, excelente cobertura, y todas las aplicaciones estan disponibles. Todo lo dem?­s informaci??n la pueden encontrar en los comentarios anteriores. Lo recomiendo al 100%!",18,4
Nokia,"I came from an N85 so I'm fairly familiar with Nokia phones in general and the Symbian OS in particular.I wanted a touchscreen phone that had a keyboard that was within my budget. I would have gone for the mini N97 but it's a bit pricey considering the C7, N8 et al are coming out soon.I've read almost all available reviews I can read online so if you did that then you know what you're getting into with this phone.The only thing that surprised me was the resistive touchscreen. I bought this phone expecting to return it immediately but the touchscreen compared to my capacitive 2G ipod touch is amazing. It's just as responsive and accurate. I was expecting to need a stylus or my nails to navigate the phone but you really don't!It is, however, a bit bulky but compared to the N85, it's pretty much the same.The NokiaMaps is redunkulous, tho.I LOVE it. The last time I checked it out was when I got my N85. The Nokia maps back then required a crazy-expensive yearly rate to use the turn-by-turn and was pretty much useless bec trying to enter an adddress REQUIRED a zipcode entry before it will search for it! This new interface works much like GoogleMaps (esp with an ovi account) and much easier to use. It has all the feature you can ever want on a stand alone GPS but you get a phone along with it!I specifically bought this phone to try out the NokiaMaps turn-by-turn while I rode my motorcycle. You can't beat an accurate GPS that you can plug your headphones/ bluetooth headset on and use while riding! And if you can find a suitable handlebar holder for the phone, you can mount it and still operate the phone with your gloves on bec of the resistive screen!The speakerphone is on the weakside bec it outputs to only one speaker so that's expected. The battery does not last more than 6 hours bec the data connection is ALWAYS active (bec of the widgets and GPS). It also doesn't charge off the USB but I can use my older Nokia chargers so that's ok.I'll update the downsides of the phone as I find em but so far, the last week of usage have been problem-free.",17,4
Nokia,"I was hesitatig about buying this product since there some reviews stating that this phone is below E72. Well, it is in absolute numbers since it does not come with secondary camera, which I've never used in E71 and E72, however, the SO is clearly more stable and runs faster, designed also to incorporate facebook and twiter among other social networks apps natively.Also, the assisted GPS computes your position faster than E72. I can say this because I did a simple benchmark between them. E5 took less than 10 secs, E72 more than 3 minutes.The keyboard, although similar in size and key distribution, is more comfortable, I guess it is due to an improved key shape and they are slighly wider, which is very noticeable when writing.The camera is 5MP, I guess is the same. I have to say that comparing only pixels in c?­meras is like comparing food only with calories or cars with hp. There are more things to evaluate.The construction.... well, I don't know why people complain a lot about plastic construction since it's very similar to that of the E72, all plastic but the battery cover, made of stainless steel, which gives a nice feeling. Ok, it is not fron a casting as the E71 but that doesn't mean it has a weak built, it feels rock solid and less suceptible to be damaged since it weights less and then less energy is needed to be absorbed, thus less prone to be damaged.In general conclusion it's a great phone, with less features like the secondary camera, which I never use, but it costs less and IT HAS improvements learned from the very unstable E72.",27,5
Nokia,"I bought this Nokia thinking it has a great feature set and I will admit that on paper it does, however when you get to using it that the problems start.Screen... I have a Blackberry for work and had a SonyEricsson for personal use; they have been banging around in my pockets along with my keys for close to a year now without a single problem or scratch. After half a day in that same pocket with the blackberry and keys the Nokia's screen is already scratched. This of course means they skimped another $1 on the coating for the screen and we all know the result.Features...I chose this phone because I thought I'd be able to use it with Skype anywhere I had a wifi connection and sometimes I can, but for the most part the reception is shaky at best when and only when it connects correctly and doesn't kick me off the network. I also had my SE connected to my car (Audi A4) via Bluetooth with a great function that let me read my phonebook from my car nav screen. The Nokia can't do it!! This really upset me so I did some research and discovered that Nokia did not include the complete Bluetooth stack in the phone and will not update this in the future. One would think that adding another small bit of software to create a better product would be a good investment, but apparently Nokia thinks differently.Battery Life...The battery lasts for ages and I will admit they did a great job with it. There is one thing about charging the phone that I do have a gripe with. This phone cannot be charged via USB. It has the connector for mini USB, but its only for data, a separate plug is needed to charge the phone. This of course means carrying around more cables. yay.Camera...The SE w810i I had also had a 2megapixel camera, but it had things like Macro and Autofocus so even though this phone has a 2 megapixel camera good luck using it without any kind of options or functions. I tried taking a picture of text as I often did with the SE to save some time and the hassle of pen and paper, now I can't even do that because this phone can't focus.Reception...The reception is great BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT 3G!!!!!!! Yes it is 3G in EUROPE, but ATT uses the 1900 UMTS frequency in the USA for 3G so it will not work with 3G in the USA. Goodbye blazing fast speeds when there is no WIFI.I had a Nokia a Long time ago and though it might be time to give it another try, but I think I'll wait another 5 years to try them again.",19,2
Nokia,"Most of the cameras today are aimed either for kids (like the chocolate), fashion conscious adults (the big hit razr), or business people (the bulky blackberry or treo).What if i want a phone that is sleek but also loaded with all the important business tools? well the E51 was a Godsend.This sleek phone comes with high speed 3G internet and WiFi connection. Gone are the days paying $15 to connect to the internet at airports and hotels. Simply use the mini usb cable or download a symbian based modem application and you can use your phone as your modem.The camera is decent (2mb) and since micro sd cards are so cheap nowadays (i bought a 4gb Kingston one at Amazon for $14) you can use this phone also as a portable mp3 player (stereo ear phones included).The best part of all though; it runs on Symbian. Download Opera mini and Google Maps (with a neat 'show current location function) and you have the capability to browse html pages and use the phone as a water down gps device.",14,5
Nokia,"I was looking for a good cell phone, PDA(calendar, notes, voice memo), music player, communication(wi-fi, bluetooth, web, modem, sync), and the priority is in that exact order. For that and this price point, this phone is great, 5-star.I got this phone in May, and I put in a Sandisk 4Gb microSDHC card that's good for now. I saw report that it'd take a 16Gb if I need that later.Pros:-Good size, quality built, very well designed, good battery life.-Very good phone. Call quality very good with the factory headset. Slightly worse with a Plantronic 815 bluetooth headset (still good).-Good function in calendar, meeting, reminder, alarm etc. I also recorded hour long voice memo in meeting no problem.-Music player is good both function and sound. Radio is a bonus plus. On full charge, I played music 10 hours straight with headset. Speaker good for both phone and music (won't compare it to full size boom box).-Bluetooth, wifi, sync, web all function properly.-Control keys are very good. A lot of customization can be done. When set up properly, very convient.-Predictive texting is very good. I don't write full length email with it so it's just right for me. Good for any basic use.-Lots of additional features are just welcome bonus for me. (camera, video, gps, voice command, games, application download, music ringtone, VOIP etc etc)Cons:-Small screen. 2.2 or 2.4 inch and larger letters would be better. (I think the length of it is just right and can be a little bit wider)-If it comes with the new WH-700 stereo headset instead that'd be cool.-camera is so so.This phone is really good for what it is. If I want more texting or web/media viewing comfort, I'd probably go with the nokia E90 or HTC Touch Pro or Advantage x7500. And if I want to really use it as a computer I would consider the Azus Eee ultra portable... as of today that is. With the upcoming models, we'd keep changing the way we use these devices.Hope it helps. When I research products, I found it very helpful from some of the reviews. This's a great feature on the web and I hope that I'm doing my part contributing to it.cheers.By the way, I use t-mobile. And as others reviewed, it looks cool and the operating system is stable and fast.",10,5
Nokia,"I have owned this phone for about a month now and I am very happy with the phone overall with some minor draw backs. I use this in Manhattan area with AT&T.Pros:1. very good reception. Full bar inside some subway stations (including Times Square on the 1,9 line, 2 stories below ground)2. good battery life. batteries go up to 4 days without charging with ~30 min talk/day +some texting and web browsing.3. W Lan connection a breeze.4. works well with ATT internet by media net, relatively fast and reliable connection. (can't comment on 3G, haven't used it)5. Screen seems scratch resistant. probably has a glass cover. put the phone in my pocket with keys several times. not a scratch so far.cons:1. media player less than adequate2. no asian language support (apparently you have to go to nokia service center to get the hardware flashed in order to add extra language support)3. SD card gets stuck in the slot frequently, had to remove it using an pocket knife (ouch my new phone). may be an isolated case.",15,4

Nokia,"I recently bought the NOKIA E6 and have to say that its all I wanted from a combination touchscreen and qwerty. The Symbian Anna OS is very responsive and precise, the browser is superb and easy to input URL address, save bookmarks and scroll between open pages. It supports one exchange account and multiple gmail and other services emails, push email is easily enabled in the settings for both exchange and gmail accounts. The keyboard is superb, better than E71, as the buttons are somewhat wider and tactile perception is superb. 8 MP camera pics are great and easy to share to with social networks and by email. Overall I am highly satisfied with this touchscreen qwerty combo in the E71 form.",12,5
Nokia,"So I basically buy a phone a month. Androids, lg's, samsungs, every nokia (except the n8 and n9 - no keyboards) and I keep praying that one will be the one. This e6 is it so far, even with the most serious Nokia problem ever.why? because so many other things have been fixed - but not all.I will try to list all issues with e6 especially as compared to older e72, e63, n97, n97mini, e7, astound (c7)This e6 does have Anna from factory. Only 8gb of internal mem. SDhc slot. Ultra fast boot up, screen shows main screen in about 10 seconds, tho it does continue to load more in background such as bluetooth and wireless (wifi) connection. Very handy since you will experience random reboots (biggest problem ever! with any nokia!) Reboots happen most often when using the gps and phone is not mounted in a shockproof mount!Dont mistake the shockproof mount as the quality of the phone is superb as usual for nokia. This phone is by far the most useful phone ever made; especially from nokia.Main reasons this phone is the most useful:Speed - menus are almost instant!Change screens -instant!Email eyecandy is finally tolerable!menu key is instant! Stupid bug if you don't properly complete the factory setup questions, gives error everytime you start it complaining it cant find setup wizard which just dissappears quickly.Best parts of this phone:FASTNot windows, not ios, not android!Has almost all the google software as separate apps like maps and email!! Awesome.independent browser! Works awesome! (minus the pinch to zoom, which I hate. The volume controls do not operate the zoom-lame.)More space to hold phone at bottom beneath keyboard!directional nav key!No optical thumb dumb thingy as 'new' phones use - so no headaches in useability!Full capacitive touch screen which adds ultimate in efficient and speedy usability!nearly all touch buttons are intelligently sized and positioned!Full 3.5g speeds! (10mbs approx!)Tmobile full support, with free internet programability! No high speed data 'tax' (ie blackberry plan etc)Yes, I have it on my phoneweb plan for $10!Awesome nokia browservery very good email program including full mail for exchange imap support (but only one mail for exchange acct : with speed keys for navigation!Intelligent contact manager AND calendar - fast very efficient and most useful as compared to any 'new' smartphone!Very intelligent navigation - when done in one app such as looking at a calendar event by pressing calendar key inside of contacts, it will take you back to where you were - in the contact! AWESOMEvery bright dual leds for flash and flashlight.Full keyboard, but space bar removes some needed keys as it is too wide! E72 keyboard was much better.Main problems with this phone:Random reboots when in motion outside of fixed location when driving, biking etc) mainly when using gps/music, but does happen with nothing other than mail for exchange / email on homescreensCAMERA SUCKS for important pics! IT is fast, but there is NO Auto Focus! the N97 cameras kill this P.o.s.tight camera lock slide, grinds plastic after several days of constant use.phone auto locks after phone call is disconnected even if you are in the middle of typing a calendar event/contact etc (retarded)Phone still beeps annoyingly when other end of call hangs up before you do, I have been told over and over again that this is because of tmobile, um but this is an unlocked phone right ? so where is the setting??? Nokia? Do you ever listen??? No. Cause you are so awesome with your $6 stock price right?Go Stephan Elop! (nokia ceo)Bottom line:Best Business phone EVER. So incredibly sad that I have to plan on it rebooting while driving. Good thing it reboots in 10 seconds, almost fully in 15 seconds! (almost like they knew it has to reboot fast) haha",12,4
Nokia,"I've been on the smartphone band wagon from the beginning. I have used devices from every platform, and I have a high bar for satisfaction. The Nokia E6 does not completely satisfy me, but it does what I need and does it well.I really became tired of toys posing as phones. How many of you are sick of smart phones which fail the basic premise of being a phone? I know I am and that's what brought me back to Nokia. Simply put, Nokia makes the best phones.There's a myriad of criticisms I could throw at Nokia, more specifically Symbian. But despite it's short comings, it still manages to offer a compelling device in the E6. Any criticisms you read about the E6's email handling are absolutely true. It's rubbish. However, I have found ProfiMail which brings the power of desktop email clients to the mobile platform better than anything else. Its UI is questionable, but it's an excellent email client. I've never seen a client that handles IMAP boxes this well with incredibly fast and accurate searching. So if you're considering the E6 just go ahead and factor in the $24.99 to include ProfiMail in the price.Beyond that, all I have to say is VoIP. The E6 is a powerful SIP/VoIP device. This along with it's penta-band antennae/tuner make this an invaluable tool for the globe trotters out there. It's kinda painful to set up, but once you do you can have nearly free VoIP international calling in your hands.The other ""amazing"" aspect of this device is the battery life. With moderate use I need to charge my phone once every 3 days. Now you can carelessly install/configure software to suck your battery dry, but if you're conservative with the configuration you can have quick access to data intense applications and ""amazing"" battery life. I say ""amazing"" because the current standard for smartphones these days seems to be around 12 hours of moderate usage.Additionally, the bluetooth stack on this device is so much more advanced than anything out there. It's Bluetooth 3.0 and supports these profiles: A2DP, AVRCP, BIP, DUN, FTP, GAP, GAVDP, GOEP, HFP, HSP, OPP, PBAP, SAP, SDP, SPP. It's the only phone I've had that I could get to work with AcuraLink (Acura's in car messaging system). I know some others have mentioned issues with Bluetooth on this device, but my experience has been flawless.I have had problems with the E6, but they are on par with problems I've had with every single smartphone I've ever used (more than 30 different devices). The software is not perfect. It will occasionally lock up. You will have to reboot the device when this happens. I recommend being judicious with 3rd party software as this seems to be the root of most of those type of woes.Overall I'm considering purchasing a backup E6 to have when this device is lost/damaged/worn out. That's how much I'm appreciating this phone. I would also like to hedge my bets on Nokia's brain dead corporate direction in moving to the Windows mobile platform (Did the CEO even look at the amazing N9 before canning it?). If you keep your expectations reasonable and really want a smartphone that excels at being a phone, then you really can't go wrong with the E6.",21,4
Nokia,"After being a user of Nokia E71, E52 and E72, i was looking for a replacement of my Nokia E72.This is a good option, since i tested a Motorola Milestone with Android to see if Milestone 2 could be a winner. And it didn't seduce me.So, i bought this Nokia E6, installed the Lotus Traveler PushMail client, Nokia own client with HTML support, and went to the road. :)- Excellent battery life!- Excellent quality of audio over bluetooth (i have an A2DP car stereo).- Awesome screen quality. Resolution could be challenging at first, but it's great with very good legibility.- The same excellent quality of audio in phone calls, and great signal reception.The only not so good point is the notification light... It's VERY weak... But, with Remind Me for Symbian i solved the problem.RegardsMac",14,5
Nokia,"I purchased this phone (blue E63-2) three weeks ago. Overall, I am very happy with this phone. $200 for this unlocked smartphone is a great deal.I add my application background first in the following. Because I think a review will only be fair with certain application background. For example, for the email application, Blackberry is more powerful for the business user, it can have more functions or better performance when it is hooked up with your company exchange server. Also for data service performance in wireless network, I only use it in T-mobile network; I don't know how it performs in ATT's 3G network, so I don't comment on this.My service provider: T-mobileMy service package: voice + 100MB/month data serviceMy application: personal usePro:1. Full Q keyboard. Yes, a lot of smartphones have the full Q-keyboard. But the keyboard of E63 has the better design, the shape of each key enables you to type with less error-stroking.2. WI-FI: 802.11g compatible. The setup is very easy, it supports WEP/WPA/WPA2 wireless security features. And the link speed is very good. This enable me to go to internet and download applications at home (or hot-spot) without using the 100MB data-service bandwidth.3. When the ""bluetooth"" and the ""WLAN scanning"" are turned off, the battery life is GOOD; thanks to the physical size of the battery. When the ""WLAN scanning"" is off, you still can use the WLANs that have already been setup in the phone; it just won't search for the new WLAN. But for the ""bluetooth"", you will have to turn it on in order to use it; and the ""bluetooth"" seems draining more power than WIFI.4. Email service: I am using Nokia's free (for now) mail push service; it pushes my yahoo mails and the other mails to my E63, it notifies me when there is a new mail. Most time, it worked very quickly in T-mobile network (but my emails are more text oriented, HTML contents require additional download time). This is a great feature, I don't have to go to the internet to fetch the mails manually. One can download this email setup software from Nokia website. This is only available for BlackBerry and iPhone before, with a more expensive data service. (I don't know when Nokia will start to charge this service.)5. Completed PDA functions and reliable sync with PC (Syncing with PC by bluetooth is great!)6. Compare with the Nokia E71, I like this one better. The reasons are: lower-price and thicker body with plastic finishing. Although the body of E63 is plastic, but the texture feels very good and not easy to get the finger-prints. The thicker body has the acoustic advantage, the speaker performances well even when you are listening music. Of course, the lower price comes with the trade-offs: comparing with E71, the E63 does not have integrated GPS and the resolution of the camera is lower (3mp via 2mp)7. Music function: E63 has the 3.5 mm standard connector, which means you can use your favorite headset to listen to music. Although, the headset comes with the phone is stereo, and it has an in-line microphone; but the frequency response is not good enough to listen to music (if you are serious about listening). By using a standard headset, you still can make calls or receive calls, but you will have to speak to the microphone in the phone.Con:1. Image quality of camera. I can live with the 2MP resolution, but the noise of the camera is too obvious; even the pictures taken outdoor.2. Micro-USB cable is not included: This phone uses the Micro-USB interface, which is smaller than the mini-USB. I am sure most people have one or more mini-USB cables, which is widely used. But a lot of people don't have the micro-USB cable, at least I don't. So I have to go to a local shop to buy one ($15), and it is not easy to found one too. Very unfortunate, Nokia did not throw one in the box. Sometimes, it is very useful, such as when you want to copy a hundred songs to your phone's memory card; bluetooth is simply too slow to do this task.Update:Here is the update after three month use.(A) Don't put this phone into a case that is too tight; especially: preventing the keyboard to be touched when it is in the case. I found out if the keyboard is being touched, the phone will not go into the sleep mode and the battery runs out really fast.(B) The IP phone function(aka Internet phone) is great for the international long distant call (you must sign-up the ""Gizemo"" first), you can use it whenever you have the WIFI access; it cost much less than your wireless service provider's international plan. But after you finish a call, you should disconnect the phone from the WIFI completely; otherwise the battery goes down real quick. The reason is: as soon as you connect the IP phone service, it will contact the WIFI access point (such as your wireless router) periodically even when you are not making calls, this activity will use a lot of power.(C) The ""Remote lock"" is a great feature, and it is very easy to setup. First, you need to setup the ""lock code"" of this phone (after setup, write it down). Then enable the ""Allow Remote lock"" feature, it will ask a lock code again; it can be the same code in the FIRST step or a different one. If you lost your phone or simply forget your phone in the office; just grab another phone and send a text message to your phone, the message is the lock code. The message must contain the exactly same lock code, case must be matched and no extra space. Use another phone to send a text message is the best way to do it; some computer programs can send a text message to a wireless phone, but it tends to add some extra text in the message automatically, this will fail to lock the phone.",193,5
Nokia,"I want to start off saying that after using multiple phones over the years, I find this to be one of my top phones I have ever used.By being unlocked from the start, the phone is completely umbranded, meaning you don't have all of the cute AT&T or T-Mobile logos everywhere, and have complete access to all of the settings that most providers will restrict you from changing. You also have 110MB of space free on the phone (a ton) for basic apps, and of course you can buy a MicroSD card for even more memory.The phone itself looks great. The blue color is actually an extremely dark navy, and can look black in most cases. As for the thickness compared to the e71, I think it actually feels better in your hand, and isn't that noticeable. The headphone jack is a great touch, allowing you to use any headphone set you want.As for the software, it uses the Symbian 9.2 Feature Pack 1, and includes software you can use to open and edit Word and Excel documents on the go. The built in music player is decent, and set up like an Ipod with its ability to have playlists, genre searches etc. You can even download the free Divx player and watch movies to go! Then theres the Nokia Ovi store. Sort of like the App Store for the iPone, you can download apps directly from Nokia, although at the moment due to its recent launch, there aren't that many things (especially free) being offered.The WiFi was the deal sealer for me. Living on a college campus which has wireless internet all over, I didn't want to have to pay to have internet and email on my phone. Its fast (compared to a friend's iPone, about the same speed)and it is great for surfing, along with using the build-in YouTube application.There is a ton of great free software on the web for the phone if you look for it, things like weather applications, instant messaging, mapping software (requires either a WiFi or a data plan to use) etc.I find the speakerphone loud and clear, and good enough to play music over.The keyboard is absolutely amazing. I haven't experience many misspellings while using it, compared to my past palm treo I had. The keys are comfortable and easy to press down.Battery life is great on this. I was able to get 5 days out of a charge with light usage (30 texts per day, maybe 20 minutes on the phone per day and 10-15 minutes per day surfing using the WiFi)The cons I've found:Nokia still hasn't set up a threaded text messaging system as default (IM style chats). My Windows Mobile phone from 4 years ago has this feature, and Nokia has their own application which does this, but you cannot set it as the default Txt messaging.Weak vibration feature. I can barley feel it. My previous Nokia was weak as well though.The Operating System (Symbian) does not assume or remember any connection settings. If you open your web browser, each time it will ask you what connection you want to use. It can get annoying if you are constantly in the same place.Other Tips I've foundIf you don't have a data plan, go into the Network settings and change it to be GSM Only (NOT UMTS). UMTS is 3G, and you will get better battery life using GSM only with no downsides if not using the data plan.To change volume with internet radio, press the function key, and then the up and down keys change the volume.In media player, you can start typing the name of a song or artist using the keyboard and it will show up.",87,5
Nokia,"I've had the E63-2 (North American Version) for a few days now, and am really loving this phone so far. It's my first Symbian (S60) phone, so I was a little hesitant about the learning curve. And to be honest -- it's not anywhere near as intuitive as the iPhone or Android. But if you're a little bit tech savvy, it won't be a problem at all.The phone feels great in hand. I've held the E63's big brother, the E71, and I prefer this one better. The rubberized plastic doesn't feel cheap at all, offers a superior grip, and maybe best of all, doesn't get all smudged up with fingerprints. It's still relatively slim, though not as sleek as the E71. But again, I prefer it -- it's just easier to hold.The QWERTY is nicely designed, and the keys feel great to push. Numerically, the ""0"" is to the right of the ""9"" instead of underneath the ""8,"" which is kind of jarring at first, but I got used to it. Another design annoyance is the lack of a volume rocker on the side... you have to use the D-Pad, which means taking the phone away from your ear mid-conversation. No dedicated camera button either, but that didn't bother me much at all -- you can take a picture in two button clicks away from the home screen.Voice quality is crystal-clear, rivaling any land-line I've ever used. The ringer's nice and loud, though getting to the Sound settings themselves require a series of button pushes, instead of being ""right there.""The default mail client is decent, though I've run into some problems connecting to my ISP's POP3 mail server. I downloaded Nokia's new mail client, which is a lot more graceful.There are lots of apps available on the internet for this operating system, but they're scattered all over the place and they're hard to find unless you really know what you're looking for. However, that's going to change very soon, as Nokia's ""Ovi Store"" is set to open next month (May 2009). Looks very promising -- and even appears to have the elusive S60 Facebook app that's been conspicuous in its absence.Anyway, great UNLOCKED smartphone for the price. Might be lacking in some minor areas (no GPS, average camera quality, no volume rocker), but it makes up for it in others (WiFi, stable operating system, app store coming soon).Strong recommendation from me.",48,4
Nokia,"I was originally planning to purchase an iPhone. However, after seeing this phone on Amazon, along with many positive reviews and an excellent price ($150 after rebate), this phone looked to have the right price and features for my needs. In particular, I wanted strong messaging capabilities, WiFi, a few games, and reasonably capable web browsing to check the news, my RSS feeds, weather, stocks, etc. However, I really don't need (or want to pay for) the more advanced iPhone capabilities.I've had the phone for just over 2 days now, and my experience has been consistent with many of the other reviewers. For example, I really like the keyboard and overall construction and form-factor. The core applications like email, web browsing, calendar, and address book also meet or exceed my expectations. However, I found parts of the setup and configuration to be counter-intuitive and the software and handset as a whole to be less ""seamlessly integrated"" than I would have hoped for.The above being said, now that I've fully configured this phone, and I'm further along the Symbian learning curve, I believe for as long as I own this phone, it will prove to be an excellent value; i.e., it has excellent features, capabilities, and performance for the price.A few specific pros and cons include:* ""Virtual GPS"" with Google maps - If you purchase this phone, I'd definitely download Google Maps. Having done so, I was pleasantly surprised to find Google Maps used the cell-tower method to give a ""virtual GPS"" location within 200 meters (at least for me on AT&T), and fully integrated this information with its other capabilities.* Software and handset capabilities not seamlessly integrated - For example, I purchased a 4GB mini-SD card, and proceeded to fill it with hundreds of photos in numerous folders. By default, the built in photo browser doesn't include the folder structure on the SD card, but instead lists all the photos as one big flat list. There is a work-around to organize the pictures into a second set of ""folders"" on the phone, but why is this duplicate organization necessary? There are also 3rd party photo browsers you can download/purchase. As another example, I configured the start-up screen to show some contact information to call if someone finds my lost phone, but also configured the phone with a lock code; however, the phone only displays the startup splash screen *after* the lock code has been successfully entered, sort of defeating the value of my ""if found"" splash screen. In general, many of the features and capabilities on this phone work very well individually, but there's room for improvement to make all these features integrate more smoothly with respect to the likely workflow of a person using the phone.* Email setup was a snap - When I started using the phone, it prompted me with a step-by-step (wizard based) configuration of email. In a few steps, the phone was properly configured for my gmail account. However, in the future, using email as a representative example, I'd suggest Nokia put more effort to simplify/automate common tasks in the initial setup process, such as pairing with my bluetooth headset, or specifying predictive or non-predictive text entry.* Awkward Connection Management - Most of the built in applications have a choice to always connect to a specific WiFi/3G/Edge connection, or to always choose a connection during startup - Wouldn't it have been simpler to specify a prioritized list of connections to try, such as your home WiFi first, then 3G?* Lots of keyboard shortcuts - I'm still learning many of the keyboard shortcuts, such as pressing and holding the ""Home"" button to display a list of open applications, pressing and holding the email button to start a new email, or pressing and holding the calendar button to enter a new meeting. While there's a learning curve, I'm appreciating the added efficiency of these shortcuts.* Works well with iSync - Being a Mac user, I downloaded the iSync plugin. So far, I've found iSync does a job synchronizing the phone with my local iCal calendar and Mac address book.",11,4
Nokia,"I wanted to ""upgrade"" from my old N95 (had it 2 or 3 years)and get a phone with full qwerty keyboard. Using Nokia's ""Switch"" utility, all my contacts were transfered to my new E63 within minutes... It was effortless... Thank you Nokia!TV SCREEN: The E63 screen is brighter, wider and better proportioned than the N95. Great for watching TV - yes, there's a $15 TV application that gives you CNN and about 100 other channels - Google ""Spb TV""SPEED: It's much faster and more streamlined than the N95 - maybe the E63 has a faster processor?FAST CAMERA: REALLY FAST! It boots up in about one second so it's much easier to point and shoot than the N95. 2.0 Megapixels isn't a problem - I prefer the lower resolution because it's much easier to email and share the pics on the net.PRIUS BLUETOOTH INTEGRATION: Bluetooth transfered ALL my 170 contacts to the Toyota's Address Book in one shot. The N95 couldn't do that!INTERNET MODEM: Works flawlessly... Nokia PC Suite allows me to connect my notebook to the internet anytime by just plugging the phone into its USB port and clicking a button. T-Mobile gives me unlimited access to the Internet for just $20/month.BATTERY: E63's battery is huge - about twice the size of the N95's - without making the phone more bulky - amazing. The E63 easily lasts far longer than the N95 without re-charging.VOLUME CONTROL: There's no physical volume control buttons on the E63. Instead, you use the central cursor control (during a call) and it works just fine. Honestly, who actually alters the volume of each call? I set the volume once and it normally stays at that level for all my calls - I don't miss having a separate volume control. Good job NOKIA!GMAIL: Nokia's combined email/message application works better than Google's own separate Gmail application. Setup was easy and Nokia integrates a Gmail inbox alert into the phone's main screen.BLUETOOTH TIP: Quickly turn on/off Bluetooth by pressing and holding the asterisk key * for a couple of seconds (from the main screen). Great for when you're in the car with passengers but don't want them listening to your ""hands free"" conversations.PRICE: You just can't beat it - there's NOTHING that comes close. You'll also need to order a Nokia USB cable (about $2 on Amazon) and why not treat yourself to an 8GB Micro SDHC card? (about $20).NOKIA E63 ROCKS!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!!!!!",29,5
Nokia,"People, people...this is an amazing opportunity; move on it. This phone is an EU phone that is being offered here in the US to gain market share and put the phone in the hands of the more casual user. Go ahead, go to CNET and PCworld and check out the reviews; the E63 is typically compared with units costing 2-3 times as much. So, it falls a bit short in some areas (camera, headphones, et al) so, it's not perfect. For under $200, who cares? Come on. All current phones are obsolete in three years anyway, (or after the first drop on the airport floor)!The E63's got a vivid screen, great speaker, gets FM radio, a decent app store @ NOKIA.com, MicroSD slot, easy to sync up, great build quality and offers clear reception for TMobile, ATT and international travel, whenever we decide to do that again. QKeyboard, ability to netsurf in hotspots w/o dataplan, US WARRANTY and by the way, currently less than $150 beans with rebate. And no two-year contract. Yankee Blue or Sox Red, they easily stand out among the Crackberry drones. Wake up and smell the symbian, Baby...getting a great deal is the hot trend.",15,4
Nokia,"The product advertised clearly stated ""MADE IN FINALND"". Unfortunately, the product received was ""MADE IN CHINA"".I would like to return the product, however, I have received it thru my shop & ship account and sending it back would cost more.Do not buy this product. It is falsely advertised.",14,1
Nokia,"Update - 27th May 2012It has been a year plus of using this phone. I have been tempted to change to another phone but some things keep holding me back. Maybe I am just sentimental. Maybe it is regret that Nokia decided to prematurely abandon the platform, which is actually pretty good.But mostly I just loved the fact that I can tether it to my laptop to access the internet without paying extra smartphone tethering plan / jailbreak / etc.. (for some reason, some telco considered this phone a dumbphone - thus I can use the unlimited data plan for dumbphone. Which is cheaper. WIN!!)++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This is a good phone. But no gadget is perfect and I will go into the pros / cons. Hopefully this will help those who are on the fence to make up their mind.(Really, the Symbian / Nokia users need not much convincing and are already very aware of the phone; while the android / iOS fans will probably just stick with what they are comfortable with).First, I have been a Nokia / Symbian user for a long time. My wife has an iPhone; so I can appreciate both. Played a bit with android but did not spend too much time with it to give a fair opinion on it. On to the review:What about the Hardware?First, the hardware is very nice and is a major selling point. The OLED screen with 'Clear Black Display' really looks nice on the eye. If people are impressed with 'Retina Display' they should be equally impressed with E7 screen with the vivid color and unparalleled contrast. OLED also draws less power and have tricks with the sleeping screen (check Nokia Beta Labs - Sleeping Screen app).The form factor is another reason to consider E7. For those like me, who prefer a hardware keyboard... Let me say that the keyboard is one of the best. The slide mechanism is solid and impressive too.The GPS function can easily replace a dedicated unit out there. Especially since you can sideload map from all over the world free using the OVI Suite.USB on the Go, HDMI output, QuickOffice offer great flexibility in sharing / viewing / moving your files and media. The media / music player is an included standard feature as well.Do I need to mention that the E7 cover all the international variants of GSM / HSDPA frequency band? This means you can access 3G pretty much all around the world where they are available. (Most other phones cover all the GSM frequency variants but not HSDPA.)In a nutshell, the hardware is a solid five. Some may disagree on the camera though. Being a fixed focus with EDOF (Extended Depth of Field), you will not be able to take close up picture. This is a trade-off for the slimmer body. Still, the picture is usable (I suggest to change the color to vivid and use sharpest setting - the camera processing seems to produce a very subdued picture). You may want to check Nokia N8 if camera is more important to you than a hardware keyboard.What about the software?Symbian^3 is a major step up from the earlier version. Still, to really enjoy it, one has to actually go into it and learn the intricacies. So yes, it is not as intuitive (simple) as iOS. But some may actually prefer the flexibility that comes with this. Here is a couple of tips (things I always do when I get a fresh Symbian phone):- Give accompanying OVI suite a try (try the beta version.. it's faster). I mostly use it as an easy way to tether my laptop (yes sir, big reason why I love unlocked Nokia phone) but some of the other features are nice too.- Update all the firmware / apps.- Reorganize the icons into folder structure that make sense to you. It is a hassle the first time but will make a difference as to how you use the phone. (Option > Organize)- Play around with the setting. (Seriously..)- If you really have to have iOS style interface, you can customize multiple shortcut widgets on your 3 home screens. Frankly, I never see the need to do this.- The search widget is quite useful... but do go to the setting to exclude items that you don't want it to index.Here is a tip... touch and hold is like a mouse right click. It brings up context menu for many items in the phone.What about the apps?Sad to say, this is a major con when it comes to Symbian. If you come from Android / iOS, the first thing you will notice is actually the lack of it. This is especially a concern now since Nokia announcement to transition to Windows Mobile. It makes for less incentive for software developers to further develop apps for the platform.That said, thus far, I am still seeing new apps every now and then. And Symbian is feature rich enough that you don't necessarily miss them. Still, here are a couple apps you should get if you do get the phone.- Opera Mini / Mobile : Trust me, this will make your browsing experience much, much better. Nuff said. (also, please tinker with the setting.)- Swype : You don't really need it for this phone because of the hardware keyboard. But if you are lazy to flip it open.- Gravity : Facebook / Twitter client- JoikuSpot : turn your phone into mobile WiFi HotSpot.- Nokia Internet Radio / Tunewiki : Good for listening to Shoutcast radio.- Try out any of the apps from Nokia Beta Labs / Check out Ovi Store...- If you are adventurous, scour the net for various app out there in the net too (I typically go to allaboutsymbian.com for tips, etc)Frankly, there is not much essential apps to mention for now.. I do wish we have a kindle app for the phone (are you listening Amazon?). Maybe Evernote. And maybe more games too. Again, here is an area where I have to say that I envy my wife and her iPhone.What about the performance?So far, the phone is snappy enough. The only time it sometimes seems to freeze is when I am installing new apps (it will resume to normal if you leave it, I just feel apprehensive whenever that happens).So there you have it. The phone does have potentials. Whether it will meet your needs or not is another. I am done tinkering with my phone for now to make it works the way I want and am quite happy with it.",145,4
Nokia,"Apple made me part of the smartphone world with its iPhone (beside the no-fun Blackberry I had to use before), but this phone is just of another category. Just give the keyboard a try - the virtual iphone one is ""usable"", the tiny Blackberry keys are ""okay"", but the writing experience on the Nokia E7 is just amazing. The large tilting 4"" Oled screen gives you just the right angle of vision and stability, much better than that of undifferentiated mass of Chinese Android Qwerty sliders.Another killer function is the free offline GPS navegation. The iPhone doesn't have it (you have to buy TomTom or Navignon solutions which are good, but not cheap) and the Android phones consume megabytes from the data pack while navigating (and its turn by turn functionality is limited to North America). Nokia owns Navitech, so they are one of the technology leaders in this field - you really don't need a secondary GPS device any longer. The US comes preinstalled, and you can download from the device (no need to connect to a PC) any other map worldwide while you are still under fast and free Wifi coverage.Another important feature is that it is an open and truly international phone. I am traveling regularly to Europe and Latin America. Even an unblocked, jailbroken iPhone is not easy to adapt to different SIM card settings, but this one is a no brainer: slip in a local prepaid SIM card with an local data allowance (which is much easier and cheaper to buy in Europe and Latam as US carriers are still reserving competitive data packs to their contract customers) and voil?­ - the phone updates all settings automatically so you are online in a breeze at low costs, wherever you are. Additionally it is the only nine-band phone I know (5 3G bands, 4 GSM bands), so it works anywhere in the world with high 3G data speeds, guaranteed).Just one minor thing: I like reading news via RSS. The E7 can do that, but the functionality is buried in the menu of the web browser. Also, the contact management could be streamlined a bit, It works, but iOS has better implementations.In summary: after years of Blackberry and, more recently the iPhone, this Phone is the best solution for anybody who writes a lot (SMS, emails, notes, whatever - writing on this phone is MUCH faster produces less typing errors than any other phone I know), for anyone traveling abroad and for anybody who uses the phone as a car/bike/walk navigator. These functions are outstanding, the rest is OK.",11,5
Nokia,"I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who's had a Nokia epiphany with the E71 (some time ago) and a somewhat muted (at least, at first) yet ever-growing blast with the E72.Essentially, the jump from a non-touch ~2"" screen to a truly gorgeous 4"" AMOLED touch screen (and the wonderful freedom it allows for Symbian to finally let loose) is just short of life-changing, and thus, if you're making the leap into the touch screen arena for the first time, you can expect to be just as -- if not more -- blown away as I am now. For those of you who've been playing with touch screens for ages now, even I can admit (and, so far, a good number of iPhone and various Android users, too) that this screen's size and brilliance is definitely at or near the top.One more thing before I cover a few, select details: I had heard that Nokia's earlier ventures into the touch screen market didn't quite measure up to the fast, responsive, and flowy moves of iOS (e.g. N97, X6). This was a major worry, because I just couldn't imagine anything worse than being stuck with a physical button-less screen that jolted and froze as I poked around the Symbian interface. However, due to the difficulty in finding independent retailers that had any of the newest models of touch screen Nokias available for demos, I took a very cautious step out, bought the E7, and was most pleasantly surprised! It's a breeze, and even after the wonder of the screen's beauty wares off, the sensitivity, responsiveness, and class (yes, it's classy) will continue to make you ponder how Nokia's E7 could possibly still even have one of the best mobile keyboards ever built!! It's overwhelming...Now, time to be short and sweet and name just a few ups and downs:- The fact that Nokia managed to squeeze the keyboard and screen into a mobile device whose hardware (as usual) is impeccable and truly some of the best Nokia's ever put together (which is saying something, trust me), and whose form factor is as fresh, slim, and eye-catching as a concept phone that's come out 6 months too early, is just unheard of in today's somewhat mundane mobile marketplace. And plus, the whole brick-like ""communicator"" style seemed to be out, but now Nokia has given it more than enough new and improved life to make the E7 also an incredibly unique piece. Tired of having to come up with new tricks and apps (what is that one.. Swype?) to type on a virtual, touch keyboard...and dealing with an unfortunately steep learning curve (which many times doesn't have a top)? Well, why don't I just pop up my screen to this curiously comfortable 30 degree angle and type on a real keyboard! How refreshing...- As always, phone's tend to seem they could use a bit more power. And, like any phone, I wouldn't complain if there was just a little more kick here as well. It's fast, but you'll notice just the tiniest inkling of lag when you're installing new programs (and, ofcourse, new software updates and whatnot, as mentioned by another reviewer here). I have to admit -- being used to Symbian -- I have become patient and understanding when my phones have seemed to freeze for a second or two when introducing new software to them, but it's not the end of the world.- Now that Nokia's officially jumping ship (or ""platform""....) to Microsoft's mobile OS, one would (reasonably) assume that Symbian's essentially dead in the water. This idea went through my head for a second, but I've put it behind me. First of all, I think Nokia's done a really good job with Symbian^3, and considering that I've only come onboard a few months after the E7's release, there've been a good handful of serious software updates, and I have had nearly zero problems at all with the OS thus far (with only a minor problem installing some updates to Ovi maps and the Symbian search: they'd download, but would continue to fail in installation...but nothing a restart of the phone couldn't fix ... which tends to be an easy and simple fix for most things when it comes to Symbian). Therefore, I have a good feeling that this switch to Microsoft's WP7 will not be much of a problem at all (considering the following Nokia has in the Symbian world), at least, not as much as what it will probably bring to the OviStore (which is also debatable). **UPDATE: Symbian ""Anna"" will be available for the E7, sometime soon (as of April '11)**- Also about Symbian: for those of you who know the OS, I think Symbian^3 on the E7 will be a lot of fun; although I'm definitely used to the ins and outs (however, I'm surely not a pro), I still had to do a little internet research for the usual hidden tips and tricks, and some basic how-to. Those who know Symbian will know what I'm talking about. Symbian isn't about dumbing things down so that everything is as clear as day (and simultaneously taking the customization and uniqueness to the chopping block). There is no one place for all your phone's preferences, for instance. So if you can't find how to change something, don't give up. It's part of the fun and once you figure it out, it'll slowly all make sense, and a wonderful map of a world known as Symbian^3 will slowly form into a coherent, simple, straight-forward and truly logical OS.I'm still discovering plenty on the E7, and I'm still doing double takes at it's distinctive elegance, refinement, and true artistry, as it sits on my table with it's slightly tilted, thin, brilliant face looking up at me over a streamlined keyboard and award-worthy body. If you have yet to jump into the world of Nokia, this is the top of the top and one hell of a place to dive in. For those of you who have anything at the level of an E72 and below (essentially anything but the N8, C7, and, perhaps, the C6), this is definitely a worthwhile upgrade.I'll be back with some pointers!",21,5
Nokia,"I rarely write reviews, especially for products that majority of people know they are good products. Nokia, though losing marketshare slowly, is still a big player and with many tricks up its sleeve. The fact that they design a phone for the end users not the networks, is what keeps it a good phone in terms of customization and controls (privacy, tracking, sharing location, etc).The phone is very slick in terms of being a business phone, a bit bulky..but even with forced feedback touch screen, I still have a hard time using the touch screen to type..even on my wife's iPhone..and the iPad...I guess our ability to sense touch compared to sound is better..so I prefer forced feedback (tiny vibration to let you know you are touching the screen as you type). So bulky...but that's the beauty..it has a QWERTY keyboard with Ctrl+V+X+C functions (copying and pasting stuff for documents, emails, etc).People complaining about the Ovi app store not having enough apps compared to App Store or Droid Market? Well...all of them offer crap apps anyway..so you won't be disappointed. If you like crappy free apps, or to pay a premium for ""better ones -aka no ads"" then buy a an iPhone, or Android phone.If you like functionality, business use and ability to still have some fun with your phone...buy this phone. Great camera (no auto focus....but if you need details up close...buy a real camera). 8MP, HDMI out, 720p video recorder, micro USB to connect memory stick, office suite (full)....plays all kinds of audio/video formats, it has full version flash (unlike iPhone..who push people to develop apps to display ads..not through flash on sites).The phone itself has many built in security software and other software to keep you buys before buying any apps (tracking, security, locking, etc)Overall...if you remember the communicator (great business phone), this is definitely 100% improvement. And get the Otterbox case for it...you don't want to scratch it:) Apple and droid have great marketing skills and presentation...but Nokia steals the show....their Symbian OS will be replaced by Windows mobile soon..I am not looking forward to use Ctrl+Alt+Del to login to the phone, but it's not a bad mobile OS.",13,5

Nokia,"Some notes to consider for this phone:3G -- Despite Amazon saying this is the US Version of the phone (which it is,) this phone does NOT work with T-mobile 3G in the US. T-Mobile 3G in the US uses the 1700 mhz spectrum (you can read on wikipedia as for the reasons why) and there are no 3G roaming agreements with AT&Ts 3G spectrum like there is with EDGE. That being said, I have found that EDGE is fast enough for my web browsing and e-mail use (220 kbps+.) Using GSM/EDGE only also more than doubles your battery life, so this is not an entirely bad thing for T-Mobile users. The 10 hours talk-time and 17 day standby is no joke with GSM either.Network Settings -- Nokia has a great website that will text you all the internet, voicemail, and MMS settings for your carrier to the unlocked phone.Bluetooth Tethering -- This phone does not tether with Mac OS 10.4 Tiger. It does tether perfectly with 10.5 Leopard. It tethers with Windows XP via included Nokia PC Suite. It would be nice if a Mac suite were included from Nokia but Apple provides everything necessary with Leopard. It obviously tethers perfectly with Nokia N800/N810.GPS -- The GPS in the phone is first class with both an actual GPS receiver and assisted GPS through cell tower. It works much better than my TomTom One especially indoors. The phone comes with a great program called Maps but the only drawback (and it is a HUGE drawback) is that you have to pay a monthly fee to use any sort of route guidance. You're allowed to see your position and browse maps for free but if you want to plan a route it costs extra. It comes with a 7 day trial that you should save for emergencies in my opinion.Networks in General -- This phone works great on both AT&T and T-Mobile but each has their drawbacks. AT&T has the faster network but limits you to 5Gb/month bandwidth and charges extra to tether. T-Mobile allows actual unlimited data on EDGE and allows free tethering to any device but has the slower ""2.75G"" EDGE data network. Wifi is available on the phone and works flawlessly.Third Party Apps -- Two must have apps are the S60 Divx player and the Slick IM client (AIM, Jabber, Etc.) The Nokia mail client works great and a third party solution is not necessary.All in all this is a first class phone whose only missing feature is a touch screen. Depending on your need for a QWERTY keyboard I would say this and the N95 are battling it out for best phone in the world right now.",126,5
Nokia,"I bought this phone as my first smart phone ever. I love it! To say the least.

Nokia,"First a little background - I bought this Nokia E71-2 from Amazon after a not so positive experience using Apple iPhone (first generation) and Blackberry Bold. I needed an all purpose phone for use in corporate (read that as Microsoft Exchange) environment.While I found the iPhone to be otherwise great, I had some major issues with it - Lack of real Keyboard just does not work well for lots of email/sms typing. Next the Exchange support was too late, too little (Exchange Account did not work for me ever and Calendar/Reminders was a problem when using Exchange over IMAP), Battery life was unbearably bad, and lastly the iPhone did not support Bluetooth stereo headphones.So I tried Blackberry Bold - only to find out that the browser on it was not anywhere near as good as the iPhone but the real problem was that it needed a BlackBerry Data plan before it could do anything - no mails, no Internet even when connected to Wi-Fi - and my corporate data plan does not include BlackBerry Data Plan - Bummer!Enter Nokia E71 - I am happy to report it has solved all my problems. The browser on this phone is based on the same WebKit engine that Apple uses in Mobile Safari. I found website compatibility to be excellent. Most importantly however, it comes with Flash! Most flash sites work well - but not all, as this is a Flash lite version. There is also a Youtube client freely available that works amazingly well.Battery life on this phone is really great compared to the iPhone or any other smart phone - I can easily get through a heavy-use day (3G calling, Some music over bluetooth, Always on Exchange Sync) and even go for another day with lighter use.If you use Exchange for email - you will find the E71 does Exchange very well. Setup was very straight forward, I could customize the sync schedule to be always on during working hours and every 1 hour off-peak. The newest version of the Nokia Mail for Exchange Application is very stable and functional. It includes a Company Directory Client which lets you quickly search for your colleagues to find their email/phone information. Meeting reminders work very well - Exchange server calendar is synced to your phone and so all your meeting reminders are available right on the home screen - very convenient. It also supports regular GMail over IMAP.The real keyboard on this thin little phone is very usable - you almost want to keep typing! I rarely mistype. There is auto completion which works OK for most part and is actually useful.Call quality is great - very rarely I had dropped calls, but they were due to ""Network Busy"" errors on AT&T's part and happened after 2 hours of talk - so I can't really blame the phone for it.Media - The phone continues to do great on this front. I was able to pop in my 4Gb micro SD card to make enough space for all my music and podcasts. It plays MP3s/AAC and most other routinely used formats. All of your music is available automatically for setting as ring tones or other tones (reminders/alarm etc.). It has a very functional Podcast client built-in - I was able to subscribe to all of my favorite podcasts and it automatically updated/downloaded the episodes as and when they became available. Stereo bluetooth support is great - it allows to listen to music or podcasts while driving or while in the Gym. This was the only phone that played lots of music over bluetooth without crashing.The camera on this phone is 3.2MP and so it produces better quality pictures but I found a blue hue on the pictures initially - that was fixed with the latest software update from Nokia and now the pictures are great.Speaking of which - if you buy one, do yourself a favor and download the Nokia PC Suite Application (Windows only -works with Vista/x64) and run the phone software update before using the phone. This way you will get all the bug fixes and enhancements for the Phone without losing any data or setup. This is one area I wish Nokia improved - the upgrade process does not automatically preserve your data/settings/applications that are on your phone (as opposed to on the MicroSD card) - it should just put your phone back where it was before the upgrade and do it all automatically.Lastly the GPS - it works well. It was able to connect to the satellites and determine my position even indoors! Download the Google Maps application for free and you have a very usable GPS.If you are OK with having this phone locked down to AT&T network for a 2yr contract - I have heard that AT&T is bringing a later version of this phone for under $100 - so keep an eye.",21,5
Nokia,"I've been searching for a solid business smart phone for some time. The key criteria was first and foremost solid phone reception in an area that can have spotty coverage due to many hills plus strong battery life. I also needed solid syncing capability to my work calendar (Oracle Calendar), a very strong web browsing experience, and well designed contacts and call management. I must say that the Nokia e71 has excelled in each of these areas and the battery life is amazing (2 days solid with no charging). The main screen (Home Screen) is very well designed and more customizable than any other smart phone I have seen including the iPhone (which I also like very much). The extent to which this phone and its menu options can be tailored to meet your unique needs is impressive. The keyboard is small but eminently usable and the weight and thinness of this phone is incredible. This is one phone that I carry in a pouch in my pocket and not on my belt -- which is a first. The speaker phone is very decent ... not as strong as a Blackberry I used previously ... but respectful. And the call clarity and reception is a major plus for this phone. I loved my iPhone but dropped calls more than I would have preferred. Not so with this phone ... I've gotten consistently good reception. The included web browser is very usable and Opera Mini is also excellent (a free download). The email client on this phone -- which I use for IMAP4 -- is decent but I find it can occasionally be slow in updating or syncing with my corporate e-mail. Also, the calendar sync works well, but there is no auto-sync capability (you have to initiate the sync directly although that's easily done). Not a deal killer for me, but the email functionality needs some further refinement (perhaps a firmware update is coming on this one) and Nokia really does need to add an autosync feature for the syncml client so it can for example run once in the morning and once in the evening without user intervention to keep your phone's calendar in sync with the office. But in the end, there is no perfect smart phone ... but this seems to me to be one of the most solid one's out there based on my own extensive research and hands on testing. Excellent build quality, very rich functionality, and a reliable phone connection. I'm well satisfied. Nokia seems to have a winner here and if you have a Mac, the sync support to the Mac platform is an added plus. Good luck in your search for the perfect phone!",19,5
Nokia,"With one word: NO.After owning and E71 for over a year, which for me was by far the best phone that I have ever used, I was really excited about getting the new E72 since it featured a 600Mhz CPU which seemed to be my main and only issue with the E71. However the CPU was the only upgrade in this unit and almost everything else seemed to be in fact a downgrade. As mentioned by another reviewer this phone has serious stability issues. The FP2 OS is extremely buggy and crashes, reboots and freezes several times a day. Nokia really needs to work on a new firmware to correct this. Below is every quality of the phone that I could think of as compared to the E71.HARDWARE-----------------------------BUILD QUALITY: Definitely not as solid of a feeling compared to the mostly metal E71. The D-pad feels like cheap plastic and it has some free play. The back cover tends to move occasionally when you are holding the phone to your ear.SPEAKERPHONE: Very poor quality compared to the E71. There is very noticeable buzzing near the maximum volume, even with high quality music files. Calls on speakerphone at max volume are plain annoying due to the buzzing. On top of that the speaker is not as loud as the one on the E71.CALL QUALITY: Excellent call quality except at the maximum volume where the call speaker also becomes distorted.KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD: The keyboard feels slightly better than the one on the E71. The buttons seem to give out somewhat of a better feedback. However the E72 is slightly wider than the E71 which makes it a little harder to type on with one hand. The new track pad navigation provides a very inconsistent performance and it is not even close to the one on the newer blackberries. Scrolling up and down is perfectly fine but scrolling sideways becomes an exercise. The good news is that the original directional pad like on the E71 is still there so you can just disable the touchpad if you hate it just as much as I did after a week of usage.CAMERA: It is still a cell phone camera so keep your expectations low. It takes decent pictures and the quality is about the same as the E71 but with 5 megapixel images and slightly wider lens. The camera application now has built-in panorama mode. Video at 640x480 is plain horrible. The flash on this phone is actually pretty decent. One thing that was very annoying to me is that it uses a very bright focus light(AKA The flash) which makes focusing at macro impossible if you are trying to take a picture of something with brighter colors that reflect more light. There is no way to disable the focus light either, not even in macro mode. Nokia should think about this as well.BATTERY LIFE: There is simply nothing like it. Except the E71. The battery life on the E72 is also exceptional. I am able to get 2 to 3 days of very heavy usage on it, including 2 to 3 hours of talking, 2 hours of browsing and some text messaging. I have not seen any other phone in this category which gets even close to these stats.GPS: Works great and it gets a position fix generally within 5 seconds. It seems a little faster than the E71. The E72 also has a compass.SOFTWARE-------------------------This is the bad part.FP2: Aside from unifying various internet connections I really did not see much if any of an improvement in this version of the Symbian OS. In fact it features some ugly menu transitions and it has a lot of stability issues. You would get out of memory error with a subsequent freezing at least a couple of times in a day and reboots and total freezes which require battery removal are not uncommon either.APPLICATION UNLOCK: Yes, the phone is hackable with HelloOX 2 and up.WEB BROWSER: The browser is definitely improved from the E71 afar as rendering and navigation goes. However I was never able to complete even ONE single browsing session without this thing crashing and just exiting in the middle of something. It would have been great if it did not crash.E-MAIL: About as bad as the client available on my first T-Mobile Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 2002. Although that one was a little better than what Nokia has provided. It is almost 2010 and Nokia still does not have an e-mail client which supports in-line HTML. The Nokia messaging software and service is plain horrible. After 3 days of usage I just cancelled my account and went to using webmail. It is really that bad and this is unacceptable for a supposed ""business"" device. As an alternative, I would recommend Emoze. Their software even partially supports in-line HTML. If you have Hotmail, you can download Windows Live for Symbian. It works really well.PODCASTING & INTERNET RADIO: Missing!!!???! Very disappointing.SIP CLIENT: Missing!!! The SIP settings are there, but there is no client. So forget about gizmo or any similar service unless you are using a third party client like Nimbuzz or Fring.OFFICE APPLICATIONS: This is one positive category. Quickoffice features a free upgrade to open and edit Office 2007 documents. Nokia has also added Wpresenter, Multiscanner and Font Magnifier as standard applications.--------------------Overall the E72 is a mixed bag for me. It delivers on speed and the browser is well improved but the stability issues, missing software and some other quirks make this device seem like a downgrade. If I was aware of these issues it is likely that I would have stayed with the E71. So if you are in doubt, my advice would be save your money or at least wait for a firmware update which fixes the stability issues. I hope this was helpful.",146,2
Nokia,"I upgraded from a Nokia E71 (which was an unbelievable upgrade from my previous experiences with Blackberry), and for some reason I was expecting that same leap from the E71 to E72. However, I soon realized, after using my E72 for the past couple days, that the E71 did in fact spoil me. The E72 is still no doubt an amazing phone -- along with the E71 and other top Nokias, it's still in its own little league above the Blackberries and other smartphones -- but I'll admit I was slightly let down.If you are looking to buy a Nokia (or any phone) I'd definitely recommend the E72. If you are a huge Nokia fan, then fine, upgrade. If you're happy with your E71....then I'd really think about it (or at least get your hands on one in person). The E72 is much faster, the camera's awesome, and it's still a beautiful phone. BUT you should know a couple things:-The construction is not quite as top-notch as the E71. It's a little lighter, with some metal replaced for a sort of heavy, hardened plastic. I've heard of the battery panel being loose, but I haven't run into the problem. Mine was made in China, while my E71 was made in Finland, although it seems there can always be problems no matter where it's made.-The optical pad is a nice touch (it takes some getting used to) and, occasionally, it can misinterpret your choice to click to the side for a sliding movement. But overall I'm getting used to it (and if you really don't like it you can always switch it off).-I do notice the slightest high pitched buzz when the volume is turned up and the sound coming from the other end of the call is on the loud side. The E71 never had this problem. I take it the speakers were either downgraded or because of the extra plastic there's some sort of vibration (could just be my model). UPDATE: Seems the speaker just needed some ""breaking in"" (strange, I know). This problem is no longer present. However, still not the best volume in speakerphone mode.***Overall, I'd say if you're looking at the E72 compared to any top smartphone, this is an excellent choice***IF you're looking at the E72 and E71 side by side, it is THEN that you start to notice the little details that I mentioned above. True, there are a few more plastic pieces than the E71, but when I think about the Blackberries and iPhones, you're never going to get the same quality you got with the E71, and the E72 is just a notch below that.E72 is a 4.5 star phone. E71 will always be the best phone I've ever owned.",128,4
Nokia,"I suspect that guys giving 5 stars are getting paid money which should have gone into development and testing instead.I have had E65, E71 before this and like others here have been waiting for this half a year.I was not expecting much .. just a bit faster version of E71.Sp far I am amazed that they allow this to to pass quality testingHere are main issues:1) Psiloc World Traveler - if you are new owner don't touch it !! Once you configure it there is no getting rid of it. Since it is preinstalled you can't even uninstall it. So it keeps bugging me to connect to internet even when I am roaming.2) Truphone does not work with E72. This was my favorite VOIP application which I was able to use worldwide from any hotspot and call to my contacts directly. Entire VOIP integration is screwed up and you have to download it separately.3) No Podcasts. I was so used to download my favorite radio programms and listen to them on plane. So now I struggle with Escarpod.4) Browser is marginally better at rendering pages but crashes every session.Good stuff:1) Hotmail, Yahoo and Gmail connections seem to be more stable. On E71 they were getting stuck at times2) Camera is better3) Google Maps work4) Fring works5) Call quality is good",10,2
Nokia,"Coming from a Windows mobile phone (HTC tilt), I love this phone. I have been considering the Tilt2, but wanted to try something other than a WinMo (I didn't find myself using a lot of WinMo features/apps that called for another similar one). iPhone was out of question as I wanted tethering, better battery life and dedicated keyboard. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and liking it more day by day. Few things before moving to Pros and Cons of the phone - This phone is not for people that like simplicity of touch screen phones (like iPhone). There is a learning curve in using this phone's features and the shortcut keys. But, imo once familiar with the functions/shortcuts one can do things a lot faster than a touch screen phone.Pros****1. Looks sleek and professional. Call quality is excellent and plenty loud.2. Keyboard feels very good even though the keys are slightly smaller. They have a nice feedback when pressed.3. Shortcut keys! There are quite a few shortcut keys on QWERTY keyboard to control phone functions and inside applications. While this feature has a learning curve, I found it very useful once learned.4. Snappy performance. Very fast and responsive.5. OVI MAPS for Free! - this is simply awesome. Now you can have a GPS with maps for as many countries as you need, for free!. Below is a mini review for this feature to explain it better. a. The GPS locks on the position very fast while using A-GPS. Most of the time within 10-15 sec I have a lock on the signal. b. GPS interface is very good and user friendly (I have used the latest Garmin and Magellan). c. Features include lane assistance, auto zoom in/out based on turns/directions, voice guidance, Speedometer, 2D/3D maps, route overview etc. d. The map size while getting driving direction is a bit smaller on E72, due to smaller screen. Pretty much only 2x2 inch space is used to show the map and rest is used for other information. It might look better on Nokias with larger touch screens. In spite of this, the auto zoom in/out makes it easier to view the map details. e. I compared it side by side with my Magellan and found it to be pretty accurate. E72 was faster in getting the signals (perhaps due to A-GPS)6. Wifi - Works wonderfully and connects to my home network with WPA2 security without any problems. Once connected, I can turn off scanning to save battery Life7. Screen is very bright and readable in direct sunlight.8. Battery life - I can wait for 3 days (may be 4 if I wait for the phone to die on me) before I have to connect it to charger. I use Push emails (18 hrs a day) and stay connected to my home wireless network most of the time and occasional use of phone for talking. Even with heavy use I expect it to last at least for 2 days.9. 3.5mm headphone jack10. Comes with a 4GB micro SD card.11. Decent 5MP camera and nice outdoor photo quality. Indoor photos are just OK (most cellphone cameras are the same).Cons****1. Screen resolution is not great when compared other similar type phones (E.g. Blackberry bold). Would have been nice to have higher resolution on such a bright screen2. Speaker phone volume is not loud enough3. Mail for Exchange - The version on phone is not bad, but it could be better. This is the only application that runs slow on this phone. It takes good few secs for it to open a mail. As it does not load the mail in HTML format automatically, the readability suffers. I had to scroll 2-3 pages to read a few liner mails. Got Roadsync (version 5) for discounted price from OVI store and loving it. It addresses all the problems with Mail for Exchange.4. Optical trackpad is not very useful (even after setting sensitivity to high). I found using the D-pad quicker.5. Micro USB connector and shortest cable - the USB cable that came in the box is approx 7inch long. For such highly priced phone it would have been nice if Nokia included a good quality longer cable. Also, I would have preferred a Mini USB instead of Micro. Micro USB feels a bit fragile and I feel like I might break it if I'm a bit careless when connecting. Perhaps, the thinner case was a limitation to include a mini USB.The phone crashed only once till date and that was when using the Mail for Exchange. I blame it on the application for the crash and not the S60 platform. Browsing experience is not as great a touch screen phone/phone with larger screen. But, there is always a compromise on size vs. features.",10,5

Nokia,"A little background first. I have used Nokia phones since 1998 and found them reliable and virtually indestructible. I decided to move to a smartphone, no Nokia models were available. My first smartphone ran winmo. It would constantly freeze up and battery life was horrible. I then got a Palm Centro and loved it! It had it's own problems (would reboot randomly and the build quality wasn't great) but overall it was a good little phone. After about 17 months it failed and I couldn't upgrade using my plan. I purchased a unlocked Nokia E63 and was back in the Nokia fold. Build quality was great. When the E72 was announced I decided to go for it. The first reviews from the blogs and tech sites were glowing so I felt good about ordering it. Then the user reviews started....Build quality problems and the ""made in China"" complaints made me doubt my decision. Along with other problems.... I received my E72 a little over a month ago and was disappointed in the build quality, especially the loose battery cover. In fact, I went to check out the Blackberry Bold 9700 which was on sale for $89 (after rebate)at Best Buy Mobile. I wasn't impressed with it's build quality either though. Also I was afraid of the AT&T cripple ware that would probably be installed. So I decided to give the E72 a try. I installed my sim and booted up. Push email installed flawlessly and worked great. I suffered none of the problems other users were reporting. I figured I had lucked out and had gotten a ""good"" one. After a week the loose battery cover settled in and while still not a perfect fit,it was no longer loose. Then week 3 happened...The first problem occurred while attempting to place a call. The phone would let me dial a number but the call would not complete. Of course I figured it was the (AT&T) network. I then realized I couldn't send text messages either. I did a ""soft"" reboot and that fixed the problem. A couple of days later, I got the dreaded ""space bar doesn't work"" problem. Again, a soft reboot fixed this problem. The next day while using the browser, the phone rebooted on its own. Today I got the ""buzzing/squeal"" problem while talking. Yet again, a restart solved the problem.In my opinion for what it's worth, I think Nokia released this phone in time for the holiday season without the proper quality control. All of these problems can be fixed by a firmware update. The N900 got one today so hopefully the E72 will receive one soon.I apologize for the long winded review. Flame on?",11,4
Nokia,#N/A,23,1
Nokia,"I have had the phone for over 24 hours so far. Great phone. Good sound, good voice, fast O.S. Good signal reception all around, though in N. NJ that is not really a problem.I charged it initially at home with the included AC charger, and at the office hooked it up with the included USB cable and saw the phone charging while I was playing with it and synching up my calendar.I swapped my SIM card from the old phone, (HTC Hermes/ATT 8525), to this one and it worked right away. ATT mediaNet needed no configuration even though I had only added data/texting to my account from online only minutes before. WiFi works well in my home. This is my first time using ATT MediaNet so I can't really comment, but it helped me compare prices on a microwave oven from inside a store. Amazon got an order for a microwave once I got home and I saved over $50. It is nice not hunting for a WiFi signal as I used to do. Glad I finally succumbed to paying for ATT's service. I am not comfortable with Nokias included browser yet, but it seems to work well. I may try Opera.I can work with office documents and synch up with my outlook calender faster than I could with my old HTC/ATT Win 6.1 smart phone. Nokia PC Suit is leagues ahead of MS Active Synch, and puts Motorola's software to the shame it deserves.Folks that play with it are amazed at how fast the phone responds when selecting applications. Instant response instead of a second or so wait as many Windows based phones have.The one issue I have had is I can not get the included headset to work properly as a headset. I suspect it is intended as just a music headset, but no matter what I do I can not get loud enough sound out of it, and the manual has no mention of it other than showing where to plug it in. When you attach the headset the phone asks what you want to use it as. Whether I select headset or headphones it does not seem to work well. The phone will warn you to use the phone mic. I recommend getting a better headset/headphones when you buy the phone, I am doing that right after I post this. Maybe with more use I can sort it out. I only tested it by calling my office voice mail, since I did not want to annoy friends and family by making them guinea pigs.This brings up the 3.5 mm jack the phone has. I am often on support calls. Sometimes for hours at a time. (Yes, I am an I.T. peon). I did not consider this when thinking about the phone, but there are NO standard headsets that use 3.5 jacks that I can find, they almost all use 2.5. The headsets that do use 3.5 are either iPhone style earbuds, which I find very uncomfortable, or ones intended for PC gaming, which use TWO plugs and are not usable on a phone. Not an over-the-ear one in the bunch. So I am stuck using bluetooth, which loses power fast and can't last long anough, or getting a clunky adapter so I can use a standard 2.5 mm headset, or trying an iphone earbud style headset that has the microphone in the wire, not on a boom, which has poor voice quality compared to a boom and hurts my ears after a few minutes. Slightly disappointing.I do like having the hidden qwerty keyboard, as I did with my prior phone, so that it is there when needed for documents, email, texting etc, but out of the way otherwise. Someday I may try a tablet-style phone, like the E71 or a blackberry, but this works well for me.One big reason I got this phone is the number pad for dialing. While touch screens are nice, having them as the only interface to the phone is a mistake.If you need to dial a number fast, such as 911, it can be very tough to do. Number pads are better, and if the primary use of the phone is as, well, a PHONE, it makes sense. It fits easily into my shirt pocket. I do not need to hang it on my belt and feel like Batman as I would with a tablet PDA.But touch screens are useful. I think this phone would benefit from one for navigating the menus, it would probably be faster than using the various keys. The screen could be larger, there would be room to extend it if Nokia moved the logo from the top of the phone.There is a lot left to play with on this, like the multiple profiles, etc. So there is still more to learn on this.But all-in-all, even with the headset issue, this is the best phone I have had yet, whether smart-phone or not. If this is an indication of where Nokia is going, they are going in the right direction.",26,5
Nokia,"All I can say is WOW!! I am totally impressed with it and believed that Nokia has come up with a winning product. I just owned this baby for less than a week but has already become addicted to it. Prior to buying e75, I have done research on various high-end phones on iphone, blackberrry, sony and even various other Nokia E-series and N-series phones and have also read almost all existing E75 cell-phone reviews on the web. Though there are mixed reviews on it, I decided to take the plunge and purchased it. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. It is definitely one of my best investments for the year, can't say the same for my other investments I have made :)===PROS1)Great great looks. stunning design. It is a really beautiful phone. I really liked a candy shaped smartphone that looks like a regular cellphone. Most of the powerful highend smartphone are much wider and have a bulky look. e75 has great dimensions and could easily fit inside a jeans pocket. great! The slide-out full-sized qwerty keypad is simply addictive! it is very easy to use, good-sized keys, slider makes a solid ""thud"" when opening and closing. amazing style and quality. love it!2)Amazing usability. In the first day, I already set up my email accounts(in a few simple clicks), browse the web, listening to both FM and internet radio, subscribe to podcasts, view office documents, download some latest apps from Nokia ovi store and use GPS as a tour guide. it is just so intuitive that I doubt you will need the guidebook and web reviews to guide you through using *any* features.3)Great build quality. It has a nice weight on it and feels like you are definitely holding something ""substantial"". I read about various people getting leaky keypad and such. No such issue with mine. As I said before, the sliding keypad feels very solid and snapping back and forth feels very secure with no loose ends. The silver-black and chrome combination makes e75 looks very upscale and all the keys are well-placed and very responsive. Some people are complaining about screen-size too small, qwerty layout hard to adjust etc. I find the screen size very sufficient to read email, browse documents and web. It is extremely sharp and is readable under bright sunlight and qwerty keypad works great. Can type out a long email in no time. Besides it also have a set of regular keys in front so you could do one-hand messaging as well. perfect!4)Good offering of applications. Web and office documents browsing and editing, great media player, easy to use GPS system makes it a fun-filled power business smartphone. A word about audio quality. The loudspeaker may not be as loud as someone likes but it is no worse than the samsung and motorola that I used to own. Call quality is superb. Reception is very good.===CONS1)Well, someone can quip about screen being too small, camera not being 5MP, screen not being the sharpest around, symbian too outdated, audio quality subpar, no touchscreen etc etc. but the ONLY complain that I think is valid and a very serious concern is the extensibility which may be what is stopping iphone users from crossing over. blame it on the App Store. Iphone is amazing not only because of its physical form and touch screen intuitiveness but on its amazing array of 3rd party applications. Sad to say, Nokia much touted ovi-store where we could purchase applications fall short, WAY short. I have browsed around for further-addon apps, very less offering and many are not free. well, even if they are free, i am not so sure i wanted them on. Don't even get me started on their Ngame platform. The games offering is simply pathetic. This lack of extensibility maybe crippling Nokia in the future where customers are very savvy and demanding and they want cellphones that have a long lifecycle and full of applications of anything imaginable not just what is offered by the manufacturer.2)A quick word about battery life. It really is pretty lousy, just as stated by various e75 review articles. You do need to charge it daily.3)I hate to state the obvious but the price tag is pretty hefty considering it didn't really offer any earth-shattering features that are not currently on the market or any out-of-the-world design.All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase. As long as you are aware of the limiting factors, e75 is an extremely well-rounded smartphone with great style and substance. Nokia E75 is everything that a business person would want and need plus much more.** I recently run into a refresh bug where my screen keeps on refreshing itself indefinitely. You may trigger this bug when your phone is running out of battery, and while recharging, you press on your email icon. I think the auto-syncing of email go crazy when dealing with this particular usecase. You don't have to send the phone back to manufacturer or even reset your phone, there is a nifty solution where you just have to press Control Panel->Settings->General->Personalization->HomeScreenMode->ModeSettings->Email Notifications->Disable then restart your phone. Your beloved phone will be functioning again. Hope that helps!",13,5
Nokia,"I upgraded to an E90 after 1.5 years using a Nokia 9300 to it's limits.My impression is that they made a list of every single complaint I had about the 9300 and addressed each of them! It's a fantastic cell phone and I love it.- on the 9300 I didn't even bother looking at the outside S40 screen, I opened it each time even to place a call; with the E90, switching seamlessly from screen to screen just by opening and closing the phone, I find myself using the outside screen more and more, I even T9 type text in the numeric keypad!... the outside screen is great for one hand operation, great not to call too much attention to a full qwerty phone when I don't want to and great for the casual email read... I think if I didn't have the option of switching to the internal big and high-resolution screen I'd find myself cursing the QVGA outside screen, but knowing I have the option of a big screen at any time makes me more tolerant to the smaller resolution outside screen and I use it a lot- the keyboard back-light is something you don't use all the time but when you do you realize how incredibly great it is- the inside screen, with even higher resolution than on the 9300 is absolutely great- the keyboard could be a little softer but the truth is that I find myself making less typing mistakes than with the 9300; the new layout is much better and the ""joystick"" much more precise- vibrating alert is great but I miss the timed mode that makes it come back to the ringing General profile at a specified time- the camera could have an optical zoom but it's good enough like it is... 640*480 30fps video is great- sound recording and playback has very good quality- the interface to the WiFi interface and to the GPRS/EDGE/3G APNs is great and makes me confident I'm in control of what is being used or not, unlike some complaints I heard with WM6 that you suddenly find yourself using EDGE when you wanted wifi, etc- the GPS and Nokia Maps is awesome but I also use Google Maps a lot with it- firmware/software upgrade through PC Suite is a blessing- I had a 9300 (no WiFi) and an unlimited data plan, I find myself using GPRS (or EDGE or 3G) data much more often than WiFi in the E90 but in some situations, specially when you are away from your country and GPRS data is expensive, Wifi is very much welcome- the 9300 Internet browser was a joke... very slow! when I found Opera Mini for it I never looked back to the internal browser; on the E90 the internal browser is very good, and the ability to play Flash and even YouTube video is very interestingThe single complaint I have about it is that it's S60 and not S80... the larger availability of software is welcome but I miss having a menu, I miss having more qwerty keyboard shortcuts, I miss the more elaborate S80 Calendar application...Not S60/S80 related:The few keyboard shortcuts it has are totally undocumented, I can't understand why.Another complaint is the lack of a ""open new window"" command on the Internet browser... it does that when you click a link that instructs is to open a new window, but this command is not in the browser interface! I'd also like the Back command not to reload the page... would make it faster!Last point: don't make the mistake of buying this phone and using a limited or expensive data plan, you'll be missing a lot!",10,5
Nokia,"I would like to give the phone a 5star rating (which I do personally), however the description of the phone in question shows that it works on US LTE bands and it doesn't. So while the phone itself gets a 5 star the seller (FSG) is causing the 3 star rating.Unfortunately it looks as if the description for this phone on the website is a mish-mash of the RM-875 and the RM-877. I discovered the RM differences after having to do research trying to resolve the LTE connection issue. I purchased the phone based on the description itself. All the initial research I had done was about the quality of the phone. I had not come across any review that spoke about the differences between the RM versions. The RM-875 does not work on LTE Band 4 while in the description it says that this particular phone does.The phone itself is awesome. Loved how it looked, loved how it felt, especially loved the quality of the images. However I am sending it back because I do need to do be able to use some of the functionality that you can only get on a US compatible phone such as mobile hotspot.Again, Love the phone just make sure if you're hoping to use it as an LTE phone in the US, make sure the RM number is 877.",134,3
Nokia,"1st Day (5 stars)I watched many reviews trying to decide if to buy this phone. Many of the reviews said to make sure to buy the camera grip. (It costs about a US$70 extra)....I almost cried with joy at the surprise of seeing that the camera grip came with this!!!! :) I specifically bought mine from SHOPBEST btw. So far, everything is GREAT.I will update this more as I use it but initial reaction and use is - love4th Day (3 stars) After first use. I won't recommend another person to buy this phone because the sheer short battery life is just not worth it even though i've employed all possible energy saving settings. I thought the app eco system wouldn't bother me that much, but it does. I have a big problem with Whatsapp and Push Notifications not working as well :/",10,3
Nokia,"Amazon had a warehouse deal for a yellow nokia lumia 1020 rm-875 with a camera grip. Unfortunately all I got was a black unit with the charger and headphones. I was very very disappointed - expressed it to amazon and was able to get a partial refund as a result.The Nokia Lumia 1020 - the device is AMAZING. It's just a welcome change going from iOS to a Windows phone. I have a Windows 8 laptop and just thought to myself it's time for a change. The camera is the most important thing to me when it comes to my phone anyway so I said I'm going for it.I had the easiest time transferring my contacts (with nokia's data transfer, was preinstalled on the phone) from my iphone to nokia (usually the hardest part when switching devices, especially when an iphone is involved!)I'm getting the hang of the phone, but can say I'm extremely happy with my purchase, just extremely disappointed in amazon!",10,4
Nokia,The product is everything I expected and more. The camera is awesome. I own a Nikon D90 and have not touched it since I received the phone. I highly recommend this item but the market does not provide much in the way of accessories. I expect that will change.,10,4
Nokia,"I am a serious photographer and so having a camera around me at all times is a great thing. That is the sole weakness of my full frame DSLR system and the Nokia 1020 (Microsoft 1020 now?) fits the bill. For review of the camera look elsewhere - there are many and all are positive.Actually, I did not purchase the phone from Amazon. Why? I placed the order with one of the companies associated with Amazon. They took the money and disappeared. When the phone did not arrive at the time it was supposed to, I had to fill a relatively simple online form with Amazon. I was not the only one duped, so Amazon knew about this company and the association was cancelled. I called Amazon shortly after filling the form. I talked to a very pleasant lady that appreciated the discomfort and frustration I felt, promptly processed my request for reimbursement and I received the money promptly. Great service Amazon!!!! although I hope you will not have to go through this.I purchased Nokia 1020 from another online vendor. For me the surprise is the Windows 8 environment. This is my first smartphone, so I do not have in mind anything to compare it to. It does not seem too difficult to learn to use it. Everybody talks about a dearth of apps. Perhaps this is an issue if you want a specific app that is not available on Windows or if you are an app collector. If you just want a couple of apps to do a few basic things (GPS, VOIP, Battery utility etc.), you have great many apps to choose from (free and for pay), and some of them seem good.Aesthetically, the phone is sleek, it fits comfortably in my hand and feels substantial. It meets my expectations based on my reading before the purchase and I am pleased.",48,5
Nokia,"As news states, this phone is known for its 41MP camera and grip. It takes pictures beautifully. The phone is comfortable in your hands and fits very nicely-it feels extremely sturdy.I would say the loud colour promotes a persons character. Only gripe is that it is not LTE capable. But why worry about that when there is a 41MP camera? ^_~As promised, the phone is unlocked and navigating the settings to work with my local network had no difficulties. ~TWO THUMBS UP~",37,4
Nokia,"I've used iPhone 3, 4, 4S and finally 5. When it died on me 3 weeks ago, I said enough already! Every iPhone I've had something wrong and Apple geniuses open their mouths with $100 min to fix it. Anyways, I tested Samsung 4S and to be honest it was pretty cool, but a hunch you can say, led me to Lumia. The reason was basically my new Dell with windows 8. I love that win 8 OS. As being a long time Mac guy, I can easily say that windows 8 has the best UX, fast, fluid and 'smart' by far. On mobile basis Lumia is the best smart phone I've ever seen. It's an amazing user experience with great hardware quality. I strongly recommend Lumia and win 8. It takes everything you know about smart phones to a new and amazing level. Believe me you won't be touching iPhone or Android phones ever again. One sentence about the seller, they are pretty good.",31,5
Nokia,"Excellent product, I was so used to Android Os, so I was a little scared changing to WP but this OS is Faster, more stable, simpler, I'm not an app guy so the few apps available in WP8 store are not a problem, Call quality is Excellent and so the volume of the speaker. my contacts got synchronized from Google without a problem. and the Camera! Just amazing! The package included the camera grip, so i have extra battery for taking photographs and the feel of a camera.Since this is the international Version the phone receives the newest Updates that Nokia releases without waiting the carrier.",27,5
Nokia,"I finally received my phone after a mixup in the post office,but i,ll excuse that because this is the holiday season and lots of mail.Since this is my 1st windows phone it took a little time to learn the functions.I wanted the factory unlocked version and that,s what i got-the RM875 version.I just have to go to T-Mobile store and get a micro sim since i had the regular sim and i was set to go!This phone is absolutely no comparison to the 2 Nokia phones i had previously-N8 ,N95.It,s speed i can compare about equal to my laptop.I like the ability to store my pictures on Skydrive in the future when i get a lot on the phone so phone won,t fill up.Also the size is perfect-not too big,not too small.Nokia finally has a phone that is in line with other smartphones around.I just wish Nokia would offer factory unlocked versions of their high end lines like Apple,HTC,samsung does.I tried purchasing at stores-Microsoft store,Best Buy and i can,t find any and 3rd party unlocking places are unable to unlock the AT+T version so i don,t want to take the chance and get a phone i can,t use so i opted to buy on Amazon and got the product i am looking for!Thank you for an amazing product!",25,5
Nokia,"When this first came out I scoffed at the lame looking camera. Well now I have to eat my words as this phone/camera combo is awesome! I have a Nokia 925 which I like but this one is the best out of the bunch. The windows phone format doesn't bother me too much as I am an adult and don't really use my phone for gaming, just internet, light browsing, and navigation when I travel. It does all of those well. As for the photos I will upload a few for you to judge. They are not at 41mp, just 8 I think but the toad is handheld at night and the other is in the middle of the day above Bogota, Colombia.",23,5
Nokia,"This is by far, the greatest camera a playing-sound quality phone I've ever had...also the quality and colours of the display are stunning!!I've had a nokia E7, then a samsung sII, lumia 900 and iphone 4s in the past...But for me, this is the most productive and best quality phone I ever buy!!I'm am studying Transport/Industrial design, so this is the best choice for someone like me!...I don't know why some people complain about the OS, It's just bad publicity. For me It's just so fluid and intuitive...and for the apps, if you want productivity and real-use gourgeos design apps, more than games and silly things, this will be your best choice. ;)",13,5
Nokia,"I purchased the phone in February. It worked super great. Loved the camera, loved the options and all my apps. I was super careful with it. Then one day in May the screen stopped working. I tried all the possible sollutions. I even contacted the seller to ask about the warranty. BUT, I never got a simple responce from the seller :( Then I called the customer service and found out that the phone didn't have a warranty in the US... To repair the screen will be from 150$ and up...and from all the research I've done so far - it's a common thing for Nokia Lumia 1020 to have such issues... Next time, it would be nice, if the seller notifies the customer, that the expensive purchase they are about to make will not be covered by the factory warranty...So 1 star is to the seller and 2 stars to the phone itself because of the issue.",19,1
Nokia,"Other users don't like the operating system, it does not have millions of apps available like the iPhone or Android phones have, but there are still plenty of apps available and if you are willing to pay for the apps there are plenty. I even find the voice recognition for text messages and Bing searches understands my voice better than Siri does on the iPhone. The camera is what makes this phone worth the money, with so many different modes it is easy even for novice camera users.Only reason for 4 stars is that with the camera grip, there is basically no protective case available for the phone. You have to remove the camera grip for a protective case to fit.",18,4
Nokia,I purchased the Nokia Lumia 1020 (factory unlocked) 41 MP PureView camera on Amazon. When came I was so excited and immediately turned it on.....THE LANGUAGE WAS CHINESE! I couldn't even get to a place where I could understand how to change the language setting and Nokia couldn't get me there either over the phone. Luckily I have a good friend who knows the Chinese language and after a few taps she had it in English. I put a sim card from Wal-Mart straight talk and it works like a dream. It's very easy to use and the pictures are amazing. LOVE IT!!!!,17,5
Nokia,"This phone is a year old and other than the camera, has internals that are about 2 years old. That said, this thing is awesome. I challenge you to buy a two-year old Android phone, put the newest version of Android on it, and not throw it in a lake within a week. I have owned a LOT of cheap Android devices in the past, some which I have paid as much as I paid for this phone. They all we're slow and sluggish, and within a few months, we're unusable. That has not been my experience with Windows Phone. Before buying this 1020, I had a Nokia 521. 1 GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM. Android or iOS would come to a screeching halt if you those low specs at it. Windows Phone flys on such low specs. I had the 521 for a year, and now it's being used as a dedicated game system for the kids running graphically intense racing games. Still doing great.So, when you put Windows Phone on decent specs, then look out. I am having one hell of a pleasant experience with this phone. Smooth as butter, even with ""older"" specs. I point this out, because if you are like me, and came from the Android world, you know you don't want to spend this kind of change on old specs. You shouldn't have these concerns with this phone. Turned it on, and it updated to the newest WP 8.1, which is running blazing fast. No lag. None. Everything is smooth.The camera. Holy cow. Once you figure it out, it's amazing. Here is the trick, though. The camera saves two images, a 38 MP image and a 5 MP image processed from the bigger one. The screen shows the 5 MP, so if you pinch to zoom in, it won't look very good. You need to open the image in Nokia Creative Studio and reframe. You can then zoom in on that flea sitting on your dog and it's crystal clear. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but not much. I took a picture of a can of soda that was sitting across the room, and I could zoom in later and clearly read the nutrition information on the side of the can. The xenon flash means no blur with motion. It freezes the motion. This is great if your like me and have small children that won't sit still for a picture. It is a little slow shot to shot. The app pops up fast, but if you want to take 10 shots in 10 seconds, then no go. It takes time to process that 38 MP image. I don't find it to be a problem, since the xenon flash prevent blurring so I get a great shot the first time. Very happy with the camera.As far as apps, I have all the apps I need. Plus, I've found some apps that are windows exclusive that blow away iOS or Android. I can download maps and use GPS with no data service. This was VERY useful when I went to Argentina. No data, but I had the country maps downloaded, so the cab drivers had a tough time ripping me off. Mix Radio lets you make playlists based on artists or genres, like Pandora. The difference is I can take up to 16 hours of playlists offline with Mix Radio and no ads. That means I listen to great ""streaming"" music in my car without using a single MB of data. These are awesome features with the metered data plans you get with AT&T. All the other big things are there. Facebook. Twitter. Fitbit. Whatever. OneDrive is awesome. Dropbox is downgrading me to 2 GB since my old Samsung 2 yr promotion is over. I didn't know what I would do, but now I have 18 FREE GB with OneDrive. Plus, when I get a Office365 subscription, I'll get a free 1 TB. 1 TB AND Office for less than a Dropbox upgrade.I worry about buying phones from 3rd parties on Amazon. I don't want my phone to come in Korean or Czech. I want a US version with US frequency bands, because I live in the US. Joycells ships a brand new, unopened, unsealed Nokia Lumia 1020 locked to AT&T. I have not seen this phone anywhere for $299. It's hard to find a USED 1020 on ebay for that price. And... You actually get a new phone. Good deal. I did 1 day shipping for $3.99 and had it the next day. Thanks Amazon. Popped in an AT&T SIM card, and it just worked. 4G LTE running fast. It is NOT unlocked, but it isn't advertised as such. I have AT&T so it's no problem. In 6 months, they'll unlock it for me.Do not buy this phone through Amazon Mobile with a contract. If you do, you'll pay att $99 for the phone, $40 activation fee, and an extra $15 per month minimum for 2 years. Do the math. That's $500 vs. $299. I think Amazon Mobile will set you up for $0.01, but you still pay activation and the extra $15 per month. Still $100 more in the end. Next is worse. Over 24 months you'll pay the full retail price of $600. That's twice as much. You're better off putting the thing on an Amazon credit card and paying ridiculous interest over 2 years than that deal.",19,5
Nokia,"OK,I have to be honest, I bought the phone for the camera and I have not been disappointed; it's great!I've taken pictures of city skylines at night while in a plane, actively landing. Both the focal point and the 'pinpoints' of light on the ground came out crisp and clear.I've taken 'closeups' of people that look ~90% as good as a professional, posed photo.The camera is so fast that it captures 'split second' motion w great detailSince I travel alot for work I can take stunning travel photos without having to lug around a regular camera.The phone functioning gets about 3-1/2 to 4 stars; sometimes the sound is not great and conversations are muffled.on the ther hand, the 'smart phone' functions surpass the iPhone( I have the 5S as a work phone) due to the absolute 'lightning fast speed! also, interface looks better.....",17,5
Nokia,"I am upset only to the fact that they are advertising that it is 4G, yes it is, but not on US networks. On T-mobile it is only capable of 2G; The RM-994 is capable of 3G on at&t network only, T-mobiles 2G. The RM-996 is only 2G capable in the US. So please know this before you buy, Like I did..",16,3
Nokia,"This phone surpassed my expectations. Speed, connectivity and battery life are all superb; combine these with a big, REALLY high resolution screen, and this is, by far, the best phone I've ever owned.",10,5
Nokia,"I have been using smart phones since the Palm Treo 600, so I am not new to this. this is the nicest phone I have ever owned. I purchased the red one and everyone just stops and stares at it and windows 8 is great is is the best phone software available.",11,5
Nokia,"Though the OS is second to none IMO - and the design, shape and size being brilliant, I have to score this phone (not necessarily the AT&T or TMO branded phones), but the Nokia factory phone, as lame. When I first got it the OS was 8.0 and I had a few issues.1. The unlock screen would register taps that I did not do. This being rectified by hitting the power button to lock it and then bring it back to the unlock screen.2. Sometimes when the keyboard would come up it would be all fuzzy, though it would clear up after 5 - 10 seconds, it was hard to read and sucked to have to wait.3. Signal strength at certain locations (my house for one) would drop to no service. This in comparison to my 925,821 and HTC 8x, where the signal was fine. So I am not sure if this is a phone issue or a TMO service issue. But TMO sent out a signal booster and that did not do much.Nokia says it is TMO's fault cuz the signal is fine downtown and therefore cannot be hardware so it must be TMO - Makes sense. TMO says it is Nokia's fault because my other phones work at home and the 1520 does not, which also makes sense.4. Camera button seems to be hyper sensitive, so much so that if you touch the housing on the back of the phone and not the actual button the camera will come on.. though this is not an every time occurrence, it happens enough to be a major pain when trying to actual do work on the phone.So I installed windows 8.1 - now since it is not a supported OS, TMO no longer cares nor does Nokia.So I am stuck with a phone where at home I have no service and when I am out and about and want to do something on the phone I have the lock screen issue and the damned camera problem to contend with.. Though on the plus side, the blurry keyboard problem seemed to have gone away with 8.1.Updated 6.27.2014It has been 114 days since purchase and the screen is registering multiple touches, and at different locations. Example, phone pad open you hit 3 and it will sometimes register two 3's, or a 1 3 and and 8.. This I mention above and thought it was software.. turns out if you look at the screen from an angle you can actually see the registered click on the 8 when touching the 3.. Microsoft stored confirmed it was hardware failure, suggested to return it.Mobile front only has something like a 15 day grace period for returns\exchanges. Amazon cannot\will not do anything because they do not have to.Called Nokia, they say that there is a 1 year factory warranty on the device but that it is only for the originating order, ie Mobile Front.. so they cannot do anything.So Nokia has a 1 year warranty on it with Mobile Front and MF turns around and gives you a 15 day warranty.My bad for not looking more into that before ordering.Will never buy 3rd party again.. Strongly advise not to purchase from Mobile Front.. go directly to Nokia.",14,1
Nokia,"Don't go with this seller! They claim that the phone is factory unlocked, but in fact it's locked for at&t! And when I tried to contact them about the issue, they told me it's possible to return the device! But guess what, there were too many fees for restocking the device! So they'll cut the price and I'm going to lose my money for nothing! That's really a shame! Simply AVOID AVOID AVOID them! @cellphone lifestyle",85,1
Nokia,"I've had a Lumia 920 that for me is still a really good phone.But when I compare my 920 with the new 1520 the difference is gigantic in many ways.First of all, the size. It's a big phone, but in my opinion is not an enormous.The size helps a lot when you are typing, by the way it has the best keyboard I've ever used.The other thing that jumps to your when you first use it is the quality of the screen. The colors are so vivid that is hard to go back to my 920 after using the 1520.It also has a really fast CPU (the Snapdragon 800) that makes the navigation so smooth.The battery is also impressive, I can use it for at least a day and half without having to charge ir.And finally, the camera. Although it has not the 1020 41mp camera, this 20mp camera still beats all other cell phone cameras in the market.After using the 1520 with the upgraded WP8, I found myself looking at Android phones and Iphones, and thinking they all look the same crap compared to the Lumia.",18,5
Nokia,"Nokia Lumia 635 is an okay to good phone for an entry level Windows/Smartphone. This had Windows 8.1 on it and functions well. Allows for basic needs of calling, texting, email, internet, and apps. Only issue is to beware of the seller in the marketplace even if it is fulfilled by Amazon. The listing here mentions ""Unlocked GSM 4G LTE"" but some sellers just send AT&T GoPhone which are locked to the AT&T network. If the seller sends a genuine UNLOCKED mobile/cellphone then it will work on the 4G LTE networks in the USA. The 4G LTE network in the USA usually is the 1900 band which this phone is capable.Pros on the phoneA. Fast boot upB. Apps are fairly niceC. Feels sturdy in the handsD. Not a gigantic feel like some phonesCons of the PhoneA. Cortana keeps popping up even if you don't want to use it (This depends on your preference)B. Transfer Data from old Nokia phones requires an app, simple bluetooth transfer/sync didn't work with our older Nokia phones.Overall, mostly satisfied for a basic Windows Nokia phone. The main point is beware and conscious of the seller in the marketplace, even if it is ""Fulfilled by Amazon"". The seller that was fulfilled by Amazon was ""Reliable Communication"" and it was an AT&T GoPhone not completely unlocked.EDIT: As I continue to monitor feedback on my reviews and the comments I left on seller, I noticed my seller review was deleted. So this confirms my advice about being cautious on who you choose. ""Reliable Communication"" seller I would steer clear from completely. Very shady seller. Choose a seller who has had good feedback and a long positive history even if ""Fulfilled By Amazon"" is there. Phone still works good as a basic entry level Windows phone. Nothing more.",138,4
Nokia,"Wrong description, phone locked",98,1
Nokia,"I don't know whether this phone is truly unlocked because I didn't have another provider's sim to try. I'm on an ATT network anyway so my sim was good to go. I like the Windows platform... better than Android, it seems more stable and more organized. This is an entry level phone but it does all I need a device to do at this point in my life. I gave up a lot of flashy hardware extras, and some software extras by making this move backwards. My only regret is the lack of apps that allow more control over personalizing the phone's use. This model doesn't support an automatic power on/off ... or a gravity or proximity sensor sleep/wake for the screen. It doesn't support the double tap screen ""wake up"" either. I will be using the power button a lot more than I had to with the newer Androids, and I wish Windows or Nokia would update the hardware controls to offer those features. Otherwise, the 635 is sturdy, lightweight, the right size, and I don't miss not having an led flash because the camera takes decent pix without one. I find Cortana a little dense at times, but we're getting along okay. I wish Nokia would put a voice microphone on the keyboard, independent of Cortana, for those of us who like to dictate text rather than type. Bottom line, it's a real nice phone, but not a great one. I don't do email or social media, or play action games on it... it's basically my phone and information highway",54,4

Nokia,"This product if a fake, likely channeled by the company producing it (or by some of their employees) through the grey market. The box and the user manual are the typical, disgusting Chinese attempt to mimic originals. The box says only ""Lumia 635"" using an improbable font and background color, without the usual Nokia or Microsoft logo or copyright disclaimers. The user manual is a poorly done scan of the original, and effectively unusable.If your moral is fine with supporting companies that abuse consumers and adopt such practices in the name of profit and greed, then the phone itself is a good bargain and mine came unlocked.

Nokia,"First, a little background, for perspective: I'm an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I've really liked the Android OS and the phones I've bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It's heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and ""experts"" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There's something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS's, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the ""People"" tile ... Facebook posts of friends ""pop up"" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say ""It is Friday Night"" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it's own. I've got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music ""block"", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn't think I'd ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it's been a very nice bonus. I've already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it's back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION! Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I've since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928? Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It's smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the ""expert"" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it's ""horrible dearth of apps"". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don't know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it's bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I've got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash, the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I've also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I've been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I've got an instant backup of everything I've taken.I'm not going to spend any time hashing-out or ""reviewing"" technical details, you'll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I've ever owned.",90,5
Nokia,"I have a Nokia N8 that I wanted to upgrade and since Nokia's build quality speaks for itself I went for a Lumia.I wanted a phone with expandable memory as my music and photos are on the MicroSD card and I also wanted a phone with at least 1GB of RAM.So I got this Lumia 820.So far the phone has been great, save for some basic features I really miss like FM Radio, Flip to Silence, select a custom message alert, the ability to set separate volume for alarms, music, ringtones, etc., notification center, some kind of visual alert that I have missed a call, alert or a sms so I don't have to turn the screen on to check, have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, and some other things I already have on a 3 years old phone but missing on a phone launched 5 months ago.The battery life is not as great as with the N8 but then again it's a 680 MHz 3.5 inches vs a 1.5GHz Dual Core 4.3 inches phone.I'm liking the phone so far as the UI is very fast but untill I get back all the funtionality I now have on my 3 years old Symbian phone, the N8 will stay with me as my primary phone. Maybe I can retire it for an Android phone as it has nearly all the features and functionality Symbian has.",10,4
Nokia,"I bought this as a trial, I've used BB7, BB10, Android, and now WP8. I found things about every one of them that is preferrable to the others. I don't like the fact that this is an unlocked AT&T phone, that should be noted on the product page (not that it's 'factory unlocked').The flow of the OS is quite simple and easy to use, everything is in alphabetical order in the apps list, and the Start screen lets you put whatever apps you want on it and in any order. One weird thing about the 820 (WP8?) is the back arrow vs the Windows button. If you use the Windows button then press the back button it will return to the program you closed (doesn't happen on Android). There are many very useful apps for this OS. Offline maps and translators are quite useful when you're traveling, especially when they're free.The phone itself is nicely designed, simple and clean, and the build quality seems good. The battery cover is a bit difficult to remove (make sure you have everything you want/need to put in when you do this, so it's only required once). The camera is very good and the pictures are clear. For the individual who sat on his phone, it's not shocking at all that it broke, and quite uncertain whether Gorilla Glass would have made a difference.",31,5
Nokia,"I received the phone just as indicated, BRAND new and everything included. The phone was a gift for my dad who will use it in Dominican Republic. He activated it and had no issues whatsoever. Thank you!!",22,5
Nokia,"Bought my second Nokia Lumia 822. This one I bought from Mango instead of Verizon as Verizon no longer carries it. My first one I bought in 2012 at the Verizon dealers advice, and I loved the phone. I dropped it in a river two years later and had to replace it. Verizon stopped carrying the phone and told me it was obsolete, and talked me into an I-phone 5s or 5c. I ended up having that phone for 1 and 1/2 months, and I loved it, (except for the texting, windows phones are much better for texting) before I dropped it at the train station and destroyed it. The 2014 I-Phone did absolutely nothing that my 2012 Lumia 822 didn't do. It was really a joke to spend more for the I-Phone when the Nokia Lumia 822 did everything the I-Phone 5 did. The only thing I liked better about the I-Phone was that it came standard with bus routes for their mapping apps. I loved that, exact times of bus routes and trains around the country and select the fastest route. It really didn't get any easier. But I found an app for the windows phone that did the same thing. HERE MAPS app does the same thing and it is free. Or you could just use google maps. All in all, Apples' new I phone 5 does nothing the Nokia Lumia 822 doesn't do. I bought mine from Mango Vendor for $100 new two days ago. Works great. Thankyou Mango.",35,5
Nokia,"Awesome phone, been using iPhone for 8 years (different models), and I think iOS becoming obsolete in direct competition with Android and Windows phones, for the price i paid it's so liberating to know the fact that it is better than the iPhone, not the top phone from Nokia but it's awesome enough for daily task and then some.If you're having a problem with this phone try these tips, go to support profile.apple .com and you need to disassociate from your previous iPhone products, in order to snd/rec text, people that you know needs to disable iMessage in Messaging, you should be okay after that.Give this phone a try and you'll just be amazed that your iPhone is no longer as awesome as it used to.btw! my iPhone 5 took water damage and they wanted $170 for replacement that's with insurance, i think you'll get more mileage with this phone(822Lumia), Hope this helps.",21,5
Nokia,"Excellent cell phone! It's really unlocked for all carriers. In Venezuela has a great works in 3G & H+ with Movilnet, Movistar and Digitel. It's really amazing, faster, wonderful screen, great cam and sound. Buy it and enjoy it! Obviously do not work 4G here because it's is LTE 700Mhz and our carriers works LTE 1800Mhz Digitel and LTE 1900MHZ Movistar (this don't be official yet but it works). Liberado realmente para todas las operadoras GSM.",13,5
Nokia,"This is my first windows phone. I bought it as a temporary phone since my Note 2 died an unexpected death due to ocean water, and I'm still on contract. The phone works on Verizon and is unlocked for ATT and T mobile. I was planning on using this phone for a month or two until the Note 4 came out on Verizon, but I like it so much I might use it longer. The screen is bright and clear for its size. It is fast for most uses, with no lag. Faster than my Note 2. It may not have as many apps as Android, but the Apps that I downloaded look just as good, if not better then their Android versions. One feature that I did not know about is the double tap to turn on, similar to the LG feature. I had trouble getting it to recognize my Gmail account, but the Windows Update fixed it. Unlocked phone for under $100. Can't beat it for the price. Great world phone, primary phone or backup phone.",18,5
Nokia,"First some things that the product description doesn't say. Yes, it's the RM-984. I got this because I'm on T-Mobile and am not holding my breath that they'll release a decent flagship Windows Phone anytime soon (I don't count anything made by HTC anymore - build quality is hit-and-miss and they don't bother supporting their products). Unfortunately, this phone does not support their LTE bands; it does appear to support HSPA+ so it's not a huge downgrade but that may still be a deal-breaker for many buyers. I'm not sure it is for me - though I would still have preferred the 985. Also, it takes a nano SIM, in case anyone needed to know.Onto the phone itself -Pros:* Despite the processor being said to be underpowered, performance is actually pretty snappy in most things I use a phone for. It looks like it's not great in games, but I've yet to run into problems in ""regular"" apps.* A high(-ish)-end Nokia phone smaller than a bus (I have nowhere to put a 1520) that actually has a Micro-SD slot? I never thought I'd see the day...* Pretty good camera for the money. I don't know if I've scratched the surface on this thing though - mostly just relieved to have something that isn't awful (thanks HTC)* The ""feel"" of the phone is actually really nice. I was an instant fan of the metal trim as soon as I took it out of the box.Cons:* It's still under-specced for the price compared to certain Android phones in a similar class. Can't really hide from this.* ...it doesn't support LTE on T-Mobile. Reportedly the RM-985 model does, but this is not it.",57,4
Nokia,"I don't know where to start but I'm so happy on what I ordered. First, I was so worried about the phone whether it will work on AT&T. I did not want to buy that clumsy AT&T branded black Lumia 830. I did not know that this phone needed nano sim so I had to go to AT&T store. They gave me the sim and wallahhh I was ready to go with AT&T LTE connection. The phone is so clean and beautiful without any crappy AT&T apps. The phone itself is so beautiful that I just can't compare it with any other phone out there. Yes, the phone hardware is less attractive as other competitors but I did not feel any lag or any issue. I've been WP users since 2010, and that may be why I'm very happy with the phone :) This is the best WP that I bought in 4 years, I had Samsung, and Lumia 920 before.I live in Northern VA and I get AT&T LTE in most area, haven't seen h or hspa or hspa+.Second, I have never had next day delivery and surprisingly I received the phone within 16 hours.I highly recommend this phone and of course the seller.Enjoy!",10,5
Nokia,"I received this product yesterday and firstly the box was in a terrible condition it looked like if a ""mechanic"" rubbed his hands all over it....If that wasn't bad enough when i opened the box the charger was not in it's original packaging and the actual handset looked like the person who handled it was having fries for lunch because it was greasy and disgusting. The film which protected the screen had so many bubbles indicating it was removed and replaced which would be an indication that the phone was used.I payed for a new phone not a used phone and this item was purchased to be given as a christmas gift....How can i give this to someone?I will be returning same",10,1
Nokia,it is not an unlocked phone. it is AT&T locked phone. It does not work with any sim GSM carrier. Not what have been described,10,1
Nokia,I can say I was truely deceived. The phone was described as Factory Unlocked but I was shocked to discover that the phone is locked even as I write this review. I wrote to Amazon and they gave me back $25 for each of the phone for me to unlock it in my local. The issue is that I have not been able to do that.,57,1
Nokia,"Sometimes the phone hangs while receiving or ending calls and then shuts down for a long long long time. It has to have specific head phones that only work with windows os. And when you go buy head phones at stores, obviously the sales person won't let us pop up the packaging to try out and find out that it works on this phone. So ended up buying couple of them and none of them worked. But it does not say anywhere that this will require specific head sets and the universal ones do not work anywhere here.",13,1
Nokia,"The product was supplied on schedule.My reservation for this Product is that IS NOT fully FACTORY UNLOCKED! Some functions (BLUETOOTH, INTERNET SHARING) are not working, they are locked to ""att.com""The product is very good and has become a mobile office of a sort for me, within the very short period I own it!I recommend the genuinely FACTORY UNLOCKED to all international buyers outside United State of America.",147,3
Nokia,"The problem is not just the cellphone that it's meant to be factory unlocked and it's not but is also the support. The cellphone has some features locked to work just with AT&T and not unlocked as i Buy it. I dont return it because i live outside the states and is not that easy to me to return it.The other thing is that they dont give me a solution, that should be a software issue. They call me one month ago, when i wrote a negative review and ask me to delete it that they were going to work on it. After I delete the feedback i haven't received any information about my problem or whats happening.",81,1
Nokia,The phone came without earphone and it is NOT factory unlocked!!!! I really want my money back. Don't buy it!!,41,1
Nokia,"First of all the delivery of the product was late. Coming to the device, Phone looks as if it is being refurbished by the seller. Nothing else comes with it, just a phone and a charger. Not to mention a pathetic packaging.Lumia 900 is an old product now and unless you are a lumia freak and money is a constraint for buying unlocked lumia 920, I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this phone while plethora of other phones available in market.",11,2
Nokia,Excellent product. I'm in Venezuela and I received my phone before the expected arrival date and in excellent condition. The cell it's really Unlocke. It has wonderful Nokia apps already installed. It's the best phone I've ever has. Thankssss,11,5
Nokia,"This is an At&T unlocked phone, not a fabric unlocked.All the box and some apliccations are connected with this brand. Some issues with data connection.Its better to pay a little bit more and get an fabric unlocked model and you wont be bothred with at&t logo all time that you turn on this cell phone.",33,3
Nokia,"I ordered this phone for my daughter on July 30, 2013. Got it a week after, it DOES NOT WORK now,it was not dropped or any such thing, it just decided to not turn on one day even after charging it. Therefore she only received one month of usage of this phone. After this happen, I opted to contact the seller to get either a refund or a replacement, i am being told i CANNOT!!! This is utter crap, now i have no idea what steps to take next..... NEEEEDDDDD HEEEELLPPPPP!",30,1
Nokia,it has been locked again i think as was not promised. so not good i strongly oppose this seller so,12,1
Nokia,"Don't you guys ever buy any phone from this company , they will see you used phone and its a all defective . i bought one and when i received it in the mail the box was looking old . and it have only charger no , headphone nothing . and it has problem of voice rebounding so i told them to changed it for me and they send another one . but i didn't open the box. i only open the package , i didn't open the box because the seal of the box looks already open and the box look used ,",12,1
Nokia,This is totally frustating as though I have paid for the new one and extra shipping cost it arrived at me as a used one which is contradictory with the add heading. Now I have wait without any cell because of this rubbish.,12,1
Nokia,"Before I comment on the product, I must mention that when I received it in the ATT box with the ATT logo on it I was terrified the phone would be locked. As it turns out, the phone is unlocked. No issues there. Also, I'm not on AT&T. I'm on Simple Mobile, which runs on TMobile, so my comment on 3g/4g speeds will be non-existent.1. Fantastic reception on the phone so far. Where I couldn't get reception in the past, I get a strong signal on this phone. Many people blame reception solely on networks, but obviously phone reception plays a part.2. Enough apps for me. I'm not a mass appeal games freak, so I'm not going to lose the plot at the fewer games available, and, heaven forbid, needing to pay $0.99 for Angry birds. I can get all the other things that I want, either the same app as Android or by a third party that fulfills the same function (was on android before this)3. The battery life is ok. It lasts through a day and then some, of course depending what you use it for. I use the phone for calls, some surfing, apps for a range of thing from weather to my Sonos to the kindle.4. Fantastic price. I know Lumia 920 is out but I also know a one year old model is young enough to be relevant and old enough to receive the shipment of the model without the initial launch quirks.5. Xbo smartglass works well, which isn't a big deal but it's a nice convenience when I'm watching netflix on the xbox from the bed.6. Stable. Actually stable.7. The ringer volume has a huge range. That was an issue with my last phone. I like the range. 0-30.As time goes by I'm sure I'll have more to add and maybe it'll show itself to be a dud (though I honestly hope not). Maybe some day Tmobile/Simple Mobile will add the required frequency to get 3g on this phone but I have no issues with Edge for what I use the data access for and I'm mightly pleased with this pretty piece of mobile technology. When everyone had Nokia phones, I never had one, so I'm surprised that I've gone there with this, but they did a good job. I hope they survive the slump they're in because they make good phones.",18,4
Nokia,The phone is not unlocked. It is from at&t. I cant get it to work with another carrier. I am feeling so disapointed. How can i do it?,17,1
Nokia,"The phone came in a small box that was marked with a fake AT&T logo and it has no OEM packaging nor the booklet that contains the SIM chip, the instructions on how to operate the phone, put in the memory chip, etc. On the inside of the box it says"" The cellular phone contained herein DID NOT emanate from the OEM, and no representations nor warranties are made as to the source of the origin. But in the ad I bought from, it said that the phone is NEW, FACTORY UNLOCKED. Hmmm, curious. Then the phone MAY be used or new or a refurbished model restored to operable condition. Bottom line.... is this a NEW PHONE with a valid AT&T / Nokia warranty? The ad doesn't say any of this other stuff / B.S. in it. That's unfair. I like buying from Amazon too. I will try the phone out since it just got here today on 29 JAN 2013. But I'm worried.... is their a ""CARFAX"" for cellular phones? :(",15,3
Nokia,"This phone is great! It's the best phone I've ever owned. I have been a dedicated high end Android user, but I found this phone to be a much more satisfying experience than either the iPhone or the Android phones. I want an OS that will meet my current needs and have a great user interface with a good amount of apps available for me to manage my daily mobile cell phone use, and not have to make expensive phone upgrades all the time. The Nokia Lumia 900 is a very well constructed phone.The aesthetics are pleasing, it's modern and function goes well beyond my expectations. It operates very fast and smooth even though it has a single core processor and only 512MB on RAM. If you are not aware of these specs, you might think it has a multi-core processor and more RAM on board. Nokia has come up with a phone that is both pleasing in design and very efficient when it comes to performance. The screen is bright with beautiful color saturated screen, and seems to have less glare outside when it's sunny. I can actually read the screen in such conditions. This is a big plus for me! It has 16GB of ROM, which is plenty by itself, but pared with the 7GB of frees cloud storage, it's more than enough for me. I really don't know what the fuss is about concerning the number of apps available for Windows Phones. Unless you are some kind of developer or techy person, there are plenty of apps available for this phone (both from MS, Nokia and third party) for the everyday cell phone user, even business user. The game apps seems so much more refined (probably because there are a lot of Xbox games available for this phone) and they run beautifully on this phone. I travel a lot and I'm really looking forward to using this phone on my trips. I have always liked Nokia phones because of the quality build and support. When I started using a smartphone I got away from Nokia phones and started my Android experience. Now that Nokia has chosen to team up with MS to re-enter the smartphone market, I wanted to try their phones again. What a lovely surprise! I'm crazy for the Lumia 900 and look forward to future offerings from Nokia, if and when I get tired of this phone or need to upgrade. I recommend this phone, it's quality at affordable prices. Great design, sturdy, fast and very easy to use, especially if you run Windows 8 on your computer. Try it! You won't be sorry. By it from Amazon, the best place to shop and that's coming from a person that doesn't or ever has worked for them. I forgot to tell you that there is an upgrade of the operating system to 7.8, which is very similar to Windows 8, available for this phone. It's very easy to install, just install Zune on your Windows computer, connect your phone to USB, and it will find the upgrade and instruct you how to install.",81,5
Nokia,"If you are looking to purchase an unlocked phone do not buy!! The phone it self is great but if you are looking to activate with any company other than at&t buying this phone serves no purpose. It cost me 100 bucks to activate the phone with another service (t-mobile) only to find out that this phone was not unlocked. I have been a week without a phone and it is really nerve racking.It will be at least another 50 bucks to get it unlocked in which I will be waiting 3-5 buisness days to get my phone back. Me personally, cannot wait that long. I will be asking for a refund!!",11,3
Nokia,"I received my phone before the expected arrival date and in excellent condition - New, and the color cyan blue is beautiful. The phone is simply great. It is easy to use, with lots of features, and well built. Good Nokia quality as expected. I have always been a fan of Nokia phones and the Nokia /Microsoft combination is perfect. The touch screen is becoming easier each time. The phone is indeed unlocked and I did take it to my initial cell provider. However,I was not pleased with the speed offered by them and had to switch to another provider - Digicel in the Caribbean is now my new cell provider. What a difference and the 4G LTE speed is simply amazing. Very pleased in all areas, and the phone did not let me down. Additional update to follow if necessary as I use the phone.UPDATE 20 Dec 12:Please note that the seller of my Nokia Lumia 900 unlocked cell phone was Masterdeals. My cell was indeed unlocked and I was able to communicate with them. Still very pleased with the Nokia Lumia 900 !UPDATE 14 SEPT 13:This phone is still working very well. I have never had an issue with it, and I will say over and over again, ""I really like my phone"". Its fast ( good provider ), and I even read books on my phone. Its like my mini PC with easy use of the Microsoft office. I have also dropped it many times, but fortunately it was well protected. Lots of apps, and I am able to track my morning run/walk without a glitch. Unfortunately windows phones are missing the app for Magic Jack, and that is the only important app that I am lacking. Waiting on Magic jack to create an app for Windows phones ! Love the live tiles, and like that I can organize them how I want them - reminds me of my desktop. As you use the phone, you will learn the features. Still a great phone !!!",11,5
Nokia,"Hi,I bought a cell phone by Amazon with the following description: ""Nokia 900 Lumia Blue (Cyan) Factory Unlocked"", Sold by: BLUTEKUSA.When I got the phone I was surprised that box and cell phone were ""at&t"", since the main reason why buy the cell phone was because it was factory unlocked. Also when I insert the SIM, the phone displays a message requesting an unlock code.I wrote to the company and I received excellent advice to unlock the phone.I am very happy with my phone. It's greatThanks.",32,4
Nokia,"I bought this phone because I wanted to use it on TMobile. I've only been frustrated thus far. Because it was originally an AT&T phone, the picture messaging is all screwed up. I actually regret not waiting the extra month or so for the Lumia 820... at least that Nokia was released on TMobile... Overall, the phone os great; I do LOVE Windows phones.",12,4
Nokia,I bought the phone and it was nice but has one problem that my husband did not like. It did turned off and didn't wanna turn on when somebody was calling. So I ruterned the phone. I did ask the seller to send me a new one and they did - but it was the same phone - it even had my baby's picture which we took the first time we used the phone to see the quality of camera - and charger was folded the same way I did it and did not have plastic covers and black cover from front and back of the phone were put there for the second time for sure. But they stil keep telling me it was a new phone. So please buy the phone but NOT from this seller - because the phone is good but service is awfull. And they refunded money but took 10% off the price I paid originaly because they say it was a new phone!!!!,18,1
Nokia,Great phone. Used an iPhone before and I am much happier now with the Lumia.I did not had a tousand apps in my iPhone so the transition was nice and easy.,17,5
Nokia,"The 5 stars rating is as much for the seller (Mega Mobile) as it is for the phone. The phone is a true RM-821 (international unlocked). It looks like it came from HK. Everything is in Chinese (even the documentation). Took me only a couple of minutes to remove the Chinese setting, and replace it with English, and another language. It seems that the phone supports just about any language, and it's really easy to change language setting. (for some language, it requires a download, but with wi-fi it's not an issue).What can I say, the phone is incredible, very responsive, has Nokia Drive, Office, a great camera,... ( the list is too long to write here).The phone is great. but trying to buy the phone was a very frustrating experience. Amazon has a page with one phone specification, and several sellers. Unfortunately some sellers try to sell you an AT&T unlocked for an international version. I found that it's very important for reviewers to start the review with the seller, what was ordered, and what was received. This will tremendously help people who want to buy the international version.I had contact with 4 sellers:1. Hollywood Merchandise (fulfill by Amazon); sold me an AT&T unlocked RM-820(it was advertised as international, factory unlocked). Returned the phone. Thank to Amazon, the process was painless got my money back right away.2. Mega Mobile; sold me this phone, and it is as advertised (international, factory unlocked, RM-821)In between I was in contact with:1. Tablets Distributors; As per their e-mail to me they sell AT&T unlocked phones.2. Global Mobiles; As per their e-mail to me they sell international unlocked phones (RM-821) that come from Europe.Their answer came after I ordered from Mega Mobiles.I hope this helps, the potential buyers who like me want a Nokia Lumia 920 international factory unlocked, but are at a loss as to what seller to buy it from.Update 6/13/13: The phone seems to have the latest updates; OS 8.0.10211.204, firmware: 1232.5957.1308.0004.One thing I forgot to mention about the seller, is that since the plug that was inside the Nokia box was incompatible with the U.S plug outlets. he added a U.S. adapter plug inside the box he sent me (nice touch).Update 11/21/13: Several week ago I installed the Amber update. Made a Great phone even better. Can't wait for the next 2 updates which will be available in the next few months.I liked the phone so much that I bought a second one for a family member. This time I bought the phone from 'The wireless circle'. The phone was as advertised (international version RM-821), and came several days ahead of schedule. This time the phone was from Czechoslovakia. Not a problem as it took only a couple of seconds to change to English (I had already downloaded the English manual for the phone), and actually better for me as it came with an European plug (it also have an US adapter in the box).Update 1/16/14: I would like to clarify few things for potential buyers:1. There are no factory unlocked Lumia phones built for the U.S market.2. Due to the above, buying a factory unlocked Lumia phone in the U.S. is buying from a grey market.3. There is no warranty on those phones, and they are not sealed.4. These phones come from all over the world, and will be in the language of the intended market. Plus it will have some built-in apps (put there by Nokia) that target the local market the phone was intended for. That doesn't mean that the phone was used.5. Setting the phone to your desired language, downloading the user's guide in your desired language and removing the local apps is a matter of minutes.6. The plug will be a plug for the intended market, but there will always be a U.S. adapter in the box. That might one the reason why the box is not sealed.I have bought 4 Lumias (2x 720 and 2x 920) from Amazon (received 6, returned 2 - one was defective, this other was AT&T unlocked). They came from all over; Hong-Kong, Germany, Taiwan, and Czechoslovakia. I am very happy with my purchases, and will do it again.At $320 the Lumia 920 has great specs and is a great deal. If you want to buy a Lumia phone, my advice is:1. Buy the phone fulfilled by Amazon. It might be a little more expensive, but if there is any problem Amazon is much easier to deal with (I received my refunded Money before they received the phone), than if you buy it fulfill by any other seller.2. Even if you buy the phone fulfilled by Amazon, contact the seller to make sure that the phone he sells is what is advertised on the web page.",191,5
Nokia,"I got 2 of these. Returned both.First time I got this product I was sure it was a mistake since it came in an already OPEN AT&T box. This is despite the fact that the description clearly says ""NOT AT&T Unlocked phone!""So I returned it and ordered it again. Got another used AT&T box.DON'T BUY.",50,1
Nokia,"The Lumia 920 is a solid device. The built quality is amazing, and it feels like a tank. Is heavier than most average smartphone (or even some phablets), but when holding it, you know it can't be broken easily.The interface is fluid and fresh, although the customization options are limited to tile size and color.Pros:- Camera: the best smartphone camera I have seen in my life- Nokia apps and services: Specially Maps (Nokia Here) and camera-realated apps.- Windows Phone Marketplace: Many people complains about lack of apps. I found everything I need (mostly free and with no ads).Cons:- No LED notification: coming from BB, this is something I really miss, and I don't know why this is a missing feature on almost every modern smartphone.- Battery: It charges slow (very slow), and discharges fast (really fast). It took 3 hours to charge from 60% to 100% with a 2 amp wall charger. The discharge rate is more than 10% per hour (with regular use, no automatic backups/updates, low level screen brightness and only 2 backgroud apps running), so I cannot get more than 10 hours of juice.- WP8 still feels a little half-baked. Hopefully MS fixes some glitches in the upcoming updates. For example, inhability to close tasks more efficiently, the ""search"" soft button takes me to Bing, instead of search stuff inside the device, etc.Also, I must say that the seller (Heavy Duty Electronics) gave me an excellent service. The device was exactly as advertised and came in a sealed box, 100% brand new, and factory unlocked.",47,4
Nokia,"There are a lot of comments on how people receive defected phones, I was aware of that...so I contact the seller, spent extra money just to ensure I get the right phone.Seller ""Hanssel Free Cell"" claimed that the phone is 1.new 2.sealed 3.having no carrier logos 4. and unlocked.1. The phone isn't new, it has been opened (sticker seal broke, for a ""long time"" already)! And everything is in Arabic or some other languages. And the scary thing is that there are already some apps on there, I suspect that the phone is not new and perhaps used, and plus, the phone has zero juice, which I charged a half hour just to get it turned on.2. The phone is not sealed, not as what seller told me on the e-mail.3. The phone does not have carrier logos on it, I truly appreciate that.4. The phone is unlock, by far, I think.There are so many sellers that are selling this phone, many at even cheaper prices, I bought it under false advertisement, I need an explanation.",45,1
Nokia,It's a AT&T phone. I had it shipped to me in South Korea. It is not unlocked.Cannot detect a network.The box was opened too.Very disappointed in Amazon allowing this.I feel cheated.......Why do you allow this Amazon?,41,1
Nokia,"Do not waste time nor money: this phone is not new, and it is not unlocked, it is an AT&T phone (identified with the AT&T logo on the phone surface and with AT&T apps installed on the phone).The seller sold me a locked and used phone (previous wi-fi networks were saved, for example) and the page said it was a new and unlocked phone.Obviously a fraud.Also, the phone came without earplugs (which is the regular equipment) and with a generic charger, not the Nokia one.I know that for a fact, because my husband bought a similar phone from another vendor a month before, and he did not have all these issues.I wonder if i have to send the IMEI number to the FBI just to check if the phone is stolen or not...",11,1
Nokia,This is deceiving. Phone is neither locked nor it looks absolutely new. It is locked with AT&T and seems like restocked or refurbished. Stay away.,11,1
Nokia,"I'm going to start by saying that I've tried to get a hold of this phone for months but haven't had the chance until now. I got mine from Mobicity. The phone came in dutch, but I was quickly able to switch it to english by using the google translator and selecting the right options. I configured the phone--amazingly, the Windows 8 tablet I have doesn't support POP accounts, but the phone does--had to migrate my contacts to the hotmail account to get them on the phone.I used to be a blackberry user, and it was a little painfull to switch and migrate the data. Windows Phone 8 consolidates all accounts and contacts in the people tile and it takes some time to get used to this. I use whatsapp for chatting and there are some options in blackberry that are not found in the Windows Phone version, such as adding a number to an existing contact. One thing that I trying to do with it is change the tile's color, not all of them but individually. For example, I have 4 email accounts and I would like to differentiate one from the others, but tiles can all change from color not individually.Another thing is that the volume buttons control all volumes at the same time, including ring, speaker, notifications, alarms, etc.Still, this phone rocks. When I take it to meetings, people stare a it. It takes the best pictures with low light I've ever seen. The grip is a little slippery. It has gotten away from my hands on 2 ocassions already and I'm actively looking for a cover.Office experience is great, gravity sensor is a little slow as it needs the phone to be at a given angle before it will tilt the screen.",12,4
Nokia,"I ordered the first one from BREED, fulfilled by Amazon. I received an At&t locked phone. I tried my patience and just order another one from a different seller. Let's wait and see. It will be unfair for Nokia to receive this neg ratings as I love Nokia than Apple or Samsung. Shamed on you Amazon as you let those cheater like BREED survive. Amazon needs to take serious action to protect your reputation and clients.",26,1
Nokia,"I ordered a nokia lumia phone from on the go solutions. the product came defected. after getting them to send me a return package which I had to pay for postage, they ended up refunding only part of the money I paid for the phone. guess what, on the go solution claim I mishandled the phone and that they will retain fifteen percent (15%) of the money I paid. Surprisingly I returned the phone in the same condition as I received it. I never took the phone out of my room for even a second. to cut a long story short. Be wise and don't be a victim like me. You don't want to loose any percentage of your money, don't you? I wont advise anyone to get from them",25,1
Nokia,"I ordered two new unlocked nokia lumia 920 thru Heavy Duty Electronics.I mentioned,when ordered, that those phones where for gifts and should be presented on July 25.Thanks to seller, I have got them before that date.I also asked seller to sell me additional adapter and he sent me before July 25 without additional cost.Thanks again to Heavy Duty Electronics.Great price and service. Recommend to everybody.",24,5
Nokia,"We purchased this phone in May 2013 (Nokia Lumia 920 Black Factory Unlocked 32GB phone 4G LTE 800 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600 - RM-821, Sold by WorldWide Distributors in Amazon.com). The phone stopped working September 2013 with the infamous ""spinning gears"" problems. We try sending it to Nokia for repair, but after providing Nokia the Serial number (IMEI) we have been told that the phone is ""Out of warranty in the US"". We now have a bricked phone, no warranting, no recourse.",13,1
Nokia,"I wanted Windows OS and I had to decide between an HTC 8X (available with T-Mobile) and an unlocked 920 (that I could use with T-Mobile without switching to AT&T).I bought the unlocked 920, I'm playing with it for more then few weeks now, and every time I touch this phone it simply doesn't stop to amaze me. Maybe 8X would have been good too (same OS), but now I have a 920 and really love it. Video and picture quality are without any doubt the best I've ever seen in any phone. The interface is super smooth and totally responsive, absolutely zero lag and zero hiccups and overall provides a very pleasant and refreshing experience. The materials and the design give it a very nice solid non plastic-ish feel. Combined, best pictures on the market (808 PureView excluded), best OS by far, Nokia offline maps and a very solid hardware design - make it the phone of my choice.There is art in technology. Thank you Nokia",19,5
Nokia,"I PURCHASED A NOKIA LUMINA 920 BLACK.I AM PLESANTLY SURPRISED. AT FIRST I DID NOT LIKE THE PHONE SO THE SAME DAY I RECEIVED IT I REQUESTED A RETURN LABEL WHICH I IMMEDIATELY RECEIEVED FROM THE SELLER BUT I STILL HAVE.IF YOU WANT A GOOD SIZE PHONE NOT TO BIG NOT TOO SMALL AND LOOKS GOOD YOU SHOULD GET THIS PHONE BUT WHEN YOU RECEIVE IT TAKE YOUR TIME.ITS NOT AN IPHONE OF WHICH I HAVE IPHONE 1,2,3,4 AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO STAND ON LINE THE DAY THE IPHONE CAME OUT. ITS NOT AN ANDROID GALAXY NOTE 1 WHICH I ALSO HAVE. I BOUGHT THAT ONE FROM AMAZON.THE WINDOWS STORE HAS GREATELY IMPROVED ON ITS APP CONTENT,MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CUSTOMIZE. FOR INSTANCE YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY REPLACE THE ORIGINAL CALENDAR WITH THE CHRONOS CALANDER FROM THE WINDOWS STORE ITS MUCH BETTER.I ALSO DOWNLOADED HIPCLIENT TO LOG INTO MY EXTERNAL SEAGATE HARD DRIVEI ALSO CHANGED MY LOCK SCREEN TO ACCUWEATHER LOCK SCREEN.THIS PHONE IS CUSTOMIZABLE.MY ICONS ON MY HOME SCREEN ARE LIVE I CAN SEE THE ACTUAL TEMPERATURE IN THE ICON UNLIKE MY IPHONE.THE PHONE LOOKS GOOD FEELS GOOD AND WORKS WELL, SO TAKE YOUR TIME ITS A TOTALLY DIFFRENT OPERATING SYSTEM BUT ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT YOU WILL NEVER PUT IT DOWN.I AM WRITING THIS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EITHER NOKIA OR MICROSOFT IS MAKING THEIR POINT VERY WELL.HAD I NOT VENTURED OUT ON MY OWN I WOULD NOT BE ENJOYING THIS PHONE TODAY.DON'T WANT YOU TO MISS OUT.THE PHONE IS FABALOUS.",14,4
Nokia,"I really like this phone. I really do. It is easy to use and lots of cool photo apps that have been taking my sweet time away. This phone did come unlocked and works with a t-mobile sim card. I did purchase this phone new but like most users here I received it used with minor scratches and sadly only came with the charger. I did however manage to get some sort of discount for this condition. Above all this phone is great for any shutterbug. The touch screen is sensitive-- more so than my iPad2!!Now for the cons: not a lot of apps, which is okay! I'm not much of an app user. The only apps I really use on the 920 are facebook, gmail, skydrive and instagraph.that being said the battery life is pretty poor. I was quite shocked after the 100% charge i had it before I slept but then in the morning it dropped to 89%. WOW. What happened? Apparently this is a major problem that Nokia/Microsoft haven't really (at least what I think) brought up. Google tips on how to increase the battery life.Note: this phone is heavier than you might actually expect. But with that aside I'm pretty happy with my purchase. If weight is an issue then wait for the 925.That's why I gave this 4/5 stars.---- Update 7/18/13Now I rate this 2/5 given that the battery life has been dropping more since I tried to increase it. The phone is a phone hog. I've turned off some apps, other items on the phone and put it on the not recommend battery saver mode, but the phone is still sucking up the battery like no other. I may have had a faulty phone... but my experience with it is pretty poor.Poor battery = slow loading time = unhappy customer. I returned this phone and am going to wait for the Nexus 5.",14,2
Nokia,when I shook it i could hear some sound coming form inside of the phone like something was broken... when I received calls the sound was not at all clear...it came in a box which was supposed to be of a yellow lumia 920.... the original charger of nokia was not included.. some cheap white charger was there... (original is black),11,2
Nokia,"Microsoft guarantees support for this phone through at least 2017. That was the main reason for this purchase as I was more than a little tired of Android phones becoming obsolete after a few months. Microsoft had 3 updates waiting for this phone and more on the way after I first turned if on. Since Microsoft bought Nokia, you know they'll be trying to make a good impression with the Nokia products and attempting to get the most out of them.When I bought this for $269 it was a good deal as T-Mobile was charging $408 for the same phone and AT&T was charging $399 for their 925. If you are an AT&T sub, you would still come out ahead getting this and paying the $40 or so to get it unlocked. It has all the frequencies AT&T uses. I subscribe to Simple Mobile and the phone works out of the box with a Simple Mobile SIM since they use T-Mobile's network. Using Simple Mobile instead of T-Mobile saves $10 a month and would make your net cost for the price of the phone $30 after 2 years.The phone is new, runs without lag, and overall is a great phone with a great camera. The 4 star rating is because of the lack of an SD card slot and the WP 8 operating system still having some quirks which hopefully will be fixed at the end of June when the official version of WP 8.1 is released. The worst issue is when you first start your phone you will be disappointed with heat levels at the top of the back cover and horrible battery life. The solution is to shut your phone off, turn it back on and set it to airplane mode for a few minutes, then go to normal mode and you will see improvements. I did that twice and never had these issues again. Battery life is also hindered by the built in ""battery saver"" app. It seems to use more power checking to see if the battery is low than it saves when the battery is actually low. These are operating system problems widely reported and not the fault of the phone.Despite the issues and the lack of an Opera browser or any browser that isn't just wrapped around IE, at this point I still favor this device over any Android phone.",13,4
Nokia,So far I have no complains about this phone. It is just efficient...I love the windows platform I am a title closer and it makes retrieving documents on the road so easy. Pretty efficient. The camera lenses are off the chain!!!,18,5
Nokia,"Before I purchased I contacted the seller to make sure the version he sells is for US T-mobile and will enable 4G LTE. The box I got was a Tmobile box, it even included a microSIMcard. I have had it for a week now and I am getting 4g LTE speeds and everything seems to be working very well! I am so happy about my purchase from an Amazon seller, because the price was $200 less regular price for T-mobile customers. Just make sure you ask the seller directly which version it is - there are 3 versions of Lumia 925: RM-892 (international), RM-893 (US version for Tmobile and AT&T), RM-910 (asia version with no 4G) (source: Wikipedia). I got the RM-893 and 4G LTE works great on T-Mobile.",14,5
Nokia,"The product arrived in a worn and scuffed unsealed Verizon box more akin to Open Box than new and was defective as well. After hours of effort (including a long stretch with Microsoft) it was clear the device would not properly update; could sync my account; and was barely even functional as a feature phone. In fact, even on that level, the Gorilla Glass was not tightly fit along the base and the speaker buzzed when someone was speaking. Long and short of it is this was sold as new but was defective old stock in unsealed original packaging. It has already been shipped back to the vendor. I have owned a 928 for nearly two years and it is a great phone - this unit was not and I consider the vendor's add to be misleading at best.",10,1
Nokia,"Be warned: you are not buying a ""new"" phone here. I bought mine from the seller named ""STEWART MARKETING"". The phone was advertised as new, in sealed packaging. What I received was generic Nokia packaging with no mentioning of the actual device model (the box just says ""Nokia Mobile Device"" on it, and looks nothing like those nice boxes you see in YouTube ""unboxing"" videos for this phone). I then entered ##634# and saw the Lifetime counter at 1:50:34, meaning my device WAS ALREADY USED by someone else. I can see no scuffs or scratches as the other reviewer here, but the power supply I received with the phone is worn dirty, and the USB cord is covered with a messy white substance. All this makes me think it is a factory refurbished device (it looks like a factory refurb and not like a repackaged used unit), but what it certainly isn't is new.Also the listed specs are wrong for this phone; it does NOT support the many LTE bands advertised, and ONLY works at 3G speeds with AT&T SIM card.Now the device itself is another matter; it's nice and dandy. The Windows Phone 8.0 OS is just meh (can't even adjust brightness quickly without going into the app menu and settings), but the latest update should bring it to WP8.1, which is very nice and very usable.",43,3
Nokia,"This phone, in and of itself, is a great phone. However, It's an unlocked phone from Verizon that I wanted to use with my AT&T service. Everything works great except I cannot send or receive mms texts (picture texts and group texts). So words of warning to AT&T users who want an unlocked phone - don't purchase a Verizon phone - unlocked or not. I have searched through every forum trying to find apn codes that will work, but nothing has. I've handed over my phone to my IT folks at work, who end up try the same things that I've already tried so they don't get anywhere either. I took the phone to an AT&T store and they couldn't get it to work, even after giving me a new SIM card.Now I'm looking at spending more money on another new phone ... sigh.But other than the issues above, the cameras are great, flash is great, web browsing is great, and I love Cortana on the 8.1 update.",29,4
Nokia,"I wanted a durable simple phone to replace my smartphone. I am not a huge fan of smartphones. I just want a phone to do what a phone is supposed to do - call and text! This phone is straightforward and simple to use. The buttons are big, and are easy to push without pushing more than one at a time. It is a step above a plain phone; it has a calender and allows the creation of a ""to-do list"" - I don't use it, but I'm sure it would come in handy for someone. It's design is sleek and easily slips into my pocket. The back of the phone is metal, and so far has been goof-proof! It has already endured 2 drops. The entire bottom of the phone is a speaker. The speaker is loud and has a little bass to it. The two megapixel camera is decent, it's a little shaky - but that may just be me. The light show on it is pretty cool too. It gets good reception, and is loud and clear... a big problem I encountered with my iPhone. All-in-all I love this phone! If you're looking for a great flip phone that is durable and easy to use I would definitely recommend this product!",58,5
Nokia,"This is my second Mural because I love it so much. Yes, it does have its glitches but it's the best-non smartphone out there. Texts, takes nice photos and video, holds a removable memory card. The removable back plate is stainless steel but the rest of the body is sliver plastic. I wish Nokia would make MORE phones available in the US for less than $500. I should buy like 5 of these so i can have one forever.It's only exterior flaw is the button that holds the back plate on where the battery access is. The button is easily moved out of place and lets the back plate fall off, but I know that about this phone and I check it all the time as I put it in my pocket. Easily doable considering how great this thing is.It's only operational flaw is, when your SMS texting Inbox/Sent box gets real full, the phone will crash when you try to ""delete all items by folder."" So the workaround is to ""mark all,"" ""move to folder,"" then in the destination folder ""mark all"" again and THEN delete. Or, remember to delete messages when they stack up. Or delete groups of messages by marking 30-40 at a time. I think the phone's internal memory can't handle deleting more than 200 msgs at once.",11,5
Nokia,"For starters, I love the Nokia product. I've tried other brands of cell phones and have kept coming back to Nokia. The Mural 6750 is quick and easy to learn with simple steps to get to menus. I love the calendar function as well as the To-Do function!!I love the fact that when I've missed a call or text, the phone color fades in and out! When I walked into the store to get my old one replaced (after 3 years, the speaker went out), the employees laughed and said it wasn't made anymore & tried to talk me into a SmartPhone. I'm not dumb but I didn't want or need (nor wanted to pay extra for a data package) a phone that is smarter than I am.I walked out of there with a different type of flip phone and couldn't stand it. I ended up on Amazon & purchased another Mural!! I just hope that when this one takes a dive, I can still get another one!!",30,5
Nokia,"I bought this phone as a replacement for another one of my wife's dead Motorola razor phones.Having gotten tired of replacing another Motorola piece of junk I decided to get her a phone made by Nokia because I have always had Nokia phones for myself and love their reliability and endurance.I was not sure what to expect with this phone due to the low sale price but I would do it all over again.This phone has great reception and clarity,and my wife likes the option of changing the color of the outside light.The only problem with it is the difficulty in latching the back cover properly,but at least it's made of metal unlike the cheap plastic found on many of the Motorola phones.The battery life could also be improved some but it's sufficient if you don't keep playing with the colored lights.",21,4

Nokia,"Just received it this week. Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model, the photos are much better (both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses, but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the N90). Also, the N73 covers all radio bands, making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae). The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular, so depending on the city I was in, I occasionally had very spotty coverage. The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90, and best of all, it is much more compact than the N90, fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket. Last, there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone, protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?). As usual, the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera, but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds.",27,5

Nokia,"Normally when a 3G-capable Nokia is advertised by Amazon as being the U.S. version, that means it is designed to operate on the North American 3G networks. Sadly that is not the case with this phone. It is not 3G-capable in North America. The only thing U.S.-oriented about it is the warranty and the charger. I was hoping that the ""Asia/Europe 3G compatibility"" in the description was a leftover from the non-U.S.-model description, but after receiving one I can verify that that statement is accurate.Very disappointing.Come on, Nokia, where is our real U.S. model?",13,3

Nokia,"Absolutely beautiful phone with an amazing OS. The swipe to multitask and swipe to close is so natural that you will find yourself trying to do it on other OS's (iOS and Android) and becoming frustrated as its not as smooth and you have to press buttons...Overall the OS is buttery smooth and the visuals are beautiful.Pros:* Beautiful device* 1GB of RAM* OS is Fast - has been optimized and it shows from the speed of using the device* Swiping from a movie playing is a total wow moment* OS is beautiful and a joy to use, integrated accounts are awesome* Swiping feels natural for Multitasking and closing applications* Battery is great (at least 1 full day on a charge depending on usage)* Screen looks amazing, colours and brightness are great.

Nokia,"This phone is something special...extraordinary, even. I've owned or seen many wonderfully designed products (Apple's included) but the N9 exists on a whole different plane of beauty and elegance. I didn't buy it for the functionality (apps are everything for smartphones, and only Apple's iOS or Android win here), I bought it for its design.Unlike every other phone on the market (save Nokia's own Lumia phones), this thing exists and feels as one piece. It is carved out of a single polycarbonate (plastic) block, and the entire front face of the phone is the screen, covered by a sheet of Corning Gorilla glass that curves down slightly towards the edges, so that it sits flush with the phone's body. There's not a single hard edge anywhere, no small crevices, no screws. Nothing else out there feels as exquisite in the hand!And the screen is the second most important thing. Yes, it's not as dense pixel-wise as Apple's iPhone 4 (300 pixels per inch). But it comes quite close, at 256 ppi, which is still far higher than any television or computer screen out there. And the color and contrast! If you've ever looked at some of Samsung's high-end Android phones or tablets, you've seen the amazing color vibrancy and punch of their screens. Well this phone uses the same technology, and the colors pop, and the black is truly black. It is stunning, and I prefer it over the screens that Apple uses.Third, the OS. It's every bit as intuitive as Apple's, and I believe it improves upon it in many ways. There's only one gesture you really have to learn besides tapping, and that's swiping. There's no physical or virtual home button, and no little tray of icons at the bottom of the screen. It's just a grid of colorful icons that you scroll through vertically. To find or change to any apps you currently have open, you simply swipe to the right, and you see them all in card view. To get back, just swipe to the left. Nokia has their own font they've designed, and I like it better than any other font I've seen designed for the screen.Another crucial factor with smartphones is battery life. I don't use my N9 real intensely (like listening to a lot of music, or watching movies) and I'd say I average a little more than a day's worth of use per full charge. I use mine on AT&T's network and I've had no problems whatsoever. Gmail works great with the mail app. Browsing the web is a smooth, pleasant experience. I've put my own pictures, music, and documents on it from my iBook G4 over USB, without any extra software. It takes good pictures, but struggles in low-light. The keyboard is also an important factor, and this one is great. I tend not to like typing on the small onscreen keyboards all smartphones have, but this one is bearable, almost enjoyable. With the recent Meego update, a Swipe keyboard is also included. There are social apps included (Facebook, Twitter) but I don't really use them (though, from the once I've used it, the Facebook app is quite attractive.)For those like myself, who truly appreciate superb design, flawless execution, and impeccable build quality, the Nokia N9 will surpass your expectations!",15,5
Nokia,"Great stuff:- top-notch design -- N9 looks amazingly good (to me it looks better than newer iPhones)- excellent manufacturing quality- excellent phone component (better than iPhone with AT&T; I'm getting a very good reception in places where iPhone repeatedly failed with AT&T network)- works with both AT&T and T Mobile- superior swipe technology (also better than on Nokia Win platform too)- integrated social networks- 64 GB- much more ROM for processing apps (I was running out of ROM on N8 with maybe a dozen or so themes and maybe a dozen of downloaded apps)- excellently implemented *Dashboard* concept that shows important stuff (appointments, missed phone calls, new emails, etc)Good stuff:- solid camera (but N8 was better in that respect and so is newer iPhone)- easy setup- easy email setup if you have a GMAIL account(s) (for private Hotmail use N9's Exchange server setup and it works great since MS put the Active sync))- WiFi has a solid range- new Linux-based MeeGo OS is pretty good ... even excellent (but I think most people will find iOS and Android either easier or more intuitive)- over-the-air or cloud sync works very well (and better be since Nokia is shutting down some services and N9 is incompatible with Nokia Suite)- battery life seems to be OK (about same as an average iPhone with a few power saving enabled and the BT off)Bad stuff:- if you are addicted to collecting various apps, N9 is either not for you or it could be a cure for your addiction. While most of the things that a typical user will ever want to use are covered through Nokia Store apps (most of them are free), the Spartan system rules N9 compared to iOS and Android.- no memory expansion slot (think about 64GB instead of 16GB version when ordering)- no user-replaceable battery (same as iPhone)- incompatible with Nokia Suite (use Nokia Link that I found only marginally or minimally useful since it doesn't sync contacts or calendars)- Nokia killing some nice *convenience* services that makes you wonder if their commitment to Windows Mobile platform is going to leave behind some long-time Nokia fansOverall a great product from Nokia, even superb if your main thing is to use this device mainly for phone calls, check email, do some light social networking. If you are more into entertainment on your phone then stick with iPhone or an Android-based phone. If you plan to switch phones, make sure your current phone is using the microSIM card or you'll need to get one from your cell provider or use the cutter. If you are switching from a 4G or newer AT&T iPhone than you already have microSIM.",49,5
Nokia,"Let's just get this out of the way right now. The Nokia N9 is the most beautiful phone hardware I've ever owned. Not a surprise, as only Nokia and Apple churn out engineering this elegant. I'm somewhat of a phone junky, as I've owned most of the headliner phones from the major OS's: iPhone 4s, galaxy s2, galaxy nexus, Samsung focus, etc.Hardware: I'm typing this on my iPad, so don't have the typing patience to get too much into this, but wow this hardware is elegant. The curved screen complements the swipe os perfectly, the unibody construction is so well out together, the large generous speaker on the bottom provides plenty of volume, and the clear black screen really does provide such a vivid picture that icons look like they're floating on the screen. But really, you have to hold this phone to appreciate it. The old king of design (iPhone 4s) has been supplemented.One more thing on hardware, and this was huge for me. The antennae on this phone is pure Nokia, I.e. excellent. Typically, I have difficulty getting signal in many places in San Francisco with AT&T, but the N9 keeps a signal everywhere I go. In the east bay in the hills where my iPhone and nexus routinely would lose signal the N9 has 2-4 bars. It's really amazing.Software: the Meego experience is simple and effective, and I love it. Before Meego, my favorite OS was WP7. To be clear, when I rate an os, personally I'm excluding available software (ie apps). The reason is I'm thinking of the engineering and the thought out into the OS design, not how many developers chose to support it. I'm not saying apps are not important, far from it, but the number of available apps is so individually relevant (or not so) to the Individual user you have to decide how important that is to you.Much like wp7, Meego provides most used functionality with the minimal amount of screen interaction. Close an app, slide down. Switch an app, swipe right. Get notifications, swipe left. Minimize an app, swipe up. That's it. Simple, effective, and gorgeous.The N9 also comes with an incredible amount of connectivity out of the box. Gmail, exchange, Picasa, Dropbox, skype, twitter, Facebook, and more. I especially love how Skype is built in. Make calls and message directly from within the app.Battery: my only gripe with the phone. With everything enabled (especially gtalk, Skype, and Facebook chat) the battery is done after 12 hours of light usage. Start using the phone and youre down to 8 hours...that's is horrible. When you're NOT logged in to the messaging apps, battery shoots up to 2-3 days of light usage, and 16 hours of heavy, which is brilliant. Im not sure if this imitedto a few vocal N9 users, or if this all phones, but this is my experience.Summary: if you don't need a lot of external software, but need a heavily reliable phone that does mail, messaging, camera, Skype, music and video brilliantly, it is amazing. If you need more, definitely take a look at the lumia 900. It's not out yet, but supposedly has the same hardware design with a great os as well.",41,4
Nokia,"I've had this phone for a little over a week now, and I like it more and more everyday. There was an element of frustration at first...Gmail doesn't seem to want to play nice with Meego. Even some of the workarounds wouldn't help my mail and contacts to sync. Maps would freeze, Drive wouldn't load, and there was a few other hair-pulling frustrations.So why five stars? Well, most of my frustrations were fixed. Peruse the pages of the Meego forum and you'll find a lot of answers to tech problems. The N9 user community is very helpful. Also, the phone itself makes the tech woes dissipate from utter user-joy: the screen is incredible, a joy to look at. The N9 UI is the most intuitive touch screen experience I have ever used. The indicators on the lock screen are smart. I can't believe more smart phones don't use the same approach to indicators.I'm using my N9 on T-mobile, and while I seem to have fewer signal bars overall, I have fewer dropped calls. I can even talk on my N9 in my basement, which I couldn't do with my Sprint phone. Whether or not it's because T-mobile has a superior signal, or whether it's because the N9 has a better antenna -- I dunno.Some have said that the Ovi store has a paltry selection, but I've found everything I need and more. Sure, it's no Google play, but how many light saber and fart apps does a phone need?Admittedly, the battery is wanting. If you have a bunch of background apps running, it'll be toast in one day or less. But if you tweak your settings, you'll easily get at least two days with moderate usage.So, it's a phone I recommend. Even with all the baggage of the various tech problems (which are fixable), the poor battery, and the fact that Nokia will quit supporting it after 2014 (might need a new phone by 2015 anyway) it's still worth it. You know you have an awesome phone when the associates at T-mobile and best buy ogle it with ""wows"" and ""where did you get that?"" The N9 is like a pretty girl - she's worth fighting for.",23,5
Nokia,"I ordered this a few weeks ago and was really excited about receiving it. Coincidentally the day before my N95-4 arrived, Nokia released a new firmware update so the first thing I did was update the software on my N95-4 to the latest version.During the update process I noticed the USB port on the phone itself seemed loose but thought nothing of it. After the update was done I began to use the phone and I ended up returning it to Amazon the next day! You've seen all the positive reviews, so I won't rehash that, but here are why I returned it:- The USB port on my N95-4 was extremely loose or broken. You had to apply a lot of pressure and push the cable in and then not touch it for it to stay connected. It was so loose that a breeze from the window could disconnect the device from the PC. I tried several USB cables, computers/ports with no success.- The USB transfer speed is HORRIFIC for a device that comes with 8GB. It took almost 2.5 hours to transfer about 4GB of music to the device using Windows Media Player. Using mass storage mode is just as slow since this uses USB 2.0 Full-Speed (old spec) not USB 2.0 High-Speed (common today). No matter what people tell you this is absolutely frustrating and annoying over time, even if you don't transfer stuff much.- The slider on the phone is wobbly and whenever I pressed a button on the keypad it made a creaking sound that I don't expect from a $600 phone. It did not feel solid at all, at least not my N95-4- The overall size of the device is surprisingly small but the thing is as thick as a brick which makes it awkward to carry in your pant pocket or worse jeans pocket.- Even without really installing any apps on it the thing would randomly slow down and not respond to key presses and then just ""wake up"" all of a sudden it was bizarre.- Does not charge via USB. Not used to this so was annoying that you have to at times have both a USB cable and Nokia charger plugged in.I ended up getting a Nokia N78 (US 3G) that was just recently released and I'm extremely happy with it. It addresses most if not all of the issues I had with the N95-4 including fastest USB, fast CPU/responsive, excellent build quality.I would recommend looking at the N78 or the upcoming N96 (successor to N95) over the N95-4.",22,3
Nokia,"The N95 has to be the best all around device. Everything works well. It's hard to imagine a device that small has all the modern day gadgets built in: Phone, GPS, Wi-Fi, bluetooth, 3G, Camcorder, and a fine camera. The N95 is quality built (unlike many high end Korean phones) with a very clear high res. screen. Battery life is excellent. I only wish the 8G device has an expandable storage like the non-8G models. I ordered from Amazon with one-day delivery and it arrived on time. Highly recommended to those who want an all around device that works. Set up is bit complicated but it's a complicated device. Be patient! Nokia website has good support. The software however is bit buggy for Vista-64 but works fine with XP. I spent a day setting up the N95. Once working, it's a small wonder. I also have an iPhone and the Nokia has far more features and is a better phone, esp. it's unlocked so that I can use it overseas - this restriction on the iPhone is the worst thing to an otherwise a great device of its kind. The N95 is well worth the $660 price!",13,5
Nokia,"It's a nice little phone. The one I had just had a few bugs to work out. The battery I got in this first one did not last as long as the second one I received. The voice command on this first one was jinxed. About one out of 20 names I would say would 1st pick a wrong name, (which can be expected) but then would commence to shutting itself off and then restart. If I said the same name, it would do it consistently. Like I said it would do it on about 5% of the names. I called Nokia of the problem and ordered one from them because it was so new, and I wanted one made in Finland as Stu promised. It was also from China. The video and photos aren't near as good as I expected. They were OK if taken in bright light. I want a qwerty pad. So I am going to wait for the N97 coming out in June or July 09. The N96 locked up on me about twice a day, especially if I was doing heavy internet chores, (on wifi). Sometimes if I would just wait it would catch up. But if it was in the middle of something and I got bored waiting I would try to back out and do something else and it was too much for the little thing to absorb so it would lock up. At this point I would have to remove the battery to get it to reset itself. And the release and the little catchs on the rear cover are sort of chincy and it didn't feel like the rear cover would last very long removing the battery so often.It's nice to have the tv out cable ability but the stuff we record does not play back as well as a 99MB travel piece that they have for us to playback. This tells me that they record that on a good camera and downloaded it into the phone. I could get the predictive text shut off on some things but not on the internet browsing. I would have to enter letters til the thing told me to spell the word myself, which I wanted in the first place.On the toggle buttons for the volume, they're OK but the volume goes up one way so you would think that when the buttons are used for zooming that to zoom in would be the same direction as the volume increase. Nope. While this is not a big deal It just takes a bit more memorization. The screen shuts off way too fast, (to save battery). This can be reset but that poor battery doesn't like this new setting. The second N96 I got seemed to last longer with the battery.If I wanted to hear the sound out of the speakers I would have to shut my bluetooth off. The screen protectors are good just make sure you have every piece of dirt and lint of the screen before install it or it will make a bubble around the piece of dirt.The thickness of the phone did not bother me either.I thank Amazon very much for having a place for these reviews. I read them all the time before I purchase anything.",10,3
Nokia,"For those who don't want to renew your contract, this is a wonderful unlocked GSM phone with quite a lot of feature at a very reasonable price.Before I get started, there is one point to keep in mind. This is an unlocked phone. There is some configuring that has to be done in order to get internet and MMS working with your provider. Nokia used to have a site that would send carrier specific info to the phone, but I believe they have taken it down. You may have to search forums and/or call your carrier customer support for this one. Call and SMS will work ""out of box"", but anything internet dependent will require some fiddling.On to the review.I have found for a $140 phone, this pretty much does everything I'd want a basic cell phone to do, almost to the point where I don't really care about have a higher end smart phone.Call quality is great and I have found that the Series 40 UI far easier to use than most of the carrier locked phones we have in the UI. If you're using an ATT or TMO Nokia phone, you are not experiencing the full potential that Nokia has to offer.Nokia's email client is great for basic email checking and even without 3G data capabilities, I found EDGE data speeds more than sufficient. With T9 predictive entry, even sending basic reply messages is relatively quick.The media player keys are a handy touch, and the FM radio is also a nice additional feature. Overall, I found Nokia's generic media player much more pleasant than that of most other low end phones.Onto some cons...I have accidentally hung up on some calls as the screen tends to stick to my face and if I keep moving my hand, I will eventually slide the phone far enough to cause the call to end.There is no feature to auto-lock the keys when the slider is closed. You either have to select the ""Lock"" option immediately after closing the slide or enable the auto keyguard feature to lock after a set amount of time. This is kind of a vestige of Nokia's candy bar only phone days.No Nokia Maps. Even though this phone has no GPS, it's nice to still look up maps when you're in a bind. I've used several other S40 phones with this feature(with and without GPS) and although it's no Google Maps or Nokia Navigation, for such an inexpensive phone, it's good enough.Overall, for the price, you will get a lot. If you're looking for a basic unlocked phone sans contract, this is the phone for you. You may even be pleasantly surprised.",46,4
Nokia,"This phone is amazing. I have had this phone for about a month and it is all that I hoped it would be. I go to the gym daily and it was cumbersome taking my mp3 player and my cell phone to work out. Now, with his Nokia, I just grab it and go. I have my phone and an MP3 player all in one. I love it.",33,5
Nokia,"Got this phone today. Right out of the box it appeared impressive, pleasing to eye and touch. Tried to get the back cover off according to the manual's instructions but it was no go. Finally I got my jeweler's screw driver out to try prying around the edges. Fortunately without damage, I've discovered what the manual omitted from their instructions. You have to pry up, gently, the lower back case with a blade or tiny screw driver before pushing down and sliding it out. The bottom part of the cover has two prong like tabs which will prevent you from sliding it until you pry it up first. Having survived this part of the struggle then I proceeded to install the simm card and battery. Looking at the manual again I tried to flip up the simm door and it just fell out. It appears the simm door was already damaged and was just pressed in there hoping to pass for the sale. So I never got past this part and requested a return RMA label from Amazon. The simm door and back cover definitely could use a more robust design. In my humble opinion, while this phone offers lots of pleasing features, Nokia dropped the ball.It's going to be returned via UPS tomorrow for full refund.",28,2
Nokia,"I have always been a NOKIA fan for its long lfe batteries, strong & sturdy encasements and signal reception. This time I was making a maiden purchase of a Unlocked phone in US.Over a year I have seen innumerable Smart Phones of different makes & of different statements for individuals but I wondered how many of us actually need a Smart Phone.Do you need to browse google map while driving on a FreeWay??..In 24 hrs we are connected to internet for 18 hrs either thru laptops,desktops,tablets OR ubiquitious phones. Hence, I thought..lets give it a break.I needed a phone which was presentable, strong & capable to many activitied at the same time not provocative to my restless fingers. Lot of brands offer multiple phones..at range of $110-$200 & they are all basically entery level advanced phones..after evaluating all others for their look, style, comaptibility & speed NOKIA was again undisputable choiceX3-02 is Sleek, Slim, Super Battery life, Awesome Display & Camera...& Quite sufficient for those who do not need data plans( OR Free Way plans :) ) but are happy with Wi-Fi at hotspots/home..This phone is For you..You can watch Youtubes,work on Facebooks & likes..( although display might not be comparable to iPhone)Do not compare to Smart phones of Apple,Samsung or > $200 range..if you like superfast,high resolution GUI & Apps go for iPhone..This Phone is not for you",57,4
Nokia,"Pros:- It's nice and compact. Light weight too, so it fits easily in a shirt pocket.- Very good voice call quality. As good as my iPhone 4.- Decent battery life. What a breath of fresh air when compared to the power sucking smartphones that have brought in the age of cellphone cases with battery packs. The initial charge on this Nokia led to a standby time of over a week. Now, it averages about 3-4 days between charges. This is with mild use since I use my iPhone more.- Quite a configurable user interface.- It has a immediate screen locking button to prevent inadvertent activity via the touch screen.Cons:- I'm not convinced the touch screen really improves usability and was likely included as a gimmick to improve sales or potential buyer interest.- The touch screen is just ... OK. The sensitivity is just acceptable and I often end up selecting items while trying to scroll.- Unfortunately, some features are accessible only via the touch screen. I wish this weren't the case but....- Working with the address book can be tedious since I can search only via the first or last names depending on how you choose to list names, i.e., first then last as opposed to last then first.Overall, it's a pretty good phone. I purchased it since I didn't need two smartphones and it has delivered in its light weightedness, simplicity and longer battery life. However, I can't say that I'm impressed with the touch screen feature. I'm happy to see that simpler phones are still in circulation. The smartphone craze and general feature overkill are getting out of hand.",11,3
Nokia,Nokia doesn't allow this phone (US product code) to update its firmware so you're stuck with what was put on when the phone first came out including all its bugs. There have already been two new firmware releases from the firmware my handset states and Nokia's US website even says the phone needs to be updated but it wont update.,11,2

Nokia,"Like many others, I have been a long time fan of Nokia phones, they are not always the most high end of phones like the current Iphone or androids but I myself dont really need to carry around a $400 dual-core processor android phone all day. That's what my laptop is for! I have gone through many phones with T-mobile and the prices of phones just get more expensive and they are just cheesy phones, In my opinion. When I first saw this phone I knew it was love at first sight. Something about the simplicity of the candy bar style design of nokia phones just intrigues me, especially with the design of this new x3 touch and type. Its refreshingly new and sleek. and almost as slim as my 4g Ipod touch which makes it easy to carry around in your pocket with no hassle. not like all those other heavy touch screen phones that mimic the Iphone. Its almost weightless, yet heavy enough to remind you of the quality. The quality of the touch screen is not high definition by any means, but very good considering it's a Nokia. Being able to text with the keypad and use the touch screen to navigate through menus and settings and such is a perfect combination on this phone. You really have to hold it in your hand to experience it. And its a nokia so the battery life is awesome of course. I read a few bad reviews on this phone before I bought it, but if your looking for a simple yet smart little phone that is very easy to use and reliable then this nokia is the phone for you! Anyone who likes the touchscreen feature but doesnt need all those apps and useless programs on the newer phones this is your phone!!!",17,5
OnePlus,"Almost 4 yrs with smartphones - had Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, then Samsung Galaxy S4 and now Oneplus Two(64 GB-Black). Got an invite from my friend and then decided to buy it. With it for around 3 days and loving it. It's super power house - octa core processor with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage with no bloat ware. I had some tough time to decide among this, Moto X Pure Edition and Asus Zenphone 2 - this time I was in no mood to buy $750-$800 Samsung or Apple. I paid around $406(no tax but around $17.xx as S&H fees). It arrived within a week from China.Pros:1) Very smooth screen2) Very powerful phone - very smooth in operation.3) Metallic edges - so looks premium quality.4) Voice, music and speakerphone of good quality.5) Camera - 13 MP and 5 MP..not top of the line but still good enough. Good laser auto focus and overall good quality6) Very good size battery - easily lasting for more than a day. For me battery is very important - a phone should be smart in terms of battery usage.7) Android Lollipop is very good.8) Improvement over oneplus1 as same screen but phone size is reduced. I am able to do one hand operation9) Android/Oxygen has very good default features OOTB.10) wifi connection and signals better than my Samsung Galaxy S4.11) Most of the stuff like setting up AT&T was done by it's own...i don't have to do anything at all.Cons:1) Charger is different than regular USB charger...so you need to carry your own-can't borrow other's.2) It's not a major improvement over oneplus one at least in terms of features.3) Missing NFC, Quick charge and could have better camera, quick charge at least.4) Support sucks...sometimes on chat - it says more than 26 hours of wait time...though you will be able to get to them in around 30-45 minutes.5) Just too much responsive...they have placed - air plane mode button which sometimes is getting touched a bit while in the call...which disconnects...sort of annoying...it's very sensitive and fast phoneOverall it's a very good phone at least price wise. Won't be going back to Apple or Samsung in future as more or less there are some really good options available in sub $400 range now.Update on July 2016.On 4th June 2016 there was a 1.1 GB update of this phone. After that no ring on the incoming calls.After June update I don't have ring for incoming calls. Any time any app is getting updated then also ringtone goes away. Tried everything, I was not not knowing the twitter support is good...at least somebody is there is there to respond. The email support and phone support sucks for OnePlus in USA though phone support for OnePlus is good in india. Also india service centers are very good...I was travelling to India for Work and vacation during June and first half of July, 2016. I called Customer Service and was able to talk to Mr. Mohan Kumar who assigned it the case # 301052.Followed all the tricks on each and every forum...but any app which is getting updated..i am having nightmares with this phone not having ring for incoming calls...i am too busy and any such missed call is really very problematic. Tried this one: try performing the below mentioned troubleshooting steps?1.Settings > Sound & notification > Phone ringtone > Select ""OnePlus tune"".2. Settings > Sound & notification > Default notification ringtone > Select ""Free"".Once it works, please change the desired ringtone from the setting again. and also reboot-->Volume Down-->wipe cache data with priority notification in middle. But nothing worked for me. I disabled all the apps auto update also but no success. I am suffering for around 2 months now. Work/life and everything is impacted - if some smart phone feature doesn't work then it's fine but if the basic phone - calling and receiving is not working then it's a big issue. Other issue the phone's battery is really getting weak..now it lasts only 6 hours...when it was new it used to go upto 10-11 hours but now it's not lasting beyond 6 hours. As the battery is not replaceable it causes issues. As there is no fast charging for this phone - i need to charge it for full 2.5 hours to get 85% of the battery. I need to carry the charger everywhere as the battery performance is going down. At jaipur india - the support fixed the volume button otherwise the phone was not even booting up. Never had this much headache with any phone. Now finally Oneplus accepted the fault and ready to repair...which may take 3 weeks...so i need to look for alternate phone(oneplus not ready for loner phone also)...simply put in least words...oneplus messed up big time with the update - no testing done prior to update...worst their support is not at all good in usa..customer is very much on their own with these kind of phone...not at all a flagship killer according to me.Update on 8th Aug 2016.I finally sent this phone for repair. Both the sides shipping was taken care of by OnePlus. It took 2.5 weeks for me to get back the phone - they don't offer any loner phone. I asked them only two things :1) for incoming calls it should ring 2) Battery is getting discharged very easily. Too my surprise nothing has been repaired. The repair center in Florida is good for nothing - they didn't even tested the phone and sent it back...still no ring for incoming calls. Called OnePlus support at the us number (646) 851-2228 - call gets routed to china where you can hear a lot of background noise...these folks are once again asking me to send this phone for repair which might take another 2.5 or 3 weeks. With no trust on this company and this device - i asked them politely to refund or send me a replacement device...they said talk to corporate office in Schenzen, China. they don't have any email id for them and moreover it should be them who should have done that...i have given up on this hyped chineese toys which is good for nothing...in india they say that chineese products cannot be trusted...so now i understand where they are coming from. OnePlus please stop making phones and definitely hire smart capable repair folks and customer service also.update on 26th Aug 2016Sent this device for repair twice to them - first time to Florida and then to Texas address but none of the time it was fixed. Worst thing - you need to ship your phone and be away from phone for 2.5 to 3 weeks...every time I send them the details about the problem and it's the same problem-that there is no incoming ring tone when somebody calls me. After 2.5 or 3 weeks it will be shipped back to you without any notice. In case of oneplus support - twitter, email, phone support doesn't talk to each other...none of them are aware what is going on...first time they did the factory reset and then second time re-installed the Operating system. But the problem is not resolved. How come a O/S upgrade can screw up the ring for incoming calls...that is beyond imagination...clearly they have messed up big time with their O/S rather than using pure Android O/S....this is ridiculous state of customer service/support.NEVER EVER BUY ANY PHONE FROM THIS COMPANY....YOU WILL END TALKING TO SOME FOLKS WHO ONLY SPEAKS ENGLISH IN MANDARIN WAY.",30,1
OnePlus,"As usual, the star rating has let me down, but if I had my choice, I'd give this phone 2.5 stars.Overall:OnePlus sells this phone as the 'flagship killer', with it's impressive display, camera, and low price point, it seems to hit the nail on the head. It seems as if OnePlus has truly tried to make a great phone, as technically there's no downside to this devise as opposed to many other flagships. Starting the phone up you immediately notice the display. It's sharp and crisp and appears bigger and better than most screens I've experienced. Unlike most modern phones, there's a pretty large gap between the top and bottom of the screen and the phone itself; however the symmetry of the gap makes it look sleek, not awkward. The buttons on the side of the screen feel good in your hand, as does the coarse matte-black back. The UI which comes preinstalled is one I was semi-familiar with, and the preset settings don't seem invasive. OnePlus touts the camera to be best-on-market, and I see no reason to disagree. The lens seems to zoom and focus precisely and quickly. Compared to other phones I've had (G3,MotoX,Nexus5), this camera takes the cake.Once I started to use the device more, I became less and less impressed. Within the first twenty minutes of being activated, the phone froze. Sure, I was installing an app while running another, but with the ""impressive qualcomm processor"" I figured this would be little issue. This was a true freeze, as the phone got increasingly hot and didn't respond for 60-seconds, I was forced to restart. I concluded that maybe it was doing things in the background as well, having been just set up, and that I'll take it easy for a while and return to the task.After setting up the phone to how I wanted it, I started heavily using the apps I always have. Many of them barely function at all, and prove a difficult task for the phone. Opening Snapchat freezes the phone for 20 seconds, some games immediately crash, and many things are slow or laggy. About once a day I have to force restart the phone because it froze switching apps or opening something. Additionally, because this is a '3rd party' phone, many apps are not optimized for it. the phone won't even load the GOOGLE WIDGET sometimes!!! The phone gets quite hot with just limited use. While the battery isn't BAD, it's not amazing either, and will not last more than a day, which is all that really matters.Overall, I have to give this phone a bad review. I'd been using a LG G3 for about two years and besides the screen, there's nothing the OnePlus does better. While the hardware seems to be stunning, it doesn't run smoothly and isn't taken advantage of in a way the user can admire. The screen freezing and slow performance compared to friends phones are insanely disappointing. I was so ready to show this phone off to all my friends and be a member of the $350 club, but showing it off, they all remarked on the same things I did (slowness, freezing, heat, awkward interfaces with the UI) within five minutes. We'll have to see what OnePlus can bring to the table next, but I was in no way impressed with this version.Pros:$350 price point puts it much cheaper than some of it's competitorsScreen is beautiful, lights up nicelyLooks great and feels amazing in the handCamera is one of the best on the mobile marketNeutral:Large space between the screen and phone borderBattery life on-par with competitorsGeneral call/antennae quality quite goodCons:Freezes under heavy workload, even as new deviceMany apps/widgets don't seem to work within the UIMay act particularly buggy/slow within many appsPhone becomes quite hot with prolonged use",75,3
OnePlus,"UPDATE: Since the Oxygen 3.0 (i.e., Marshmallow-based) update was pushed to my phone, system stability and performance have been greatly improved. Still some quirks, but this is much closer to the phone I thought I was purchasing. Revised from one star to three stars.____Earlier review:____Pros: purchase price, battery life, uh...Cons: Pretty much everything else.I bought this phone to replace a 2.5 year old Nexus 5 (2013), was which starting to get a little pokey for my taste. I would never have imagined that its late 2015 replacement would make my old Nexus 5 look like a speed demon.Laggy response in too many circumstances to name. Seems to stop responding to touch input for several seconds, then suddenly catches up and tries to process all your buffered inputs. Freezes and/or spontaneously reboots at least once every 72 hours. Massive color distortion in photos taken using any kind of digital zoom (sample attached).I hunted for tips to solve known bugs/issues. Found some that looked promising, but none were effective. Have owned the phone for just over a month, and my patience is pretty much gone. Did I just get a lemon? Maybe. But barring their monopoly takeover of the entire market, this is my first and last OnePlus purchase.",43,3
OnePlus,"I read the reviews on here before purchasing my product, I was almost tempted to not purchase it because of the negative reviews. The interesting part is regardless of the negative comments posted I have not experienced any of the things mentioned. I have absolutely love my phone and I am having a good experience with it overall.",26,5
OnePlus,"I love this phone. I'm glad I didn't go with the somewhat bigger Nexus 6; it just would have been too big for my hands, which aren't that small. Although the tempered glass screen protector it came with was chipped or cracked there was no actual damage to the phone itself. It's taken some getting use to because it is definitely bigger then my old Galaxy S4, but it was totally worth the switch. The UI is pretty easy to learn, and it didn't come with a ton of bloatware. Works perfectly on my Straight Talk network, via AT&T towers. Just had to get a nano SIM and register the card with the carrier online. Had to configure the data network to the right access port though, but I had to do it with the S4 so it wasn't a big deal. The reception is great, I can hear people on the other end of the line, and the features are fun to play with.Would I buy this again?YOU BET!!!",18,5
OnePlus,"I received a notification to update the OS. After installing this update, the phone did not reboot. I researched solutions for wiping cache, data and factory resets.After none of those worked, I contacted OnePlus customer service directly who gave me a literal copy and paste solution from a website that I'd already found.The only new solution they offered was to turn my phone off for 12 hours, charge it for another 6 hours, then reboot. I use my phone for work and family. This is completely unacceptable, but I did it (thank goodness I kept my old phone). Of course, this solution did not work.This inferior software and inadequate customer service is evidence of a substandard company. DO NOT BUY.",15,1
OnePlus,"It's a fantastic phone. I've read reviews stating that the fingerprint unlocking is slow or that the auto brightness adjustment is sluggish. I haven't found either of these to bother me. The fingerprint unlocking is very fast in my experience, and though the auto brightness adjustment takes a bit of time after the lighting conditions change, I actually perfer that. It's a gradual dimming or brightening versus a rapid brightness change, which is easier on my eyes.You may be more aware of the terms than I was, but there's a distinction between a rooted phone and an unlocked phone. This phone is unlocked in the sense that you're not stuck with a single cell phone carrier lke AT&T. However, the phone is not rooted. Unless you're specifically looking for a rooted phone it probably won't matter to you, but I figured I'd point it out since it confused me some till someone commented on my original review and pointed out the difference.",16,5
OnePlus,I got the the Chinese version. Don't believe the pictures!! I am extremely dissatisfied!! It doesn't even work with my carrier!! >:O !!!!!!!!!!!!,10,1
OnePlus,"If I could rate a device at less than 1 out of 5 I would ... here's why:First, this particular product is not the US version of the phone. The result is that it does not work on T-Mobile's LTE network. I returned it for a full refund - thanks to Amazon's excellent return policy.I went to One Plus One's website and bought directly from that company. I received a phone that was certainly the US market phone and worked correctly on T-Mobile's network, until ... it bricked itself during a normal over the air cyanogen update. And when I say ""brick"", I mean ""brick"": the screen went blank, the phone would subsequently not reboot to cyanogen. In fact, the phone would not boot to the fastboot loader using the correct button combination.All this happened while plugged in to a charger with a full charge on the battery.I immediately contacted One Plus One support and that's when the real tale of woe started:First they wanted me to shoot and send them a video of the phone. Obviously a meaningless task given it was dead. I pointed that out and asked they exchange the phone. Then they kept sending me the instructions on getting to fastboot. Of course, since that failed the first time, it failed the next n-times. They sent me a pointer to the OS for a reload - but that only works if you can get to fastboot (and I've used Android since its first release - also I've worked closely with Google on several versions of Android so I'm not exactly your average consumer). Finally they asked for photos of the phone to make sure it had not been dropped or soaked in liquid - front, back, all sides and inside with the back off.All photos were sent. At this point I had invested so much time in the phone that at even a modest hourly rate, my time cost had exceeded the phone's price. Having had an open mind about their hardware (I know that Cyanogen is stable and rock solid), now I began to doubt the company as well as the device. Clearly this is not a device to risk your personal communication on.So, given the fact there is a serious problem with the particular device, I asked for a refund. I've done this every two days in response to One Plus One's support people ignoring my request and wanting to engage me in debugging their bad hardware. The email stream is beyond reality given how they continue to ignore my request - and, after all, I am the customer and they have my money. I have a dead brick - which has no hope of any debug outside of a hardware lab.Eventually they asked for a copy of the receipt for the phone and I was hopeful that an RMA was in process for its return. However, that was not the case. The next email indicated that since I had ""not responded"" to previous emails, they were closing the support request. I wrote back and again it became the same ping pong match of me requesting my money back and they asking me to debug a dead device.I've now engaged PayPal in an investigation of the company and its failure to take a dead product back and refund my money. Only at this point did I decide to start writing customer reviews - and I have retained the entire email thread in case people have trouble understanding how bad One Plus One's support really is, not to mention its policy of avoiding exchanges or refunds. These people need to be exposed as they do not understand consumer support norms - the basic expectation that if a device dies within the first week of use, you either exchange it immediately or refund it.In parallel, a good friend of mine bought one of these phones, based largely on the fact that I bought one and he trusted my judgement. His phone is unreliable - non-working GPS, screen touch input is random at times, etc. When he contacted One Plus One, they refused to exchange the device or refund his money. They suggested he sell the device on ebay ... which of course he will not do as he would never knowingly sell a defected device to a 3rd party.I strongly advise avoiding this phone. It may look good from the outside but its build quality and component quality are clearly suspect. It is not a device to rely on for something as critical as personal communication. Add to that the company's failure to exchange or refund a dead device and you have a perfect storm - something best avoided.",48,1

OnePlus,"This phone is great, I went from a s***ty Samsung Grand Prime (I live in Brazil, thats why) and finnaly got this OnePlus device. For only a $400 price tag this phone blew my mind, im using for about 3 months and i got no trace of lag at all, the camera is awesome and the screen is spot on, we just need 1920x1080p on phones guys, you will not use phones for VR in the future, this tecnology was born outdated.We can say this phone at this price is definitely a gamechanger in cellphones market because comparing to the other flagship devices such as the iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge wich costs like $600-$800 this phone kicksass, ok, we cant compare low light photos with S7 but the camera on the OP3 is great too.",10,5
OnePlus,"This phone is great went from a Note 4 which was also a great phone but after 2 years started to crap out on me. For only a $400 price tag this phone is definitely worth considering and rivals alongside the other flagship devices such as the iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. This phone works phenomenally and I have yet to experience any lag. I don't know why all the tech reviewers are ragging on the camera when the outstanding photos, albeit low light is quite noisy. I also love the dash charging as I am able to get up in the morning do my routine and leave my phone charging for 30 minutes and have 90% battery and be ready to go about my day. I highly recommend this device.",45,5
Samsung,I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.,19,1

Samsung,"I ordered this item from seller Wireless Experts, Inc. and so far Im VERY happy with this purchase. The item was suppose to arrive on friday but actually came in 2 days early on Wed and all emails/questions were answered proptly from this seller. Still getting use to and trying everything out but so far no problems. The area i live in is mainly covered by AT&T (Southcentral KY and most of TN) which is why I chose this version of the galaxy so I could make sure it all worked. I use this phone with pre paid straight talk and have no issue, phone works and so does the 4G and 4G LTE internet is blazing fast. Ive had other friends buy other unlocked phones and have problems with 4G LTE off of the AT&T towers but being this is an AT&T version you shouldnt have any issue in areas covered by them (Or as in my case any pre paid service that works off the AT&T network like straight talk). One minor downside is even tho its unlocked all AT&T software/apps CAN NOT be uninstalled only disabled but for me its not a real big issue",48,4
Samsung,"Water insulation this offWater insulation is taken off in the port of loading, which is seen is of poor quality. It is one expensive equipment, must not have cosmetic defects. That means the phone is defective. It is no longer waterproof. The insulation should not took off. I doubt the originality of the phone.Roughly speaking it is acceptable medium, there are two details that I do not understand, the phone case is different from an original team of Samsung. The latter can not make video call. This should not happen. All Samsung Galaxy allow video calls.The phone is slow and takes time to implement commands, actually I cheated with this product.",45,1
Samsung,BlutekUSA I am very disappointed. BlutekUSA sent me a refurbished device. I am not happy. It came in the OEM box but didn't have any AT&T branding or specs outside. There is a crease at the bottom left corner of the screen. It seems as though the screen has been replaced. Whenever the touch keys are illuminated light is emitted from the crease. Got this unit at $329. Thought it was a deal but it was robbery. I demand a refund!,11,1
Samsung,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a fantastic phone, but the one I received from this seller was defective. I didn't find out until after it was activated, so this presents a big problem for me. The problem is that the it won't charge the battery. The first time it charged the battery to 40% and that is when I had to take it to the AT&T store to get it activated. When I returned home, I put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before I returned to get it. The phone was not charging, and it was 1% changed. I reset the phone and it charged again, when it got to 30%, I installed the update. I thought the update might fix the charging problem. After the update, the phone was reset while it finished installing, that all went fine. I saw that the phone was charging so I left it on the charger and went o sleep. When I returned, 7 hours later, it had stopped charging, and the phone was charged to 19%. So all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging. I also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone, but after it was trained, it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly. It was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print. I don't know if I should order another one of these phones, I am pretty sure they are refurbished phones, but they avoid saying that in the description.",12,1
Samsung,"Really disappointed. I had the S3 and bought this because I loved the camera and operating system of the S3, and the S5 is supposed to be better with higher spec. However, all the pictures I have taken on this new S5 have been quite blurry. This is highly inconvenient as I was planning on using this for pictures for my travels.The charging port does not work unless the charger is angled in a specific way, and this has been tested with multiple chargers.The heart rate monitor does not work.The phone tells me multiple times to make sure the back case of the phone is attached, when it is and even has a case around it to secure it.The speaker phone has issues where people cannot hear me but apparently has lots of feedback and noise. My temporary phone, a nokia lumia worth $40, did not have that issue.The phone itself is probably great, but this particular Galaxy S5 was not worth $365. Not worth the risk of getting a dud phone. Try another seller.I find myself wishing I had just fixed the cracked screen of my Samsung Galaxy S3 which I bought at Costco.",14,1

Samsung,"I am no a senior but I need the great call service because I have heart issues. I had the basic flip phone and it broke and being used to Android I found it too basic for me. So I purchased the smartphone so I could have the usual android experience. I used the advanced home screen but this phone also has a basic straight forward screen if you are new to smartphones. I transferred my service and like always the great call peeps were friendly and helpful and helped me get activated rather painlessly. The phone seems pretty good for 150 bucks and has a decent amount of memory for apps. The calling plans are very flexible and economical depending on how much you plan to use the phone. The coverage is good even in the country. The phone works well and shipping was fast thanks to Amazon prime. I think this would make a great first smartphone for seniors and the great call service is in my humble opinion so much better and more flexible than the I've fallen and can't get up button. The only downside is the lack of accessories, specifically screen protectors for it.",77,5

Samsung,"This phone, that is supposed to be geared for the elderly and their fixed income, has a quite expensive monthly plan! And it is not adaptable to any other servers like Verizon or Cricket or ATT. It's quite a disappointment. The phone itself seems nice but before you can really try it, you must buy into one of their plans. The advertising ""come-on"" is $18 a month, but call minutes are quite low. The ""normal"" plan considering minutes for calls is about $50 with this phone! I don't recommend this for seniors living on social security.",11,2
Samsung,"On the surface it looks great, meant for senior citizens, etc. In actuality there are a few flaws in the execution of the design.As many have pointed out, the volume will not go up very high. Many seniors have difficulty hearing and my mother could not hear it ""ring"" with any of the offered tones. I was able to solve that by downloading other ring tones using Zedge that had better volume than those offered with this phone.The case is totally black (looks gray in photo) and the keys on the bottom to go back, etc are very small & virtually impossible to see if you have impaired vision.The phone is very small and is clumsy for hands with arthritisNo hard or gel case available for protection, only those pouches. If you have arthritic hands it is difficult to get it out of the pouch to answer a call before it stops ringing. Those cases do not offer much protection and no other case will fit on the phones.The 5Star is there for emergency assistance, however, if you fall & have it in your hand chances are it's gonna break when you fall or you may be so injured that you cannot get it out of the pouch to push that button. I realize that it will dial automatically IF it senses a fall, I presume that only works if you do have it in your hand and it doesn't break in the fall.I wish I had been able to see and examine it before my mother bought it, very disappointed in the overall design. I think she regrets the purchase also.If you are a senior and want a ""smart phone"" there are better options & you can get 5Star without it. I would not recommend this to anyone.",33,1

There is no way to deactivate the button. I was nervous that my grandmother would accidently hit the pink 5 star button and then realize she was in the wrong place and accidently just hit the huge red call 911 button while trying to hit the home button to escape. This phone would have been great if we could have deactivated that button or at least the call 911 button. I just felt that she would have kept accidently hitting that 911 button. When I called Greatcall and added them about accidentally hitting the huge 911 button... They said it happens all the time and that the smaller should just remain on the line and let the police know it was an accident... I know my grandmother would panic and just hang up.",32,1
Samsung,I am very disappointed with this phone. While the phone may be okay no one mentioned that the network they use is Verizon. I cannot get Verizon service at my house. We live in a Verizon and AT&T dead zone. Also this phone does not have a removable SIM card so everything I have on this phone will be lost when I get rid of it. (And I will get rid of it.) Some of the information is important. I had a very difficult time getting this phone set up to use. It took several phone calls with the Great Call people and I don't think it should have been such a problem. I should have known that the good price I paid had some kind of strings attached. Think twice before getting involved with the Jitterbug phones. Make sure you can get Verizon service.,23,1

Samsung,"First of all, this phone isn't for everybody. But, that being said it definitely was the perfect phone for me. I was looking for quite a while for a phone that, on the inside, was nothing more than a phone (send & receive calls, send & receive text messages, and store numbers) and on the outside was durable enough to stand up to some healthy abuse. I haven't dropped it in a river or run over it with my truck, but I do shop work everyday and have dropped it, banged it against machinery, and my wife threw it at the dogs once, and it's still ticking just fine.I have read some reviews about it not being able to send media messages or access the internet if you're in the US. To me, that's fine. I haven't even tried to because I didn't care about that to begin with. So, if you're looking for a phone with some brains in it, you might want to look somewhere else. If you just want a phone that can take a good beating, this one is right for you. Above all, my best points of impression are:1) Screw Secured Battery Cover (regular snap-on ones are the first things to break otherwise)2) One-piece keypad cover (good for water resistance and reducing dust contamination)3) One-piece body (sliders and flip-phones will always break eventually, I don't care what they might say)4) A LED flashlight that could blind a grizzly bear (you never know when you'll need it)5) Small size (the only other one-piece phone I found similar to this was the even-more rugged $600 military spec. phone, and that sucker was around eight inches. This phone does fit into the fifth pocket of most blue jeans, by the way.)Other high points that I didn't expect, but have come to enjoy:1) FM Radio with the headphones acting as the antenna2) Music player3) SD micro card ready4) Loud speaker (for music and speaker phone)",72,4
Samsung,"I have had this phone for a little over a month now, and it has been terrific. I live on the coast, so a phone that is waterproof is particularly helpful. Bluetooth works great for transfer of photos to my computer and contacts between phones. The FM radio is nice too, although I have not used it too much, since it requires the headphones to be plugged in for reception. The multimedia player read the audio and video stored on my Micro SD card, and is intuitive enough to be able to play music by artist/album/genre/etc.I noticed a lot of concerns about getting multimedia messages (MMS) to work on this phone from other reviewers. I searched AT&T's help forums and found the following settings, which have worked for both my B2100 and the one I got for my girlfriend last fall.From the menu, navigate to Messages --> (5) Settings --> (1) Multimedia Messages --> (3) Multimedia message profiles.Hit the left soft key for ""Options"" --> (3) Create. Here are the settings for each of the fields:Set name: Media NetHome URL: [...]Bearer: GPRS firstProxy: OnAddress: 66.209.011.032Port: 80DNS1: 0.0.0.0DNS2: 0.0.0.0Then, immediately below DNS2 is ""GPRS Settings"" - click that and enter the following settings:Access name: wap.cingularUser ID: [...]Password: CINGULAR1The password is case sensitive, so make sure it is in all caps. Once it is all entered, hit the left soft key for ""Options"" --> (1) Save. Then, at the previous 'Multimedia message profiles' page, hit the left soft key again for ""Save"" - and you should be all set.",34,5
Samsung,"Always reliable. Never expensive. I've used Samsung phones in central Africa, the middle east, and the United States. I've TRIED to use Motorola, HTC, and other ""high-end"" phones and been disappointed every time. They look good but fail to deliver a usable phone connection every time. What a shame. I've never been disappointed by a Samsung phone or it's performance. This phone is rugged, sweat and tropical rain proof, gets a connection if one is available to be gotten. Easy to find accessories anywhere, from Kisangani and Nairobi to Dubai to Texas. These phones produce consistent reliable performance and at a reasonable price. If you need rugged and reliable get this phone.",13,5
Samsung,"Got this phone almost 2 months ago and have been waiting to see if I like it before rating. My complaints are the print & numbers are very small, there is no space or dash in the phone numbers so the 10 numbers run together, the number button are small, and the phone is bulky. Lately people say I sound muffled, I'm not sure whats up with that and phone can no longer be returned. The so called warranty is pretty lame also, hopefully this won't turn into an $80 paper weight.Updated July 2 2011A few more months have passed now and I no longer use the samsung B2100, after repeated complaints from persons on the other end of the line that my voice was muffled, far away or just could not hear me. One person even said I needed to trow the phone away. In addition the power charger started tripping the GFI outlet where its plugged in when the phone was charging.The goods news if there is any is that I was starting to like the phone despite the tiny number font it does have some nice features like call block.Read the Amazon phone warranty closely, you have to pay shipping both ways and repairs can take 3 weeks or more so you better have a spare. I am a big fan of Amazon but like I said earlier the Warranty is lame.Second update July13 2011I decided to contact amazon by phone regardy the warranty on the B2100 to see if i could possibly get it repaired and see what it would cost for the shipping. To my pleasant surprise Amazon's rep came back on the phone after having me on hold for a couple minutes to tell me they would give me a full refund and emailed a ups shipping label.Needless to say Amazon is the best to me.",14,1
Samsung,"First off - I bought this phone as a ""temporary"" replacement for an AT&T phone. I did some initial research, took the plunge and bought it. I went into this knowing that it is an unlocked T-Mobile phone being run on the AT&T network. As forewarned some features may not be supported. I have three issues that I can live with for the short term until I can get a decent contract phone (like the Motorola Atrix) without paying full retail.1st issue: Sending/Receiving embedded pics via text messaging does not work2nd issue: Does not recognize the AT&T 3G service (if someone out there does have it showing the AT&T 3G - please let me know).3rd issue: Processor is underpowered.More research and drudging through the Android forums - I found that someone else acknowledged the lack of supporting the AT&T 3G service. If you can update to Android 1.6 (I have not yet and won't till I have my contract replacement phone and will risk doing the update then), that seems to improve performance - at least in some of the reviews I have read. Unless you are running this over a T-Mobile network - you will not be able to do an over-the-air update. The 1.6 update is available at: [...] There seems to be two updates you have to apply. Once I do this (probably in a few months - I will update here).I do like the phone. It is nicely sized, has a good feature-set. The camera and video quality is pretty decent with a good set of controls. The call quality is excellent as is playing music out of it. I do use it as an alarm clock - though be forwarned. For some reason - the alarm clock version that comes with the phone does not allow you to add music from your mp3 collection to wake up to. But the Timer app does. Go figure.BATTERY ISSUE1 other issue that I am NOT down rating the phone for. I bought this phone back at the beginning of June. Battery life was as advertised - but this week has rapidly declined in performance daily. Today as example - started off the day with a fully charged phone - only sent/received 3 text messages. I am assuming this is a product that sat on the shelf for a long period of time. It is under warranty with the seller (BluetekUSA). I have sent this issue to them and am hoping to resolve this shortly.Hope this helps. Good phone. If you are buying to run on the T-Mobile network - by all means go for it. If you are a novice user and don't want to mess with updates - see if your reseller in this marketplace will do the 1.6 update for you. Doesn't hurt to ask!Robert",14,4
Samsung,"Well, I am not a huge fan of the touch screen smartphones etc.. I had recently purchased a Samsung Gravity 3 like two months ago, and after dropping the thing my screen was messed up, it had squiggly lines all over the screen and the screen would freeze on me and rather then going through t-mobile customer support I decided to just shop around and I fell in love with the look and colour of this phone.I was really suprised at how fast i recieved this phone! Before the G3 I had, I had a nokia nuron which was a NIGHTMARE DUMBPHONE! All I wanted was a simple phone. Well, I am IN LOVE with this phone so far.. The look, the colour, the screen, it's not heavy nor bulky!The camera actually has a flash..and it's a 5.0mp camera..T-mobile has offered different data plans, and I got the 10 dollar plan for 200MB of data which is fine for me because i dont use data very much but I went on the web on the phone and its actually pretty decent.. It beats the nuron by a long shot.. Texting is very easy.. You can text using qwerty. Phone calls are clear as day.. You can also use it as a MP3 player.. This phone came with a USB cord to upload music, haven't tried doing that yet! But all in all, I am really liking it and I rate the phone a 10!*~*Update*~*Had this phone for awhile now, the camera SUCKS!!!!!!! The flash is bright.. It doesn't take clear and clean photo's. It kind of distorts the colour a bit... I tried going into my camera settings and switching some things around.. It helped a little bit, I have taken flash off it helped some what, but it still distorts the colour of the image and it takes forever for the pic to be taken.. Also you have to go into settings on camera everytime you wanna take a pic to change them, no option to save changes, that kinda sucks... But I am not gonna down grade my rating because of the camera, it's not something I use all the time... Other then that, I STILL LOVE the phone :-)Oh and I have used the MP3 player on the phone... I LOVE it.. you can use the music you upload on your phone as ringtones... Its awesome..Also, for those with the myfaves plan, this is a myfaves phone just incase anyone was wondering.",23,5
Samsung,I recieved my phone rather fast was very excited about that but once i turned the phone on and started playing with it it would power off than would turn back on so i contacted the seller and he offered to send me a new battery I have emailed the seller a number of times sence than and have heard nothing from them the phone now will not turn on what so ever i am very upset with the product and more so with the seller I would not recommend this product nor the seller to anyone.,49,1
Samsung,"I was weary of buying a cell phone online rather than in the Tmobile store, but I was very pleased. The phone is in excellent working condition, and I have no problems with it. It arrived quickly.",18,5
Samsung,sleek and stylish phone very easy to use. only problem is when receiving pics it warns of roaming charges if i continue. im not getting charged but its a bit annoying.great camera and easy to use if you prefer an uncomplicated devices as i do.all in all good phone for the price.,16,4
Samsung,"This phone was listed as used. I read the description of it and it said it may have a few scratches. When I received the phone, it was like brand new. The Convoy u640 is a great phone to start with. It's not a fancy phone to text with - although, you can certainly do that. The camera is nice and takes real good pictures. Most of all, it is rugged and you can make and receive calls on it where most phones don't have signal. So, if you tend to be a little rough on cell phones, you may want to check this one out esp. if u find a deal like I did for $40- Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged! Also worthy to mention, they are very easy on batteries. I know several people who have them and they say the same things - so, it's not just mine that gives u plenty of talk time per battery charge.",44,5
Samsung,"I read lots of reviews for this phone. I was confident when I made my selection to order this Samsung Convoy. Now, Im one satisfied customer. I love how big the buttons are. The durability is great!!!! The clarity is crisp and the volume is super loud. (Great for alarm )!!!!! Best phone I have ever bought!!!! I recommend this phone.",44,5
Samsung,Really like the phone and ease of use. The screen is large enough for me to read the numbers and the keys are large enough for my big fingers.,12,5
Samsung,"I purchased this phone for my husband, as I needed something that could withstand his many drops and slips. I am impressed so far. He hasn't destroyed the phone yet. The speakerphone is actually loud enough to hear people on the other end outside, the screen is nice and clear and the menu is easy to understand. Overall the phone seems pretty sturdy and has a nice solid feel to it. I think this phone might stick around for a little while. If you are looking for a rough and tough phone, then do not hesitate... you've found it.",16,5

Samsung,"I am 65 years old and I have always had a flip phone. My grandchildren 11 & 13 all have those smart phones. The other day I had some trouble with my flip phone and there are very few new ones you can buy so I went to my carrier and what prices on these phones with contracts to boot. I was going through Amazon and I see this phone. There is a video on line for this phone so I watched it. If you can read a picture you can do this phone. When I received it I put the sim card in and set it up myself. I practiced a little with it and now I am getting really good. I even hooked up my blue tooth for the road and figured out the speaker. I am so impressed with myself. The instruction book even has pictures (Yea)! I think the visual is pretty good because I don't have to put on my glasses. However I have fat fingers and the alpha part is tiny, but I don't really text. A stylus would help. I would recommend it to anyone who is afraid of the smart phones. All the accessories can be purchased online for under $5.00 each. I feel this was a really good value and I didn't have to commit to a new contract.",18,5
Samsung,I just got this phone.I look at a lot of phones and decided on this one.I so love it. I dont have a data package bc I didntwant to spend the extra money but the good thing aboutthis phone is it has WIFI and I can get on the internet without a data plan.. Yay...I love the keyboard also bc I Texted all the time.I am so happy with my purchase.,13,5

Samsung,Great phone!!! Awesome touch screen it includes an sd slot which is great for when I download all the music I haveThere are no cons to this phone;works perfectly!I suggest if ur giving this to a teen buy a case and screen protectors. The phone is heavier but it's not really a problem it has a stylish look more for a girl than a guyIt has 2 touch screens which is great and this phone is perfect for those ppl who don't have enough patience when it comes to virtual keyboards and if u like the virtual keyboard this has one 2. It is froyo which is a bit behind but there isn't much of a difference in speed and how the phone works. All in all great for anyone starting smart phones. I love it!!!!!!!!,16,5
Samsung,"I bought this and it looks and works great. But the one I received did not come with the Samsung adaptive fast charger to connect to this to power it up. Thankfully I have extras from other phones. But just wanted to add this to anyone possibly buying this. There is another white one here on Amazon that says it does come with it here.?ÿSamsung Fast Charge Wireless Charging Stand, White?ÿBut if you already have the one that came with your Galaxy phone this will work perfect. Or you can buy the wall adapter separately. It charges much faster than any other wireless charger I have tried with my S7 which is great. If you have any questions feel free to ask, Ill try to answer, or get the info.",13,4
Samsung,"I'm older & already had this phone but got it wet so instead of buying a different phone to get used to, I found the exact replacement. No getting used to something different. I'm happy with it. It is a little more sensitive than my original but other than that I'm happy.",11,4
Samsung,"I have owned this model phone for 3 years, and recently mine has begun functioning more slowly and losing battery charge quickly (<24 hrs with very little use). I first replaced the battery and when that did not fix the problem decided it was time for a new phone (I have dropped this phone MANY times, so I'm not surprised it's time for a new one). I actually tried a different model first, which made me realize how much I like this model! It's easy to navigate and one of the best features (IMO) is the slide-out keyboard. It's not too small to use, which is one issue I've had w/ other basic phones. If your needs for a phone are just talking and texting, this phone should work well for you. It does have other features, such a music player, that I use infrequently but that seem to work well.",15,4
Samsung,"I purchased this phone a few days ago to replace my LG Thrive. I researched the phone to double check it is compatible with AT&T's GoPhone Prepaid program and sure enough it is (AT&T sell this phone in their GoPhone section only at $499). The phone was delivered the day after in good condition and it was sold by BLUTEKUSA. The phone looks new and has no noticeable fingerprints or marks that would indicate it's been used, although the box it came in was obviously opened before. It came with the phone, charger, and a pair of headphones.The Samsung Focus is pretty easy to set up. It asks for date and time as well as a Windows Live ID which can be synced with later if so desired. The screen is beautiful, Super AMOLED making the display rich in brightness and color. There are physical buttons for the Power button, Camera, and Volume Control. It's plastic, so the phone is pretty light, although to the point where one might consider it cheap. The back is a thing plastic case that snaps onto the phone. Taking off the back is a bit on the scary side as I felt I might have snapped it the few times I tried. Overall the phone is a nice build just not one that screams high quality.The Camera takes really good pictures and I was impressed with the 720p video recording as well. Again, not high-end, but it's above average nonetheless.I updated the Samsung Focus to Windows Mango and the software is fantastic. The interface is easy on the eyes and is smooth. I have not seen any hiccups on this phone even though it only comes with 512mb ram, although that seems to be a restriction from Microsoft. To me, it has just as much polish as iOS (the operating system that the iPhone/iPad run) although it lacks a lot of the customization of Android (not really missing it). It integrates Facebook and other social network clients into one area and so far I love it. The keyboard is easy to use as well and have not had any trouble misspelling words.*Edit* Fixed problem with the SIM Card. This phone is excellent. Windows Phones are under appreciated.",10,5
Samsung,"I have been using this phone for about two months by now. Before I bought the Samsung Focus I owned the HTC Surround, Apple's iPhone 3GS, and HTC Touch Pro. I will review not just the phone, because I think the OS is also very important when talking about a WP7 Phone.Dimensions and Characteristicsthe screen size is bigger than iPhone's 3G or 4G. Talking about image quality, I prefer the Focus, the image is brighter and color look awesome. This phone is really slim and light, the opposite of HTC Surround, which is much thicker and heavier because of the sliding speaker. The built in camera is good and you have a good flash light also which is nice to have when taking pictures in dark ambience, but of course, the image quality is much lower than using a digital camera.User InterfaceMicrosoft has done a great job redesigning the screens in WP7 (now WP7.5) with ""Metro"". You will see that the icons (which are called tiles) in the main screen are ""alive"" and are not static icons like the iPhone or Android or Blackberry. The tile gives you information about your contacts or a group of contacts (updates from Windows Live, Facebook, My Space, Messenger, Twitter and LinkedIn). Now many applications are using live tiles to give you specific information so don't have to launch the app to see some important information. Also live tiles make the main screen more attractive... I like them.Zune vs. iTunesAfter using iTunes for several years, I just realized that if you don't have an Apple's computer, then you will have some troubles using iTunes (at least that's my experience). I have to say that I like Zune much more than I like iTunes. Zune is all about multimedia, the user interface is really nice, full of watermarks which change depending of what you are viewing and that makes you enjoy using the software, the opposite feeling when I use iTunes which I consider boring and I use it because I have to in order to synchronize my iPod.TouchscreenI think Focus' touchscreen responds better than iPhone's 3GS or 4G. The screen responds incredible fast (compared to iPhone) and touch is very accurate (much better than I got in Touch Pro... I can't even compare them!)Marketplace vs. AppstoreIn Ecuador the items you can purchase from Appstore is very limited due copyright terms (but Apple opened many items last week for Ecuador). In US you will find a lot of more applications in Appstore than Marketplace, even though Microsoft is doing a great job with developers, but there is a long way to go. I would really like to have applications in Marketplace like Google Maps (even though you have gMaps) and Skype (which has been announced to be delivered be the end of 2011). If you think the applications are something really important when you have to pick your phone, then I recommend that you look at Zune or Marketplace if those applications you really like are available for WP7. If the application is not in available, then you can check at developer's forums if there are any plans to develop the software, but now you can find almost every great application in WP.KeyboardIf you are used to type using a built-in keyboard (like Blackberry 9300 or similar), then you will have some troubles while you get used to type on the screen. iPhone's and HTC's keyboard work pretty much the same, both respond fast and the size of the letters are good enough to type without making many mistakes. You can turn on the grammar checker that helps you to correct misspelled words (several languages now with Mango Update). Even though 99% of the time I write in Spanish, I have to say that the spell checker works great.Office HubI expected more from WP7 Office hub. The office applications are extremely basic and I still don't know how to synchronize documents from the phone to the PC (without using Skydrive), or transfer files from the PC to the Phone.ConclusionIn conclusion, I am not an expert about phones; but I have used several models and OS and I really like WP7 (which is completely different of Windows Mobile. WM was the worst OS I have used!).With Mango Update (also known as Windows Phone 7.5) you can create groups of your contacts and pin the group to the home screen. Since you can link information from Messenger, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter of your contacts, live tiles will tell you if anyone of your contacts in the group has shared something in any of those networks and you can make any comment or share anything you want without using any app, because everything is integrated in the OS, but not everything is perfect, now I have to charge the phone twice a day, actually now I have a charger at home, at office and the car (I hope there is a way to fix this because the battery lasts some time 5 or 6 hours, if you play a game then it will last 1 hour).In the Message Hub now you can send messages not only using the regular SMS, you can send messages to your contacts in Messenger and Facebook Chat. The phone will let you know if the contact you are writing to is connected to one of those two networks (or both), otherwise it will suggest sending a regular SMS.I am really happy with this phone and I don't find any reason to go back to iPhone or change to Android. I also think this phone is better than HTC Surround due to a better screen, is lighter and has a better camera.",11,5
Samsung,"Two I917 purchases -- first one defective, inaudible ear volume. I did some online checking but was unable to determine if cell-to-ear volume was a specific model weakness. Three points from my ordering experience: 1) check the vendor's return policy before purchasing; 2) when you receive the order check the phone properties first--it's easy to become enchanted with smartphones to the point of overlooking the basic on ear use; 3) buyers should reflect on the liklihood that any unlocked cell listed is actually new.To date I've found my second phone to be sleek, with the Windows 7 system impressive. Apps are increasingly available and diverse, not the walled garden of Iphone.Of contacting Samsung: dealing with customer support (Samsung or any other) be aware you likely will interact with a rep--working from a script--who has no cellular expertise. Check the manual carefully before entering the customer service ordeal.You'll be directed through two corrections, soft reset, and if the problem remains, hard reset. (You can find both on any model via web search). If these two corrections fail you're at the point of sending the phone in for repair or returning to seller.If you do need to contact Samsung, I found Facebook easier than web site contact. Twitter is also an option.Sept. 2016 update: I'm getting ready to upgrade from the i917. The phone has held up with no problems. It pretty much comes down to your ability to live with the Windows system and apps. I've noted some apps available in android and Apple are not available for Windows phones.",40,4
Samsung,"I am very satisfied with this phone. The only thing that could be better would be the availibility of phone settings. I think this is a limitation of the Windows Phone 7 O.S. On the one hand, since there are few settings, it is easy to set up. On the other hand, since there are few settings, you can not pick and choose when to use your data plan versus your WIFI during a specific action. It is on or off for WIFI, DATA, BLUETOOTH, AIRPLANE MODE. (My old Nokia had the ability to ask which network to use for every connection, which I liked.)While it defaults to WIFI when WIFI is present, it turns off WIFI in sleep mode to conserve battery life. I was kind of shocked to find that I used up 10 MB one night while I was asleep. A quick search finds this as a common complaint.I am on AT&T's Pay-As-You-Go plan, 10 cents per minute and I prepay for data, $5 for 10MB, $10 for 100MB, and $25 for 500MB. What I do is to pay $5.00 per month for the data plan, which rolls over my available data. This works out to about $100 every 6 months or so.There were no problems whatsover getting this phone up and running. It connects nicely with Microsoft's Skydrive. You can enter all of your contacts and calendar entries in Hotmail, and it syncs nicely with your phone, to give you a constant backup.Nothing bad to say, it looks great, there are plenty of apps available, and overall, it's a winner.Edit: There is one thing I'm not used to. There are no reminders for missed calls or text messages. So, I do have to keep looking whenever I am away from my phone.",34,5

Samsung,"I like the phone, it's great for the price, but I'm writing this review to warn other buyers, the phone i got IS NOT NEW.The phone is suposed to be new but it is not, and I'm not proud to say that this happened to me twice:I bought this as a present, and this is the second time, because the first phone I bought got stolen. This phone was sold on Amazon by UnlockedCellPhoneKings and seemed used. It came with a Screen protector on. But overall had no signs of being worn.But the second time I bought the phone was even worst, the phone was sold directly by Amazon and it came with an Scratched Screen Protector. So my first question is:If the phone is new why does it have a Screen Protector on?And the most important question:Why does the Screen Protector has several scratches ?I don't have a replacement for the screen proctector yet, so I haven't removed it yet.... My biggest concern is that the Screen may be also scratched.I live in Ecuador so for me is very difficult to send it back.I'm very dissapointed and I feel like I have been scammed.",15,1
Samsung,"First of all, let me begin by saying I was an early adopter of the iPhone, the first generation was a tank until dust got the best of it (under home button). Later on moving onto Android based phones and enjoying those as well. When there was a lot of positive feedback on windows 7.5 mobile and my other phone being drowned in beef stock. I decided to take the plunge with this little gem.Upon receiving the phone the packaging was no frills, and made me nervous. Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19.99 (PNY MicroSD) because in the documentation WP7 takes over the SD card for good!The operating system takes up about 1.2 GB so keep that in mind.I love the fact that I can delete the ATT default applications since I am on TMobile pre-paid (50$ unlimited). Yes it is only limited to 2G (edge) speed.Updating the phones software was the only difficulty I had. While updating I got a backup error causing it to not update. I believe it was the front USB port I was using on my computer but at the same time I used a different Micro USB cable from my mytouch and plugged it in a usb port in the back of my computer. Once I did that I was able to apply the 2 updates through the Zune software (required)Anyway, setting up the phone was easy enough. Adding my google account synced up my contacts/calendar/email (important since I came from using android)Another important mention for tmobile users is that you have to go to the marketplace and install the Samsung Network Profile app and select tmobile usa. After that you can send and receive MMSThe picture on this screen is beautiful, the camera has a lot of customization features, the UI is simple and clean I couldn't be happier with this phone at this price point.",16,4
Samsung,"Here's a quick review of the international Samsung Galaxy Alpha.Before I start, I'd like to mention I have the AT&T version of the Samsung Galaxy S 5, and I also have the AT&T version of the Galaxy Alpha. I compared all three of them.Build Quality:The Galaxy Alpha in general is a beautiful phone. I love the size and how thin it is. The metal frame looks great, but it also feels very solid in my hand. My Galaxy S5 seems to creak every time I hold it. The Alpha's build quality it superb compared to the S5.It's not water resistant, however, I don't mind. I prefer the slim design and I am willing to give up water proofing to have it. Also, it's nice not to have to deal with the USB cover and the annoying water resistant warnings Samsung overlays every time you reboot the phone or unplug the USB cable.Display:My honest opinion is the Galaxy S5 has a superior display. That being said, the 720p display of the Alpha is top notch. The colors are accurate, (in photo mode), viewing angles are great, brightness is adequate, and you get the familiar benefits of it being OLED. I would like to mention that you can see the negative side effects of the diamond pentile matrix if you look at text very close up. From a normal viewing distance, the display looks fine. I've read a couple reviews that said the display had a bluish tint to it. Comparing it side by side to my Galaxy S5 the whites looked spot on! I would like to note, the alpha has slightly more color shifting when you view it from off angles. In fact, the display DOES appear more bluish at an off angle than the S5 does. However normal viewing angles it looks great. Update: I took a closer look at my two Alphas side by side. The international Alpha does indeed have a slightly cooler shade of white than the AT&T model. I'm not sure if they were purposely calibrated differently, or it's just a manufacturing thing. The AT&T model has a more accurate white, although I think both models look great!Performance:The international Galaxy Alpha and AT&T Galaxy Alpha do have some differences when it comes to performance. I noticed this immediately when comparing the AT&T Alpha to the S5. The AT&T model was just as quick in general launching apps and performing basic tasks, however it seems like the AT&T Alpha has trouble handling scrolling as well as the S5 or the international Alpha (G850F) I first noticed it when I applied the phase beam live wallpaper. Scrolling on the AT&T Alpha become jittery and frames started being dropped. On the S5 and International Alpha, it was buttery smooth. I also noticed this issue in other menus, Facebook, and scrolling webpages. The S5 and international Alpha just performed better. This is strange, because the AT&T Alpha and S5 have the same Snapdragon 801 CPU. My guess is either its somehow being down clocked to achieve similar battery life results at the international Alpha, or the AT&T Alpha's software isn't optimized for the best performance. It's could also be the result of all the AT&T bloatware and junk they've added to US version. Either way, the international (G850F) is the way to go, and it performs just at fast as the Galaxy S5.Camera:Love the camera! If you loved the S5 camera, then you will love the Alpha's camera. Essentially its the same great camera minus a few megapixels. It still takes excellent quality photos, and the focus is lighting fast! The front camera is on par with the S5 also.Battery life:The AT&T and international Alpha appear to have similar battery life. Once the batteries get broken in and have a few charges on them, I haven't had a problem getting through the day with them. Honestly, the S5 will outlast the Alpha in terms of endurance, but the Alpha will most likely get you through a full day before it needs to be charged. Update: after using the ALPHA for a while now, my average battery life seems to be very good. I'm a mid to heavy user, but I can take my ALPHA off the charger at 7am and at about midnight it will be at 10-15% battery remaining. Not Bad!Conclusion:The Galaxy Alpha it a great phone! It does sacrifice a few things that make the Galaxy S5 so great, but nothing I'm not willing to live without. It feels great in the hand, works great with one hand, and it is the best looking phone Samsung has ever made. The performance matches what you would expect from the S5, and the battery life is respectable. I'm pretty happy with the Alpha. I do recommend buying the international version as opposed to the AT&T version as the AT&T version seems to have some general performance issues. (Just a note: The G850F has dark Touchwiz menus that play nicely with the OLED screen. The AT&T version has ugly blinding white menus. Also, the G850 allows dynamic manual adjustment of the auto brightness settings if its set. You can make it slightly dimmer or brighter without taking out of auto mode. Also! The G850F is free of carrier bloat and unlocked. ++)",58,5
Samsung,"Now what is there to say about the galaxy S5 that has not been said in the specs already.I bought this phone for my wife's birthday. when it got here she was so happy.Its a original unlocked S5 so we took it to the provider and as soon as it got booted up we saw that it was in Chinese language, my wife got scared and said that it wasn't original.So let me explain this model is for Europe so the 2 languages that are preset are Chinese for some reason and English so we switch that quickly to English and started the activation process.Everything works fine if you have LTE in your area it works and if not it just switches to what ever network is available at your provider. its a blazing fast phone compared to the exynos version.we are located in the Caribbean for those of you that live near these parts and it works fine with our providers. no issues so far with the phone itself. Why i give it four stars and not five is the fact that nothing is perfect, don't get me wrong its a great phone it has all the bells and whistles but its too big for me.",12,4
Samsung,"If you are looking for a mid sized phone you can use with one hand in June of 2016 this phone is your best option.Pros:- Phone fits perfectly in one hand- Battery life last all day and in some cases two days- Phone works great on AT&T network and will probably work just as good on T-Mobile- UI is smooth and doesn't lag- Phone material has a very premium feel- Price is very affordableCons- Only 1.5 GB of ram which isn't really noticeable unless you are heavily multitasking- Camera struggles to focus and stay focused at times but otherwise takes great photos- Runs android Lollipop right now even though Marshmallow is out (I hear they are releasing an update soon)- No active display or LED notificationIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices, but all in all I think this is a great phone (especially for the current price of $264).*Also its worth noting that I tried out a Sony z5 compact for a few days before purchasing this phone, and while that phone has better specs on paper it lagged and overheated easily, all while costing more money.",27,4
Samsung,"Phone looks great and feels great in the hand but if you are thinking of using this phone outside the America's and dont have a US activation sim, dont waste your time and money. The sellers dont make it clear that this phone is locked for use on other continents unless you first use it the US. This important detail is not in the product description but is tucked away in the Q&A section. If you dont have a US sim card, look somewhere else for a cool looking smart phone.",29,2
Samsung,I must say this phone is awesome. For years I was using two phones and refused to buy a dual Sim phone that did not meet my expectations. Then this beautiful guy was born and stole my heart and just had to have it that I bought 2. One for the hubby. Thanks Samsung I am loving it ....if fact I am using it now to send this review. Lol. Also thanks to JP Mobiles LLC for having this phone on amazon prime and a quick delivery.,19,5
Samsung,"Just a quick review,i traded this off a galaxy a7 for this phone,definately worth it,faster,more features and a thumbprint scanner,all in all a very solid cheaper alternative to a galaxy note 5,just a side note..actually i just wanted to make a pun,i have no side notes..",13,5
Samsung,"Just setting up this phone on cricket wireless network,had to add data settings manually first try got edge,went back in the settings and check 4g automatically and it's blazing, the screen Is awesome ,am coming from a S5 and am not missing it, love it.",12,5

Love it ! & LOVE IT !????????????????????ƒ?ƒ?ƒ??????????????????????????????????????????????It has finger scanner in the front ,really novel.Big & really nice cellphone.The only drawback is that it's a bit slippery material‹¬?but i still love it!Texture feels good, nobleFast shipping,good seller.",12,5
Samsung,You want a phone? You have it.You want a tablet? You also have itAmazing phablet by Samsung which comes with 13 megapixels rear camera and 8 megapixels selfie camera. One of the best buys I've done for myself so far. This phone is truly amazing !,13,5
Samsung,"Do not buy this phone it's a big fake and they took my 434 dollars but thank god for amazon. Knox is unable to work on it.- Calculator app is NOT standard Samsung, it was labeled 'calculator' with no capital letter and the permissions it asks for is outrageous- There is no standard Samsung keyboard; instead, it was a 3rd party app called Typany keyboard- It had 'mobomarket' installed. I cannot install it.- It has 'cool gallery' which also had outrageous permissions...I cannot remove it- It has 9Apps installed - I cannot remove it- It has Horse Browser and after running AVG antivirus it came back with a positive on this app. I cannot remove it.- It has a File Manager which is also non-Samsung standard and also came back with a positive hit from AVG",17,1
Samsung,"Things started off rocky but ended up smooth. I bought 2 phones after reviewing the question and answer section very closely to see if they would be compatible with T- Mobile in the U.S. The phones are pretty but they DO NOT get 4g LTE on T-Mobile. They work fine for calls but Apps and the internet were difficult to get going. We quickly noticed that we couldn't send or receive group and picture text messages. We couldn't use You Tube, I- Heart radio or Pandora music apps unless we are in certain areas. We went to our US carrier more than ten times in two days to change settings and fix the issues and even contacted the seller to return them. While waiting on the sellers response, we found the right settings and we haven't had problems since. These phones get H+ speeds, not LTE but otherwise do everything as advertised. The screens are clear and bright and they have flagship build quality. Battery life is excellent and you will probably get two days of use before recharging. The seller granted us the return, but now we want to keep them. I have to give the seller High marks for customer service. The shipment was fast as well as their response to us. The moral of all this is that if you are going to get a international phone that a US carrier doesn't have, get ready for some frustrating times until they get it to work properly on their network. There will be a learning curve for them and you. Once they do, the phone just might be worth the wait.",17,4
Samsung,"This is a decent phone. I got the white one.Some high lights:Pros:- Screen size is 3.8"". It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp. Phone has a compact size.- Run smoothly on decent specs with dual core 800 MHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory. (a bit below the 1GHz on some high end phones with this same processor so this phone is probably underclocked for better battery life).- The phone has 768MB of RAM. (a bit below the 1GB on some high end phones).- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!! This gives the ability to skype or video-gtalk. Also gives the ability to add a face unlock app which is really nice.- Mobile Hotstop for tethering; WiFi Direct.- 1500 mAh battery with very good life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.- microSDHC up to 32 GBCons:- Gingerbread 2.3.6 (Would have liked to see ICS 4.0x on the newer phones coming out this year, I have seen only one reference to possible Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0x upgrade)- Maybe the price is a tad high @ $290 and a lower price of $250 would be more competitive.- Camera could be snappier. Hopefully an update would take care of this.Network: Update 12/04/2012- 2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900- 3G Network:GT I8160 - 900/2100 MHz BandsGT I8160L - 850/1900 MHz BandsNote:Amazon list the phone as GT-I8160 but there are actually two models of this phone which have different 3g bands. I ordered the GT I8160 from Open Group Wireless. Check with the vendor for the model number before you order.Overall:This is a nice phone with internal specs just below some of the high end phones.",102,4
Samsung,"I spent over an hour trying to decide on what kind of phone to get and it had to be at a good price. I wanted a phone with a flash and a foward facing camera. I came across a few but this one stuck out. I also needed a unlocked phone because I have pre-paid. I was very nervous because I've never owned a unlocked phone before and wasn't sure what to expect. I literally read every review for this phone *the English reviews because I speak only minor Spanish*. I weighed the negative to the postive and decided to order it. It came a day early and I tracked it so I would know when it was in my city. I waited 3 hours outside for the mail man, THAT is how much I wanted to go ahead and try this phone! I opened the box expecting something used or not right *the negative reviews scared me alittle lol*. But..everything was BRAND NEW!!!! It came with the phone *of course*, Charger, a European charger, and even earbuds for the phone. This phone is light but it runs VERY good! I did have to download a app to allow me to use MMS on my phone because it is a unlocked phone and I have AT&T. It's a free app and now I can send pictures and receive them now. The camera on the phone is very vivid. The flash is BRIGHT lol but thats what I wanted! The foward facing camera words very good as well. Both camera's seem to take High Resolution pictures. The phone came and looked exactly like the picture. You do get to set the language if you need to ""it was on European English when it first turned on, English, United States is right under it"". I synced my Google Account to it and everything else was tooken care of. The call quality is great and so is the speaker quality. This phone is so amazing! My brother has a iPhone 4 and was impressed with this phone because it's a definite upgrade for me and it was only $206. I'm in love with this phone!!!!!",66,5
Samsung,"First, the phone is an ""international version""...Italian to be specific. Seller, Wireless Everything"" failed to disclose this ""little fact"" and Amazon still allowed them to sell it. All...I repeat ALL...repairs and parts must be ordered out of New Zealand. (Samsung verified this fact as well.) That's going to be fun. My first impression of the phone has not changed...it's a nice unit and my wife loves it. It's the misrepresentation by this seller that has me so upset. BEWARE of ""Wireless Everything""!! Amazon, you too should be ashamed of yourself for allowing this!!",55,3
Samsung,"It works perfectly in Venezuela with Movilnet (2G/ 3G - 850/ 1900)It's light, HD, beautiful, and very fast. I love it.",43,5
Samsung,"I bought this to replace an aging Blackberry Bold. I really liked the Blackberry but needed a new phone with a bigger screen. I compared the iPhone 4S, 5 and the Galaxy Ace 2, and Galaxy SII. The iPhones just didn't do it for me. After you weed through all the hype, its a smartphone that is more trendy than useful. At over $600 for 4S and $800 for the 32GB iPhone 5, it was too costly for the features included. The SII was too large to fit comfortably in my hand and felt like a small tablet. The Ace 2 had all the features I needed at a reasonable price. I've had the phone for 2 weeks and have no complaints. Would definitely recommend over iPhone.",37,4
Samsung,"This is a very nice phone. It is just as represented. I purchased it for my wife. It arrived in less than a week with standard shipping. The phone was packaged in its original factory retail packaging (nice, elegant, white box), and sealed with all the usual original factory seals still intact with no evidence of ever being opened before. This was evident when you opened the box an saw how nicely everything was packaged. This is why I like buying items that are fulfilled by Amazon.Performance: The phone is very fast and the screen is extremely responsive, besides being very bright and sharp, with great colors. Screen changes and menu navigation is very fast. You can really tell the difference with its dual core processor performance. The WiFi set up in my home was intuitive, it went quickly and very smoothly. It did the hand shake with my wireless modem/router right away and asked me for the key. The WiFi speed is much, much faster than the Galaxy GT-S5360 that I currently own for myself. It was also nice to have the Micro SD card slot accessible from the side of the phone instead of having to open the back cover. The only reason you'll have to open the back cover is to insert the SIM card and/or to get to the battery. Also, this phone's performance in synchronizing with Samsung KIES is way faster than my GT-S5360.The camera photo quality is very satisfactory for a cell phone. Even interior pictures with natural light were good. Just make sure you give a brief moment of time for the auto focus to do it's job. The front VGA video camera seemed to by fine also.Don't worry about some comments from people indicating that it came with a foreign language. It doesn't matter. The minute you start the phone, the very first screen that pops up contains the language selection box, with a drop-down menu. It displays the current language. To change it, simply click on it and scroll down the drop-down menu and select the language that you wish to use. The language selections are written in their native spelling, so it's super easy to spot the desired language by anyone. In my case, I scrolled down to ""English"" and that was it. Immediately thereafter all the set up screens popped up in English. They also provided a small 2-prong US adapter for the European charger. It's handy to have the European charger if you ever travel to Europe, as we sometimes do. The charger itself is universal, so it will work worldwide with the right adapter.Don't forget to order your SD card and protective case cover at the same time so as to save on freight. Also, you'll need the SD card to get started with syncing and other activities, so it's good to have it at the same time.Cons: So far we haven't experienced anything that we didn't like, but we'll update if we do.",12,5
Samsung,"I bought this phone about six weeks ago, the first 4 weeks it worked smoothly, I was very happy with my purchase and I thought I had found a great replacement for my old Iphone, but then, about two weeks ago, I felt asleep and I didn't charge my phone like I usually do. The next morning when I woke up the battery was dead, it wouldn't charge anymore and Im sure it was the battery because I have a friend with the same phone and I tried her battery in my phone and the phone worked. I left it connected to the power for about eight hours straight and nothing. I had to put the battery in a plastic bag and in the freezer for 10 minutes (an old trick I learned from my dad) and it worked. I haven't had any problems with the battery in these two weeks, but I'm scared it might happen again, I have to be very careful not to let the phone run out of power and carry the charger with me at all times.Then, about a week ago I started to have problems with the camera too. It says it has some sort of error. I have to shut down the phone, take the battery off and turn it on again in order for the camera to work (my friend, the one that has the same phone has the very same problem) This can happen once or twice a day and it gets REALLY ANNOYING!.I've read that the update to jellybean is coming soon. I really hope this is true and that these problems will be fixed with the new software. I live across seas and I can't afford to send it back or to exchange it.------------------------------------------------ESPA??OL----------------------------------------------------------------------Compr?? este tel??fono hace 6 semanas aproximadamente, las primeras 4 semanas funcion?? de maravilla, pero hace como 2 semanas me qued?? dormida y no lo puse a cargar como normalmente hago.

Samsung,It was great to have it just put the SIM card that was it .Need two more,10,5
Samsung,"Wanted cell like the Galaxy 2 that this replaced. This is just a bit smaller in size not larger than the G2. GREAT for me. This has two mini sims cards. I will use with AT&T service. But you can choose who your service is with except two as stated. Information sheet included to start phone. ie: charge your phone, put batt here and where to put the sims card(s). This uses TWO mini sized cards (never seen one). My old sims card will not fit. Could not find information on line at first as the Samsung site would not take the codes on the box. (SM-G318ML) I called the help number on the site. It took a while but I did get to down load the information sheet for this phone. The main thing was when I went to Samsung galaxy site is had a US at the end. This cell is made for the UK. ie: England. Here is the information sheet if you want to view first. And your welcome.http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201505/20150511132052841/SM-G318H_UM_EU_Kitkat_Eng_Rev.1.0_150511.pdfNow I could just print or just save in my computer when I have a problem or questions. But Samsung did say they will mail me a hard copy (about two weeks).Now about the sims card. I went to my AT&T dealer. Great Idea they were great (Cleveland, Georgia). They have a machine that cuts the large card smaller (could have done that my self but did not know. Trim a littler on each side). They added another card free made sure all was up and working etc. etc. I was out the door with NO CHARGE. Great ""smart phone"". It does everything my old S2 did ALMOST. Plus a much better battery. I went with black color. Only thing I found was you can't do a selfie with this phone. Photos are good but not as good as the S2. I does have a flash. That's not a problem for my. Sometime I use phone for photos. Most of time I use a camera. My purchase was less then $100.00. Received in TWO days at no extra charge. Very happy. I can still use belt cases that I have purchase for other phone. An really do love the smaller size. Slips in shirt pocket. I can even see the screen easy. Bright screen, loud. Comes with Ear buds and 110 charger. Down loaded my apps that I used before. So far great. I just had to do a little work to get everything together. Now you will give 5 stars. As I did the work for you. enjoy,",41,4
Samsung,"This is my favorite cell phone, ever! Easy to use. Dummy friendly. I use a bare bones phone plan - no frills and this phone works well even with my cheap-o plan. I am very pleased.",13,5
Samsung,I thought it had a front camera did not realize until the person in a different country told me it did not have one. the phone is good other wise.,13,4
Samsung,"Very nice phone. It's not too large, like some newest smartphones, these days. It fits perfectly in a palm of a large hand.It's relatively light weight, considering the size. I've got used to my bulky phone, I've had before, and at first this one felt too light.After a day or two I got comfortable with it. The screen is bright and crisp and I love all newer features, a definite upgrade from an Android Jellybean firmware. This one is a KitKat Android and it works flawlessly.So far I haven't noticed any battery issues, described by other buyers.I took me seconds to transfer my contacts from a Mothership Google backup. :)There is no SD card slot in this phone but it's not really a problem. The whopping 32Gb of internal memory will do just fine.A SIM card is what they call ""nano size"". It means you will have to either cut your older, larger Simcard to fit here, or go to your phone provider and pay them a few bucks for a new one.The 4G LTE speed is very good. I use T-Mobile as a provider. Not a hiccup, so far.It has all kinds of bells and whistles, including NFC chip, fingerprint recognition and a lot more.It's slim and very stylish. I bought a white one and it was a good choice. The sliver/metallic bezel, around the case, gives it very sophisticated look.I use a leather case/pouch to carry it around. Since this phone is very slim it can easily slip out of the pouch.I recommend getting a silicone ""skin"" for it. A couple of $$ spent on ebay may prevent a crash.PROS:- lots of features- KitKat firmware, very stable- slim design - very stylish- large, bright screen in a case that doesn't look like a small tablet- good price/value. You get a lot of proverbial bang for your buck. I'm really not ready to spend $700 on a phone. This one was in $280 area and I was able to sell the old phone for $100, so the end result was a $180 price tag. That's acceptable.- very nice camera. I was able to generate a ""bokeh"" effect with it, to get professional looking portraitsCONS:- needs anti-slip ""skin""- buttons on the side are very sensitive - not a serious problem, easily solved by a silicone ""skin""- no headphones were included with it- no SD card slot, but again - a massive 32Gb memory will do just fine, until next upgrade.- there is an AT&T logo, on the back case, and when the phone starts up, the AT&T jingle plays. No worries. If you want to use it with a different provider, ie. T-Mobile - IT WILL work. IT IS an unlocked phone but AT&T managed to get their logos there. Not a big deal. Just ignore the initial jingle.Update: I have just discovered an important detail. A camera lens had a plastic foil/liner attached.It was barely visible, but it was there.Once I removed it (with my fingernail) the pictures got to be incredibly sharp and crisp.Make sure you remove that foil, from a lens, when you get your phone.",42,5
Samsung,"This phone is the perfect size for actually using it daily. Tasks were zippy, the design is flawless, the camera is a nice bonus which takes much better pictures than I expected. Could not recommend this highly enough.Note: I am using it on t-mobile. AT&T is the worst for bloatware, just go into setting/application manager/ find each AT&T app, clear the cache, clear the data, turn off notifications, then turn the app off.",11,5
Samsung,"After Reading So Many Reviews From The Good To The Bad Ones & Researching About This Device I Took The Chance & Bought It. & I Must Say I Made A Good Decision. I Was Afraid To Buy A Phone From Amazon Since I Never Purchased One On Here Before. The Only Bad Thing Is I Wish That I Knew What Type Of Sim Card It Held Because I Cant Use It Until I Purchase One. ???????? Camera Is Good. Emojis Bright & Colorful. Easy To Use. Nice Size Phone. Came In Box With Charger, Headphones. I Ordered This On The 3rd & Got It On The 6th In EXCELLENT CONDITION ??????. Everything Works Great ???. No Complaints.",17,5
Samsung,Amazingly fast and cost efficient device. I upgraded my 3 yrs old HTC w. windows OS after it started becoming obsolete.I definitely recommend it to everyone. It is ATT unlocked device and you might have to tweak the settings to get it going with you provider.I set up across the board functions for T-Mobile with no problems. Packaging looks cheesy and there is no headphones in a box but otherwiseit's a great buy!!!,19,5
Samsung,"Received as scheduled. This phone is a fantastic value placed between the S5 mini and S5 at 1/2 the price. ATT phone that I immediately placed on my StraightTalk plan. I did have to get a nano sim card since my Galaxy Express has a micro sim card. I used Samsung's Smart Switch app and transferred all phone info (contacts pictures messages, etc) with no problem at all. 4GLTE was clocking in at 20MBS using Speedtest app. Fastest performance I have ever had. Moto G maybe a better value at < $200 but I could not get one. This phone is way better looking though. Light in weight and a perfect sizeBest kept secret ever.",15,5
Samsung,"I bought it as ""Unlocked"" Phone. After received I surprise to see it support only USA SIM. On the box this issue is printed in big font. It says ""American SIM Card Only"". Seeing the message I did not open the box.I love the phone but I need to use International SIM card when travel.Just printed the Return Label and going to return today.",16,2
Samsung,This phone looks very good...does almost every thing the galaxy 5 does. love the feel of it but there is a lot of feedback when making a call. It also has a tap to unlock feature that makes it very difficult to pay a bill while trying to enter your debit card or other information. The phone locks when in call which I did not like so I send it back! For those of you that know how to do all the settings on a phone this could be a perfect phone.,10,4
Samsung,"Problem #1This is my first smartphone and I should start by saying that I did a ton of research on Samsung phones before deciding on this one. I got it because I wanted two active lines on one phone instead of having to buy two separate phones and it had the best price. This is supposed to be a dual active phone. However, when I got the phone I discovered that if you are using 3G sim cards in both sim slots then sim 2 will only work as a 2G card. It says this under HELP in the sim card manager. So I asked my carrier (At&t) about this and they told me that they don't even offer 2G speed anymore so I can't even use the second sim card. Of course I didn't know this until I bought the bloody phone so I'm pretty annoyed.Problem #2There is a double-tap to unlock function whenever you try to make a call and it comes up literally every 3 seconds and stays on while you are talking. It's highly annoying and At &t couldn't disable it and told me was most likely connected to the second sim card slot - the one that I can't use. So, I took the phone to the little Samsung booth at Bestbuy and even they couldn't tell me what purpose this served or disable it. However, I discovered that if you use the speaker phone or headset while making a call it goes away. It doesn't seem to happen when receiving calls. They ran an update in the hopes it would go away but it didn't work. Except now I can use the crappy little headset that came with the phone when I couldn't before.Had I known about these two issues I never would have bought the phone. Samsung needs to give more detailed imformation about their phones! So now I have to buy an additional phone.My one other complaint is that the sound quality doesn't seem that great, about the same as my previous flip phone. For the price I was expecting a little more... Also, the user manual is VERY basic so I'm still trying to figure out how to use the phone.What I liked: The camera is good. Battery lasts about 3-4 days with minimal usage, and the touchscreen is very responsive. I haven't figured out how to use much else. I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks so I'm considering returning it and getting a less expensive phone as I only need it for basic use. Though I've also noticed the same double-tap problem in some of the reviews for the slightly cheaper Samsung phones on Amazon.Aside from those two issues it seems like a decent phone, although over-priced for me. So if you don't need dual sim or if your carrier still offers 2G, and you use a headset for calls or you just need it for internet use, then this phone could work for you.",18,2
Samsung,"I ordered this off amazon, tax free, with two day shipping. Arrived in a timely manner, but just got to activate it this morning. Activation is very simple. The kit includes a sim card, which you just insert above (and to the left) of the battery in the back. Then you will want to go to t-mobile.com/activation and follow the instructions. It comes with a random $3.34 balance.. for emergency.. instant calling or something I suppose. But following the activation, it takes you to where you can pay for your service online. You can also get those cards at the store, but honestly, it's so easy just to pay online. And then you're good to go. I chose the $30 unlim text/data + 100 min plan. You don't need to go to walmart or tmobile to get this. To my understanding, it is only available for new activations.The price and quality of the phone is all great. One problem I have with it is that... honestly... I'm not really an Android fan. I didn't think I would mind it at all but somehow it really annoys me how much bloatware it comes with. Sure, there are ways to delete it. But people on reviews made it sound 100x easier than what I had to do. I don't really consider myself technologically challenged, but it was hard to find all the steps to uninstall this crap I didn't want. You can't just go to the ""APPLICATIONS"" menu and drag what you don't want to the trash. Why? Everything I've tried to delete just stays there when I go back to the menu. What the hell is that function for then? Why can I not just delete the stuff I don't want? (And there are many.)I'm new to Android so rooting was a brand new concept for me. I must have downloaded 4 different apps off the Android market to no avail. I didn't understand why the hell something called ""______ Uninstaller"" cannot uninstall apps. After a bit of research and trying a bunch of different things, I finally figured it out.I figure I'd type it out in layman's terms for those who have trouble rooting:- Turn on USB debugger (settings>applications>development>usb debugging)- Have the right USB drivers installed ON YOUR COMPUTER (Apparently these are difficult to find. Install the samsung galaxy x drivers from softpedia instead. When I did this, it told me it wasn't installed correctly but I couldn't find a fix so I just ignored it.)- Connect your phone to the computer via usb port- Then you can download SuperOneClick on your COMPUTER. It is a computer application. Extract (it is a zip file) and run. Click on ""root."" (top left big button) It may take a couple minutes. It should say root complete or whatever at the end. And to confirm that it is indeed rooted, you will see a ""Superuser"" icon in the applications folder.- Now you can begin the uninstallation, but that is not all! You have to download some more stuff to uninstall. From the Android market, you can find some apps that will allow you to uninstall items. Android Mate was too advanced for me. You have to know exactly what files you are deleting (which is a constant annoyance.) If you delete the wrong files then your phone might not work or it will brick. Kind of terrifying, considering the price I paid. I used Titanium backup to uninstall items, but you still run the risk of deleting things you need. It is better to ""freeze"" the apps but that is a premium feature, which you must pay for. I also tried Root Uninstaller to no avail. It didn't show any apps besides Market and itself for some reason. I'm sure there's something out there that might be better but, so far, my experience is that these apps are not that user-friendly.Others have claimed that the process above is ""easy"" but it wasn't for me, apparently. Maybe some people know how to do this intuitively, I don't know. But think about it. All I wanted to do was delete pre-installed junk like internet radios and ""MORE FREE APPS!@!!"" apps. But it took entirely way too long. You can just press on any app in iOS until it's shaking and then press X to delete. A couple seconds, max. I don't understand why it is so hard to delete things on the Android (not even including the risk of bricking your phone at every corner.)Aside from my long rant, in the end, it is a good deal for a 4g smartphone and great rates on plans. Still, I'm not too satisfied with Android. I feel like it's one of those apple vs. windows commercials, comparing efficiency. There's a pre-installed anti-virus (free trial for 14 days, then you have to pay). Really? I never even thought that would be an issue with iOS. Obviously these are my opinions, and others will have no problems with the bloatware. I'm a bit OCD and inefficiency is such an annoyance. I just want my phone to run as efficiently and quickly as possible, not having junk on it that tries to make me install more apps or pay for premium services. Yes, the iphone costs way more, but I would still rather have it than Android. That's just me though.EDIT:After a few days of use, I'm getting used to the Android system more. I don't mind it as much, and hopefully it will hold up well. It's still a fantastic deal, and with no contracts none-the-less! In the end, the savings are fantastic. Think about the activation fees and taxes and whatnot when you have to get a phone with a contract. This phone is really a smart purchase.",207,3
Samsung,"I love this phone! There's so many reasons why this is such a great phone, here's a few off the top of my head...1. Low price for an unlocked full featured phone (have to wait 60 days to unlock free)2. Large User base and developer/hacker base. Plenty of Samsung Exhibit II user forums to get most of your newbie questions answered3. Lots of inexpensive accessories/batteries/cases. I paid $13 for a bundle that included 2 batteries/charger/gel case/screen protector4. Lots of useful info by other owners/users if you read the reviews here5. Great multimedia Android phone. I just finished watching the latest Transformers movie on the phone with Netflix!6. Excellent T-Mobile 4G network7. Excellent, inexpensive prepaid plans. I pay only $30 per month using the Walmart 100 min/unlimited data/text plan8. Turn your phone into a wireless hotspot for only $15/month and run your laptop and up to 5 wifi devices using your phone as a wifi hotspot.9. Use your Gmail and Google Calendar and Google Maps10. Great GPS functions and mapping11. Facebook, Meetup.com, Metro.net etc. most of the websites that I frequent have apps available12. microSDHC slot to add up to 32gb of memory13. Camera, voice/audio recorder14. Free wifi calling using Google Voice and GrooveIP. Takes a little messing around but once you get it, you'll love it and not use up your 100 minutes. Buy the$5.00 full version of GrooveIP and don't bother with the free/crippled version.14. Plenty of hacks to root this phone and get rid of bloatwareI bought this phone from Amazon and use the Walmart/Tmobile $30 prepaid plan giving me unlimited data/texting and 100 minutes of voice calls. But with the FREE WiFi calling (see #14) I use less than 50 minutes a month as I'm always around a wifi network. If I manage to exceed the 100 minutes, I pay 10 cents a minute... big deal... Later this month, I'm gonna try using the phone as a wifi hotspot ($15/mo) and if it works well at home, I'll dump my cable service that I pay $136/month for cable internet and tv!Just re-upped with Netflix for $8/month for unlimited instant videos as they've added a lot of movies to their catalog and don't bother with the mail in DVD's anymore... Although I did just buy a Blu-Ray player... The Netflix movies play great... well, I was using my cable/wifi connection to watch a movie. I haven't tried watching a video on just the 4G connection yet.Oh, I live at the bottom of a canyon in the Hollywood Hills and most of the other service providers I would not get any reception but with T-Mobile I get a solid 3-4 bars!Cons:1. Battery life is not too long if you are a heavy web user. But buy a couple of spare batteries ($7ea) and no problemo...2. Phone is small and slippery standard, so get the gel case and that will fix the problem and protect the phone3. Seems I can't view my Amazon Prime free videos on the phone. But maybe it's possible and I just haven't figured it out yet...Yeah, I'm a huge fan... this is a great deal for the phone and low monthly cost for a prepaid/no contract unlocked phone.UPDATE 9-2013: I suppose I've downloaded too many apps. My web browsing and operation of the phone has slowed considerably. I am now planning to root my phone and remove all apps that are bloatware and not needed. Thus at this time, I'm down grading this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. This is a single core processor, so my next phone will most likely be a quad core or no less than a dual core processor. If after I root the phone and it enhances the performance back to acceptable levels, I'd bump the rating back up. zxcvb",10,3
Samsung,"I got this phone about three weeks ago to replace my LG Optimus T. I liked the Optimus T, but felt it was a little laggy when running apps and the screen was smaller than I really wanted. This phone initially seemed perfect: bigger screen, bigger memory, better camera. All of that is true and I really enjoy all of those aspects of the phone.My biggest complaint is the text messaging. The phone, out of box, has some pretty bad texting problems that can be found across the t-mobile board (wish I had seen those earlier!). Messages fail constantly; some messages that fail have more than 160 characters, other are short messages. It took me five minutes to get an ""Ok!"" sent to one of my employees. If this problem didn't exist, this phone would be a 4-star for me, but both Samsung and T-Mobile support don't seem to want to do anything about this problem.",45,3
Samsung,"Let me start this off by saying I'm not someone whom normally writes reviews on Amazon as when I buy stuff, it's generally things that people aren't on the fence about. However, I decided to go ahead and write a review to strongly recommend that you consider the Samsung Exhibit II from T-Mobile. When I read the PR from T-mobile about this phone, I got really excited that finally a GOOD smartphone was coming to the prepaid lineup at a reasonable price. I placed my order the day the phone came out and received my order on November 4.Screen Quality --- I think the specs are not quite as good as some of the top of the line models, but they're incredibly sharp and pretty dang close. It's incredibly clear and leaps and bounds better from the earlier android and iphone screens. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Text is smooth and crisp.Phone calls --- Sound quality is excellent and sounds like a landline using T-Mobiles free wi-fi calling app. It integrates seamlessly with the phone and elects to use Wi-fi if a good signal is available. If not, it'll switch to the cellular network. There are no apps to install on the device or on your computer/router. Like I said, very seamless. Also, phone calls over the cellular network sound excellent as well.Text Messages --- Typical Gingerbread text message interface. The phone comes with swype which I had never used before, but have since become accustomed to and am thrilled it came preloaded on the phone.Memory --- The memory is a bit shallow. The specs say it has 4 GBs of memory though I have about 1 GB of USB storage and 1 GB of onboard memory. I don't know where the rest is though it could be used by the Android OS. Honestly, I would consider it a non-issue since you can get a Name brand Class 4 32GB microSDHC relatively inexpensively. I certainly have the option to upgrade the memory at anytime. Also, I have installed every app I can think of that friends have/use as well as several Amazon free apps of the day and I've used under 1/3 of the 1 gb system memory available. With the Amazon Cloud music player, it makes the total storage on your droid phone a non-issue since Amazon lets you upload unlimited music to their cloud for free. Then, you can stream it to your phone for free. So, I could have 200 GBs of music on my Amazon Cloud and this phone could play it all perfectly without the need for tons of onboard memory. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there are several free radio Apps that I found on Amazon that are free and stream thousands of stations.Battery --- I've been getting about 15 hours of usage out of the phone and keep in mind, this is my first smartphone so it's still fun to play with. I don't have the screen brightness maxed out, but it's definitely bright and good enough. Also, the nice thing about buying a non-Apple device is that it has a user-replaceable battery. I found a generic replacement from Amazon relatively inexpensively. So, after a year of charging and uncharging when the battery begins to age, I can buy a new one and it'll be good as new.Overall, this is a great phone for the price. It's honestly not as snappy as a top of the line, dual core smartphone, but you're also not paying the price of that new phone either. It's still fast enough to handle every application I've run on it. But, I do have several widgets and services running so I know that I'm taking up ram and CPU power doing that.",45,5
Samsung,"Well the phone was acting funny the since yesterday. It froze on me a few times, never did that before, I had it since Jan 7. Then today I removed the battery the battery to unfreeze it, and when i put it back in, it would not turn on. Nothing. Totally black. I googled the info to do a hand reset using the keys, and that would not work either. Big waste of money. Never buying a prepaid phone ever again. Neither am I buying anything from T-Mobile or Samsung. Don't know why my phone failed, so I'm not buying any electronics from those brands again, so it wont' happen again.",11,1
Samsung,ive had this phone for over 2 months now so ive had plenty of time to see how bad it really is.dont believe all these 4 and 5 star ratings so misleading.the phone is overpriced for what it does.for one thing there is much false advertising in the description.the phone doesnt have 512 mb of ram it has 356 and what they dont tell u is that 88% of this is devoted to running tmobil's pre installed crap apps.u cant uninstall those they are bloatware and there is tons of that. this in fact causes the android os to crash at times and reset alot from lack of ram.so customizing your home screen and such is risky.so 200$ is to much to pay for an unstable phone that tmobil pays samsung to ruin with crapware.next the cam is 3mp no big deal but the description says dvd quality video recording also a fals statement.u can record at 640x480 and dvd is 720x480 it does make a difference on a tv screen or pc monitor.and recording is risky as well it may reset again bah.then reseting during a phonecall bah again.so all in all its not worth it if u want a smart phone u can find better that actually works and for around the same price so keep searching.,11,1
Samsung,"After coming across T-Mobile / Walmart's $30 monthly plan, I started looking out for a phone that can connect on T-Mobile's 4G network. The two other candidates (Galaxy S II and the not-yet-available Galaxy Nexus) are all above $500, and I'm not sure I want to spend so much on a phone. Then I came across this one.It lacks some of the other features I'm interested in. I'd like to have a good camera, this one is about average. I'd like to play with NFC. And dual processors would be nice in some situations. And I'd like to have Gorilla Glass on the front. But I'm not prepared to pay full retail for a Galaxy S II. Contracts don't make sense in my situation when I take the total cost of ownership into account - I don't use the phone enough to justify the price.For the price, though, this is an amazingly good phone. The display is crisp, the UI is responsive. Voice is clear, and it gets better reception than my other phone (a clamshell feature phone). It's easy to root, which you'd need to do if you want to uninstall some of the bloatware T-Mobile put in there. It won't win any design awards, but it looks good. It has a 3.5mm headset jack, LED flash, takes microSD memory. The micro USB port is protected behind a sliding door.Activation was painless and can be done online. The SIM card and all other information is included, and if you don't have the box handy and don't want to remove the battery, you can get the IMEI by dialing ""*#06#"" - it'a also easier to read this way. There's $3.34 on the card, so you will need to add money if you want to activate the $30 Walmart plan. Getting T-Mobile to SIM unlock the phone, on the other hand, is painful. When I talked to a rep, she told me my account needs to be active for 60 days. I have another T-Mobile prepaid account that qualifies, but then she said that SIM needs to be in the phone for more than a day, and to call back later. This is despite me explaining I paid full retail for the phone.I've not tested the data network too much yet. I'm sure you can find reviews of T-Mobile's 4G network elsewhere. What little I've tried was quite fast and responsive, but then again, I had 4 bars of 4G signal at that time.Battery life was OK. I did not measure it before I uninstalled the bloatware, so I'm not able to state how much of a difference it made. My email client constantly checking for mail probably is not doing battery life wonders either. And I have it connected to wifi both at work and at home all the time.Added after 5 day road trip : you definitely want to pack a charger with you (or a micro USB cable). Even with limited use and battery saving options turned on, it would be practically depleted after 24 hours.Additional update on battery life : I rooted the phone and deleted, among other things, T-Mobile's My Account and changed my Hotmail app to sync only on demand (instead of Push). Battery life appears to have doubled because of that.The only thing that really irks me about this phone is the inability to connect it to my computer. I had to install Microsoft's MTP Porting Kit on Vista before it would connect, and I couldn't get it to connect to my Windows 7 laptop. Both run 64 bit Windows. Some web forum posts mentioned installing Samsung Kies for the drivers, I'm waiting to see if there's an alternative before doing it. You can use Kies Air to connect to the phone. Kies Air runs a HTTP server on the phone and allows you to connect from another computer's web browser (no software install required) over wi-fi to manage the phone, including file transfers.I had a hard time finding USB Mass Storage Class mode until J. Weng helped me out in the comments. Apparently, it is under ""Wireless and Network"" and is not a permanent setting, but needs to be activated every time you wish to connect.There are a number of errors in the manual. I think one part stated it had 16GB of internal storage. That is incorrect, there's only 4GB of internal storage. The organization of some other parts is confusing, and the section about storage is just one huge mess.It would also be nice to have the micro SD accessible without having to open the battery cover, but it is a small inconvenience.Finally, it would be nice if there are more accessories for this phone. It's still fairly new, but some choices of skin / case would be nice. I did find a very nice case though :?ÿT-MOBILE SAMSUNG T679 EXHIBIT II 4G SMOKE BLACK TPU GEL SKIN CASE, IN QUBITS RETAIL PACKAGINGOverall, I'm very happy with the purchase. I'd rate it 4.5 stars if that option is available.",39,4
Samsung,"Pros:Cheaper than iPhone.Call quality - not spectacular, but it usually works.Pretty good camera.No contract. Unlimited voice, text, and data with a prepaid T-Mobile plan.Cons:Sluggish keyboard response, especially in Facebook and text messaging. Often have to tap a button or text window several times before it responds.Unacceptably slow internet unless you are in an area with a strong 4G signal. Even when connected to wi-fi it will often wait 30 seconds then give a ""Lost connection"" message while my iPod Touch right next to it quickly loads the same page.Comes preloaded with more than twenty applications that you don't want, will never use, and can't uninstall. As long as you own this phone it is going to keep nagging you to update these applications that you didn't want in the first place.Summary:I regret buying this phone. For me, the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. I will wait until the iPhone 5 comes out, bite the bullet and spend the extra money, then get rid of this thing on eBay for whatever I can get.Update 6/4/2012: I have now had this phone for almost two months and there are continuous problems:1. The phone reboots at random.2. The screen often locks up, forcing the user to reboot.3. Very slow internet and facebook with the screen stuck on the ""Loading"" icon for minutes (or forever). This occurs even when there is a good wi-fi connection.4. And the worst - failed text messages. Google ""tmobile text failed"" to see all the problems that people are having with this phone. When trying to send a text message, it comes back with a ""Failed"" error message. Sometimes it may work after several retries. Other times it never sends. Or worse, sometimes it does send, but gives you the ""failed"" message anyway. So you keep trying to send and the other person receives multiple copies.Changing from two stars to one star. I wish I could return this thing. I'm afraid it's too late now, but I am unlikely to ever buy another T-Mobile, Android, or Samsung phone after this bad experience.",35,1
Samsung,"I normally don't write reviews, but this phone is so horrible I must. I was led astray by the various glowing reviews I had seen here, and needed to replace my horrible Motorola Defy, and this seemed like the perfect fit. Unfortunately, this new phone is almost worst than the Defy was. It freezes ALL THE TIME, and like some of the other reviews have pointed out, is horribly unresponsive. I thought mine was defective, but after reading some of the recent reviews, realize that all the screens must be bad. The texting IS horrible, and lags so much. Not only that, but the back button sometimes doesn't take you to the main messaging screen, it takes you to another chat window with another person! Push back again, and another person! I get so frustrated texting, and sometimes, to text once, it'll take a good minute or so JUST to get to the text box. Ridiculous. I also have to constantly take out my battery because the phone keeps freezing. Just now, it wouldn't even let me take a phone call! Phone kept ringing like it was possessed, but only a blank screen. Sometimes, I just feel like throwing it against the wall and smashing it to pieces, it frustrates me so much. This phone deserves ZERO stars. Be a smart consumer and STAY AWAY. I sure wish I had.",12,1
Samsung,"I was expecting this phone to be decent and usable. But I am blown away by it's hardware. The screen is amazing. Bright, sharp and crisp are words I would use to describe it. It is one of the nicer screens I have used on a phone or tablet.The phone also performs well. I haven't had any troubles running programs yet and in the few videos I have pulled up on the internet played without any problems. There has been a couple hesitations when trying to switch between windows but it definitely is not the norm. I am impressed with the interface that Samsung has put on the phone. I was thinking I would need to tinker/root the phone to maximize it's abilities, but I might just leave it as is. However, the phone is loaded with bloatware. Rooting might be worthwhile to get rid of all the excess programs.The phone comes with an activation kit...however, I popped in a post-paid SIM and it ran fine. 4G works as advertised.",12,5
Samsung,"I have had the phone for about a month now. I must say that going from a ""dumber"" phone to this has been a life changing experience and I will never go back to a non-smart phone. The phone itself is really quite nice, it is the perfect size (not to big, not to small) but like many have commented, very slippery! Getting a case for it is a must. As noted, it does come with some bloatware that is preinstalled and the only way to get rid of some of the applications (like media social, etc) is to root the phone (this gives you administrative rights - for the brave just google ""rooting samsung exhibit II"" and you will be able to find the means to do so).Since many reviewers have described the positive aspects of the phone, I wanted to point out that not all is rosy with T-mobile's pre-paid 100min, free text, free web plan. I was dismayed to find out that I was not able to use Google Voice as the default voicemail for the phone, nor was I able to use T-mobile's own preinstalled visual voicemail --- I can see the business logic behind these moves (T-mobile does not want pre-paid customers to have easy ways to get around using the limited 100 minutes while checking voicemail (google voice and visual voicemail use data instead of minutes)....still, I feel that T-mobile has mislead customers (they have nothing on their website that states that going pre-paid ""limits"" some of the features vs. what subscribing clients have access to).Still, it's not a bad deal overall - just annoying that they treat pre-paid customers like 2nd rate clients.",25,4
Samsung,I purchased this phone because of it's ability to tether my computer via Wifi Hotpot. I signed up for the $60 per month-to-month-unlimited plan with the first 2GB of 4G. Long story short you can't tether. I was even told by 2 customer service reps multiple times that it was included in my plan but they never managed to get it to working properly. Meaning every time I would turn on the hotspot I would navigate with my computer to google.com and it would redirect me to t-mobile.com.I am returning the phone under the 14 days buyer remorse and I canceled my account with T-Mobile (when I asked for a refund they hung up on me) apparently they don't give refunds for unused pay-as-you-go funds. I am writing this review so you don't loose $60 either...***** DONT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU WANT TO USE THE WIFI HOTSPOT IT DOESN'T WORK AND T-MOBILE WON'T REFUND YOUR MONEY ******,24,1
Samsung,"After less than 1 month of using this phone, we experienced texting issues - essentially texts wouldn't send & we'd get a failure message. A call to T Mobile customer service had us going through all kinds of hoops trying to diagnose the issue & finally the CS just told us to switch our SIM card. We did & the phone worked well for about 1 week. We are now back to texting issues & unable to receive/make phone call issues where we have to power down the phone, wait & power it up again.However, upon looking at the message boards on the T Mobile website, I learned that other people have this same issue & T Mobile has acknowledged the issue, but has not resolved it.<<This is a known issue with this device. Putting the phone on GSM only, as mike_s stated, is a workaround. We ask that you please be patient with us as we work with Samsung to come up with a resolution.>>The T Mobile workaround:I have found a few things that can help you text in the meantime. First, I'd look to uninstall any texting applications that were used during the failures, and if the texts aren't very long, it might help to not allow the phone to switch between 2G/3G networks. This can be done like this; 1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key. 2. Tap Settings. 3. Tap Wireless and Networks. 4. Tap Mobile Networks. 5. Tap Network mode. 6. Tap GSM Only. While it isn't ideal to keep your phone on GSM only (as browsing speeds will be slower and you will need to manually change the network back to get faster data speeds) we have found that short texts on GSM only rarely fail. I hope this temporary workaround finds you well, and know that we will continue to work on this.T-ForcePersonally, I think that patience can only last so long. Apparently, T Mobile has known about this issue since November but has done nothing to fix it nor have they offered a replacement phone to unsatisfied buyers.We really liked this phone, but it is simply unusable if it doesn't allow a user to text. From 5 stars to 1 star.3/8/12: Phone still has texting issues & T-Mobile has done nothing to rectify the issue. You can never tell if the phone's recipient actually received your text & we are still experiencing bouts of text sending failure. We are switching to the Lumia 710 & giving up on this phone. Disappointing. What a waste of money.ORIGINAL POST (LOVED THE PHONE):We are on a T-Mobile family plan & it was time to bring my spouse into the world of smartphones. Since he is hard on his phones, I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but wanted him to have access to email, maps & the other benefits that smartphones provide.The Samsung Exhibit II is an impressive little phone. It is easy to pick up & start using right off the bat. It has swype capability, voice texting & an easy to use/read calendar (voice capability to add an ""event""). There are a ton of nice features packed into this phone & it costs less than half of the ""fancier"" smartphones on the market.We purchased a soft silicone case to start?ÿBlack Soft Silicone Skin Case Cover for Samsung Exhibit 4G T759?ÿ& it fits fine; however, when a more durable case comes available, we will probably upgrade.",23,1
Samsung,"I am using it with T-mobile monthly4G $30 for 100 min and unlimited (5GB) data. My wife has Virgin mobile LG Optimus V with $35 or $25 (price increased last year, but previous subscribers still pay $25) / month no contract for 300 min and unlimited (2GB) 3G data.Pros.1) Hardware faster and better compared with LG Optimus V2) 4G is faster than 3GCons.1) It is T-mobile! Monthly4G $30 for 100 min and unlimited (5GB) data plan is offered at WalMart or online only, T-Mobile web-site is glitchy. I could not complete activation online, by phone T-Mobile will try to rip you off $50 a month. T-mobile promised to change the plan in 10 min, but I had to call them several times.2) It is T-mobile! Samsung Exhibit II 4g specs has FM radio hardware built-in, but FM radio is removed from t-mobile version by t-mobile request in order to suck your 4G data limit.3) It is T-mobile! It has preinstalled Carrier IQ, which is keystroke logging and location tracking software, which can intercept text messages. Even information that should be transferred only within encrypted sessions is captured in plain text by Carrier IQ. Worse Carrier IQ is integrated with task manager and cannot be easily uninstalled (I have not found uninstallation way yet).4) It is T-mobile! Besides Carrier IQ phone has a lot of preinstalled crapware. LG Optimus V from Virgin Mobile is practically clean compared with Samsung Exhibit II 4G.5) It is T-mobile! Phone has calling over IP using your wi-fi network, but T-mobile will rip off your monthly minutes or charge you 10 cents a minute over 100 minutes for using call over your wi-fi. To avoid it you need to use Skype or Google talk (GrooVe IP) over wi-fi or 4G. 5GB limit is sufficient, but you need to spend your time again to configure GrooVe IP.Bottom line.Phone is good, but avoid T-mobile and Samsung (Samsung preinstalled Carrier IQ on many phones), I suggest to chose Virgin Mobile and LG unless you really need 4G speed and do not care about your privacy. They have LG Optimus V really cheap. Alternatively you can invest your time and install custom firmware for this phone, but this is a new model, and there is not so much choice available yet (unlike Galaxy S or LG Optimus V). There is no cyanogenMod for this phone yet. Probably better to wait a half year before dealing with this phone unless you are going to contribute into custom mode developing yourself (see discussing below).Update:Installed Titanium backup (backup system), RebelROM (custom firmware), GrooVe IP (free calling using google voice works fine over wi-fi and 4g), juice defender (save your precious bodily fluids, battery power). Never automatic update phones with custom ROM, no factory restore... Everything clean and working, but too much work required. Cleaning other Android phones, including Samsung Galaxy S and LG Optimus, is much simpler and faster. One star for wasting my time, five star for the phone potential with future better custom ROM (waiting for cyanogen mode).",23,1
Samsung,"My previous phone was an iPhone 4 which I got for the ecosystem/iLife compatibility with my MacBook Pro. This phone looks and functions like a value version of the iPhone. Whereas the iPhone has a solidity and style that belongs in a design museum, the Exhibit II 4G feels more like a beautiful everyday object, one that, when dropped, inspires irritation rather than panic. The two phones are actually very close in terms of general hardware features, notably the mini-tablet shape, size of the screen, image quality, bi-directional camera, and other smaller details. (It is very easy to see why Apple had filed a lawsuit against Samsung for imitation.) The biggest adjustment personally has been switching from the buttery smooth responsiveness of the iPhone touchscreen to the entirely functional, but uninspiring, Exhibit screen. Otherwise, I am extremely pleased with the range of apps, built-in Swype and voice texting, crystal clear Wi-Fi calling (useful for an occasionally spotty T-Mobile network). Ultimately the decision is whether a great iPhone is worth $60 a month more in subscription fees than a (very) good Exhibit. AT&T and T-Mobile offering a comparable service, we past and present iPhone users are essentially paying an extra $720 a year to remain in the exclusive Apple ecosystem. What's an iLife worth to you?",22,4
Samsung,"I deleted my original review from 2012 because I see people are still buying this thing in 2015, wow folks. Really!? At the time I wrote ""best no contract phone out there"" and so on which in hindsight sounded better than reality. Number one there were few no contract options out there at the time. Secondly for the nearly two years I owned this piece of junk, it turned out to be one of the worst choices I could have made for a phone. It was slow, froze up all the time and crashed like cars on a highway in a snowstorm. No amount of custom ROMs could save it. Now I wouldn't even give this away knowing the grief it would cause someone else.Soon it will be 2016 and there are plenty of great deals on GOOD phones now unlike in 2012. So if you buy this and complain about later, you are only to blame, not the phone or the seller.",22,1
Samsung,"Initially I was turned off by the very poor battery life, even after turning off wifi, GPS and Bluetooth and putting the screen brightness to the lowest setting. I was also disappointed at the sluggishness of the phone, plus how it would freeze not infrequently. I was thinking of returning the phone at that time.However, after spending LOTS of time trying to figure out how to root the phone, and finally accomplishing this, the phone really does seem to work like a charm. After googling ""how to root Samsung Exhibit 2"" and reading the top several matches, I got frustrated that I could not seem to find the right Samsung driver or download Zerg Rush Root. But after scrolling to the next page of matches, I found an entry on ""Samsung Exhibit 2"" in Wikipedia. The directions under ""rooting"" worked like a charm for me. They had the Samsung device driver for download, as well as Zerg Rush. It took me a little while to figure out how to download Winzip (I used the free ""evaluation"" version), which I needed to ""extract"" the Zerg Rush zip file. But after I figured that out, turned my phone to USB debugging, and plugged it into my computer, the phone automatically went into root mode (I saw a DOS screen pop up, giving the status of the rooting), and about 5 minutes later, the phone was all rooted! I then downloaded ""Titanium Backup"" (you first have to tell your phone to allow apps from non-Android marketplace), went to ""backup/ restore"" and deleted the unwanted apps.The battery life has increased tremendously since rooting the phone, deleting the junk apps and also installing Juice Defender. I leave wifi on all the time, and 14 hours later, the battery still has 77% life left in it. Before this, the battery would be nearly empty by this point. I even bought extra charging cords to have in the office and in the car, but it looks like I won't be needing these too much now. I can now wait to charge the phone when I get home.Unfortunately, one day after I rooted the phone, I am not able to find the link above to paste into this review. I went to Wikipedia and did not find anything under ""Samsung Exhibit 2"", nor could I retrace my steps and google my way to it. Sorry about that. But good luck trying to root your phone. It was worth the effort and frustration on my end, although just barely.",13,4
Samsung,"Not because the phone itself is revolutionary. It's an average phone if you look at the specs. It's because the phone allows average people to afford a quality smart phone with an affordable plan. I switched from the OG Droid on Verizon to the Exhibit II on T-Mobile two months ago, and I couldn't be more pleased.Mobile phone companies in the U.S. have been fleecing the public with smart phone plans for years. The Samsung Exhibit II 4G, along with T-Mobile's $49.99 ""all you can eat"" plans (available in both contract and prepaid flavors depending on your preference), represents a milestone that should change the industry, if only more people knew about it.First of all, make no mistake: this is a solid mid-level Android phone at a bargain-basement price. Great screen, great touch screen response, good performance. It's rootable, so you can remove the bloatware (XDA Developers is a great resource -- Google ""XDA Developers Samsung Exhibit II 4G root"". Once you're rooted, download ""Root Uninstaller"" from the Market and follow XDA's advice about which apps to remove).Let me briefly tell you our story. My wife and I bought Motorola Droids a few years ago for $250 each (2 year contract price!), then paid Verizon $170/month for a family plan with 1400 minutes, data, and text messaging. When it came time to upgrade, we felt that was too much money, downgraded to feature phones (bought from eBay), and started paying $110/month for 1400 minutes, text messaging, and no data.Fast forward to a couple of months ago. Thanks to this product we were able to buy two very good Android phones on Amazon for under $200 each. Brand new, full price, no contract. We are now paying $100/month combined for unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data. Yes, Verizon's network is better in rural areas. But if you think about it, who needs to pay $1700 extra over the course of a 2 year contract so you have coverage that one day or one week per year you're in BFE? In reality, very few people.But that's not all. Even if you're in BFE, Wi-Fi is ubiquitous. Many campgrounds have it, all McDonalds in the U.S. have it, etc. This is good news because the Exhibit II comes with T-Mobile's fantastic ""Wi-Fi Calling"" feature. This means you can use your phone anywhere in the world with Wi-Fi without paying roaming charges. Or, within old metallic office buildings with Wi-Fi where no cell phones from any provider work. Even Verizon can't beat that. I'm telling you, it works wonderfully. IMO, Verizon's admittedly superior wireless network is not worth anything close to $70/month more than T-Mobile's for the vast majority of users, especially when you factor in Wi-Fi calling. Your priorities may vary.In short, this is the best value in cell phones today. You get a mid-level Android phone without a contract for under $200. You get a plan that lets you use its full potential for only $50/month, from a legitimate national provider. You get this for less than many smart phones cost with a 2-year contract.I applaud T-Mobile and Samsung for producing a high-quality offering that makes smart phones accessible and affordable to average people. I hope this becomes a trend with other carriers.",21,5
Samsung,"Based off of previous experiences with Samsung products I thought this was a great deal, boy was I wrong. The phone constantly shuts off and repeatedly freezes. I don't believe the phone has enough RAM to support many high end games/apps available in the Android or Amazon Market. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.",14,1
Samsung,"This phone had a 4 star rating at the time I purchased it and I relied heavily on that. I received this on a Friday and by Wednesday it was back in the box ready to be returned. First off, as soon as I held it in my hand I felt the lack of quality in the build. It feels very cheap and it weighs close to nothing. Immediately upon turning it on I noticed the lag on the screen. It was annoyingly slow to respond at times. I found myself having to tap the screen for any given command more than once very often. Texting was the most annoying issue on this phone. For whatever reason, the bottom most part of the screen was extremely unresponsive all the time and it just so happened to be where the window to add text was. Lastly, 4 days into owning this phone, the earpice stopped working completely. People could hear me speak but I couldn't hear anything when I held the phone to my ear. To be fair, there was one thing I liked about the phone. The screen is impressively crisp. Maybe I just got a bad unit but this phone was a complete disappointment.",17,1
Samsung,"I purchased this phone because I was trying to get a unlocked galaxy express the phone arrived on time, but this phone was not new the back label where the phone info is,under the battery part of that was cut and they tried to glue it back in place, they had done some repair on the phone got it from tablet distributors I sent the phone back for a refund what a waste of time, now just have to wait for refund.",10,1
Samsung,"I've pretty much have been a "" flip "" phone user during my cell phone life or a regular cell phone user since they first came out years ago. My previous flip phone which still works is the Motorola Tundra which I am considering going back to but not for reasons you might think. The major reason is that I am on a limited income and the cost of a flip phone vs. the smart phone is the difference of night and day. I pay about 45.00 dollars a month for my flip phone and the service price doubles to triples depending on your data plan with my "" Major "" service provider. So for 80.00 dollars or more per month I can keep my Smart phone running as long as I pay the bill. But with services like Straight Talk Net 10 or other compatible service provider out there the cost could be cheaper although you get what you pay for and sometimes that might not be a good thing. Now the better news. I have no complaints about the Samsung Express phone but keep in mind this is my first smartphone so I am very smartphone stupid. It is a nice phone and I do like it. It serves the purpose for me as I don't text that much or use the data as I am still trying to figure out just how to run this contraption. If you want or need more memory, then you can but one o them new fangled chips and put in the slot built for it. This phone is relatively easy to use if your knowledgeable with the smart phone world. The main reason I bought it is that it is an unlocked phone so if I finally get pissed off enough with my current carrier, I can take it to another GSM carrier of my choice that has the same system type that I am on and WHA LA, I have a cheaper bill with the same amount of service or more service for less price and bear in mind that this is an option that one has when they buy an unlocked phone.I have owned 3 different unlocked phone. The Motorola Razor, the Motorola Tundra, and now the Samsung Galaxy Express. I have never had a problem with the first 2 with the exception of the age of the phone vs. newer technology. I am very happy with both of the first 2 and both currently work well to this day. But technology changes so one must at least try to go with the flow of things.If you like the Smart phone, I would have no problem in recommending this phone. For a person like me who is not smart phone savvy, it might take a few times to get hold of the ropes of figuring this new fangled contraption out, but that's why we have you young'uns around to help use older generation old timer folks out. LOL But if your knowledgeable in the smartphone world, then I say go for the gusto and get one if you don't need all the bells and whistles.I also purchased an HHI Hybrid Dual Armored Case that has a flip out piece on the back of the case which helps the phone stand in an upright position and it comes with a stylus pen which attaches to the phone and I put a ""invisible Shield"" screen protector by ""Zagg"" on the front of the phone to help protect the screen.",11,5
Samsung,"One flawless phone with no complaints I found, is this one.(1) This phone has Android 4.0 OS with no glitches, smooth loading. It only takes 8 seconds to turn on (from the time you press the power button and to go to the main screen).(2) Comes with 8GB of built-in memory (available 5GB for users)(3) Camera produces excellent pictures (both front and back)(4) Battery gives good power back up(5) Neither too small, nor too big(6) Touchscreen behaves the way it is supposed to(7) 1.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8960 dual-core process is awesomeThe reasonable price for this kind of phone could be around $150 to $175 range. This phone is little pricier.No complaints and only compliments instead for this phone. Thanks.",15,5
Samsung,"This isn't necessarily an issue against the handset itself, just a heads-up if you're seeking an unlocked and/or international version of the phone.Product was tampered with prior to delivery. KNOX counter was tripped, and after breaking ""factory seal"" stickers, I noticed that an earlier sticker had been overlaid with a new one.Signal strength on AT&T is US on LTE bands extremely weak as compared to two other phones (iPhone 6 & HTC One M7) when sitting side-by-side. Could never get a decent signal even in heart of DC and southern MD.Purchased branded AT&T model (SM-G920A) and confirmed much stronger LTE reception.",383,3
Samsung,"I bought the phone in June 2015, from the start signal presented problems of its short battery life and the need to charge it for about 12 hours (???), but I used it in these conditions for a couple of weeks. 23 sepriembre phone lost all signal went dead, useless, I took the Samsung store Colombia and my mobile operator, and both agreed that the IMEI of the device had been reported in blacklist (which is considered a crime in my country), in addition they found that the phone was altered with two IMEI, one that is visible by typing * # 06 # is: 350,000,000,000,006 and other IMEI in the back that is: 359,937,062,902,630, which does not match, which is that is not original and is of dubious origin. (Annex photographs)To date it has been impossible to obtain an invoice or receipt by WORLD WIDE containing the real IMEI cell, let alone a satisfactory answer, just give a hotline where you never answer, but do not solve anything, do not give and serious enough, according to the problem, no explanations quality control and consumer protection, and their return policy is precarious, because only accept returns within one month of purchase. But what happens if after that month, I realize that the IMEI of the device is locked and that the cell is useless?The truth is that lost about 600 USD, I have been forced to buy another phone, and suffering a series of injuries and discomfort, lack of diligence of the company.I do not advise anyone to perform operations with this company, very segumente have problems and lose their money, the lesson learned is better to pay a little more but buy appliances in recognized shops that offer real guarantees.",126,1
Samsung,"I bought my cellphone 6 months ago, the Samsung s6 is an amazing phone. However, my phone stopped recognizing the Sim card for no reason. I called the worldwide distributor support (almost 1 hour in the line to spend 2 minutes talking) and they said that I have the Samsung warranty for 1 year. Ok, cool! However, I called Samsung US support and they said that I don't have warranty because my phone is not from USA, it's from Malaysia, so I should call the Samsung Malaysia support (What?). I called Samsung Malaysia support, they said that I don't have warranty because my phone is not in Malaysia (of course not, I bought in US). I called again the Samsung US support and explained everything and they said that I should call the seller because this is their problem. I'm trying to reach the worldwide distributors support since 12/28/2015. I spent at least 50 minutes waiting in the line each time that I called. They always answer the phone, listen to my problem and keep me in line with that background music and a lady saying ""we know that you're busy, someone will help you soon""... I don't think so. They didn't help me at all. I also think that my phone didn't come new. I reset my phone and the configurations are totally different than the first time that I turn on my phone 6 months ago.Again, Samsung is an excellent phone. If you buy the phone in a better seller I don't think that you will have the same problem. I'm a little upset because if I have bought an IPhone I'm pretty sure that my problem would have been solved already.",10,1
Samsung,"I can't say I'm unhappy with my phone; however, I am unable to get any Customer Support from Samsung, because this is an International Version and was originally in Latin when the Open Group Wireless received it. I feel their is some deception - then to find out they don't/won't warranty it is very disturbing! I WOULD NOT PURCHASE FROM THESE PEOPLE, YOU CAN'T EVEN CONTACT THEM! There are many things that don't work on this phone - call waiting doesn't work, no option for conference calls, I can't even register it with Samsung because it is an International phone - I can't get any customer support - PERIOD! I'm studk and I hate it!",10,1
Samsung,I ordered a brand new factory unlocked phone but I received an already setup and appears to be used phone with one app (LINE) installed on it. I do not recommend this to anyone. I returned the product.,50,1
Samsung,"First of all this is an reasonably good phone.The reason i gave it two stars is for many reasons one of which is because the battery life is terrible. I have uninstalled most of the pre-installed apps and disabled the bloatware i cannot uninstall. Additionally the screen brightness is low and all automatic updates are turned off. I charge my phone to 100% unplug it and go to sleep in the morning sometimes it is as low as 40% remaining. In addition to having to recharge it in the morning i have to charge it again at around 2-3pm to ensure it lasts till i get home at night.The second problem i have is that the OS takes up 1.2GB of ram the apps which i have on the phone with isnt many, it is mostly mail clients. Take up another 1GB leaving only 600mb of ram free, I can easily see this phone slowing down quickly in future android updates that would eventually utilize more of the available ram.If you have the S5 there is no need to upgrade to this phone.",11,2
Samsung,"The phone is great but there are two things that I was concerning about:1. I ordered G920F and the seller sent me G920FD which is actually the dual sim version and I don't know if that is the better option.2. When I turned on the phone, the battery was on 38% and for less than an hour of use the battery drained.",37,4
Samsung,"After reading many reviews, I began to get worried about the authenticity of the phone. Some said that it was fake, or that the battery life on the device was terrible, so I was prepared to return it if it were not real. I purchased this on June 29, 2016 and received it on July 1, 2016. When handed the box from the UPS deliverer, it was in great shape. I slid the Samsung Galaxy S6 box out of the one it was shipped in, and was glad to see that THE SEAL WAS NOT BROKEN, and was the correct color. I then opened the box and saw the phone with all of the original accessories included. Unfortunately it is the international version and there is no warranty provided. So I made some calls and found out that you can PURCHASE 2 YEARS of warranty off of Samsung.com. When you search for ""Protection Plus"" a screen will appear, providing you with the option of buying 2 YEARS OF WARRANTY for $99.00. The phone works fantastic and is lightning quick. Its battery life is great and It is totally worth the purchase. I decided to write this review to include things that I wish others would have included. Lastly, I use MetroPCS and it works great. Also, there are many unanswered comments on other post like ""Who was your seller"" or ""Who'd you buy from"". I'll gladly tell you that I purchased this device from lifeline786. He shipped quick and answered many questions that I asked through email, almost immediately. Some say that the model code on this phone is fake ""SM-G920F"" but it's not. This model code means that it is a global version of the phone. Hope this helps! :)",33,5
Samsung,"This phone has an amazing camera, crystal clear screen, and wicked fast response rate. This phone is perfect for someone who wants one of the new phones but doesn't want a phablet.Pro tip: To make your battery last all day and then some, put the phone on power saving mode and always close all apps before turning the screen off. Seems like common sense to me and I've always done this, but many people don't and wonder why their batter drains so quickly with all their open background apps. The app Juice Defender also works wonders-----Update: The screen was suddenly glitchy and now won't turn on. I've had this device for less than a day.

Samsung,"After trying my hand on everything from symbian to ios to windows phone to android, I was not going away from android any time soon.In terms of hardware also I have tried them all and the only problem with android phones was that they were kind of ugly.Then came this phone.They have been calling it the best android phone ever and I can even dare say its the best value you can get for a phone presently.I really don't have anything remotely down the negative side from my experience of 2 weeks.some say the battery wont last long,its as good as any other phone I had and its definitely not super but 12 hours average with normal usage is enough for me (and using the power saving mode can squeeze out a couple of extra hours).Another thing that some people may find a negative is non expandable memory, well again atleast for me 32 gigs is pretty cool and you always can dump stuff on your computer and the cloud (dropbox,google drive,onedrive so on..).Paying for storage (its the cheapest component in any device) in not something anyone should be doing (unless you are a corporation).I will be surprised if any phone in the near future will be able to beat this one in terms of value.",23,5

Samsung,I was extremely disappointed in my purchase of this phone from Amazon. The phone is dead. I purchase it on June 12 and it died on June 27. One week. One minute it was working the next minute the screen was black. I would like to know how i can recover my money or get a different phone. I am so very angry right now.,15,1
Samsung,The only problem is the information the phone has 8 GBytes of memory - we can only use 4 GBytes - the other 4 GBytes are reserved for system usage. It should be cleared in specs.Regards Jair Gabriel,21,4
Samsung,"I had an unlocked Galaxy S4 ($800). Everyone knows all the specs and features of that phone. It took one fall, and it was done.I got this Galaxy Grand Duos ($350) as a replacement. I didn't know what to expect, but so far, I'm pretty happy with it.GOOD:-I didn't use all of the S-features on the S4, but I'm happy MOST of them are on the Grand Duos (I can't seem to get all of them to work, but on the same note, I couldn't get them to work on the S4 either. I use 2 screen mode a lot, and I'm happy it's on the Grand Duos)-specs say that the screen resolution is not as good as the S4, but I honestly can't tell the difference-the interface is much like S4 and Note, so it's very easy to use and to get help with (ie screen shots, 2 screens, awake with voice are the same process/commands on all Galaxies).-call quality is clear and consistent.-it's bigger than the S4 and smaller than the Note (which is perfect for me!)-battery life is actually better than it was on the S4 for me (possibly bc of the lower screen resolution)-it looks great, and I'm in the ""Galaxy"" club, without any contract/subsidies, and for a fraction of the price of the Note and S4. While I can tell it from the S4 and Note very easily, other people can't (except a Samsung representative noticed every difference instantly)-it has things the Note and S4 don't have (dual sim for avid travelers, FM radio, minimal bloatware with just the essentials and a few Samsung apps)-it looks expensive enough that I'm proud to have it out, but it's secretly cheap enough that it's still replaceable if lost/stolen/broken on a tripBAD:-the camera is not as good. It takes decent shots, but with 8 MP (vs the 16MP on the S4), you notice that you are missing some detail, especially when you zoom. If the focal point is distant and detailed, it comes out a little muddled. Good quality up close and without zoom, Also, if it has all the nifty camera features like the Note and S4, I haven't found them yet. So far, it just seems to be run-of-the-mill camera options-if the Grand Duos has 4G, I can't seem to find it-I don't think it has scroll with eyes or look away pause, but you can scroll with tilt and turn over to pause (I haven't used them yet, but they're there in the settings menu. On a positive note, a lot of those extra features on the S4 and Note are battery drainers anyway)-fewer awesome accessories available (like docks, magnetic covers, etc)-it comes with a European plug (my seller tossed in an adapter, and I already had a few anyway. I'm definitely planning on ordering an American OEM Samsung charger)-the speaker is perfect for making calls; even on a mount in the car, there is no trouble communicating with the mic and speaker. However, when I play music, it's a little quieter that I remember the S4 being.-Less internal storage space than the S4, the Grand Duos has 4GB internal (I read there would be 8GB, but my phone says 3.94GB internal space). I have a ton of apps (all internal for now), and a few songs and pics (most of my media is on my SD and all of it is backed up to cloud).Other things to note:-I thought the earphones jack didn't work, but you really have to push it deep in there until you hear a click.-both SIM slots are for the standard (large) SIM cards. I used my same mini SIM card from my S4, but taped it in to a SIM adapter ($1 on Amazon, $5 at T-mobile store if you can't wait for shipping). I didn't have it taped, and my phone stopped working one night. The next day, I took it to T-mobile, and she just taped the top. I haven't had any issues since)Do I recommend this product? --All the time!Am I happy with this purchase --Absolutely!Will I get it again? --If I lose this one and the next generation isn't here, then of course I will get this same phone again. Ideally, I would like to keep this phone as my international phone for trips, and get the S5 for the US when it comes out (if the camera is better than the Nokia Lumia 1020)",20,4
Samsung,"When I decided to purchase this phone, the fact that the screen is five inches is just about right for me. A very generous screen, yet the phone is lightweight and easy to carry around. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size considering the fact that it has the 5 inch screen. It fits easily into my smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Because the phone is so light, I carry it easily on my jeans with the pouch/case that I purchased for the phone.- STANDARD SIZED SIM CARD: Good to know as I did not have to cut my Sim card, I just placed it into the phone and it read my carrier plan and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.- Screen Resolution - For me personally, I find the resolution GOOD to VERY GOOD, however, it is not as good as say an S4 or S3, but good. However, I have a way to make the screen look GREAT and CLEARER on the home page. What I did is installed the free app ZEDGE and choose a wallpaper that has a dark blue background. The picture I choose has a deep blue sky and mountain in it and the home screen is STUNNING and the white letters on the icons really stand out. And I will say that the screen detail is clear and easy to read and webpages are just stunning on this phone!- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and if I am fairly close to the router, the signal strength is excellent. However, when I am a long distance from the router, the signal goes down, however, I still get WiFi and go on the Internet just fine. When not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T for data and easily get 3G and I have gotten 3G+ (there is no 4G in my area). The data is very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is.- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 64GB SD CARD) - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.- CAMERA - The 8MP takes excellent pictures. So I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised how clear the pictures are. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Turns out to be a pretty good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- No NFC (Near Field Communication) and also no OTG (On the go with cable adapter to plug USB Flash drive into to copy files). No problem as I use Dropbox to send files I want (pictures).- WiFi could be a little stronger, yet it connects quickly and I have never been without WiFi as it never failed me. Close to a router it gets 5 bars and very strong signal. When I am far away, one bar. So performed a test using my Tab 3 8.0 and Tab 2 10.1: Of course these gave me stronger signals because these devices are WiFi only and have probably a larger WiFi receiver inside. So I compared it to my S3 Mini and the signal was close, yet the S3 mini did have a little bit stronger signal.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Also, there is a newer Archived Flash out. So ask me in the comments if you need instructions and I will send them to you.- Very small instruction ""manual"" provided with the phone, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.Bottom line: Actual stars I rate this phone is 4.5 took off .5 stars because of the WiFi signal not as strong as my little S3 Mini or my Samsung Tablets. Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would because for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from this phone like the S3 or S4 models and also you want just the most important features and don't want to spend twice this amount for a fancier phone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.",16,5
Samsung,"Fantastic screen quality, great camera. This phone is faster and more efficient in battery consumption over the IPhone 4 I previously had. The sound quality is great while watching movies or just using the speaker phone. I strongly recommend this device for those looking for a smart phone but not willing to take out a private loan or second mortgage on their house.",251,5

Samsung,"I purchased this item new; however when it arrived the original seal on the box was broken, the charger color (white) did not match the color of the cell phone (grey) and the outlet adaptor was still a different color (black) and also did not fit properly.

Samsung,"This lasted 6 months and because I didn't understand the implications of an international phone, I am stuck. The seller won't help me and neither will Amazon. Don't Buy!",10,1
Samsung,Don't buy this phone it's a waste of money. It start to freeze up 3 days after I start using it,10,1
Samsung,"Excellent choice for a smartphone, fast, stable, lightweight and thin. Battery life as expected, basic accesories. I'm using it in Venezuela with Movilnet and Digitel, no problem. Plenty of memory for your apps.",75,5
Samsung,I love this phone. Its much better than the one I bought before. I have no idea how managed without this kind of phone but I am grateful for such a great phone. I hope to keep this phone for a lot longer time than before I have been lucky in the past with used phones to keep it for 6 months before it starts to mess up on me. But I am glad this was a brand new one that was perfect for what I needed it to do. Thanks to the Seller for such a wonderful phone.,37,5
Samsung,"Not a US compatible phone. While it will work with US carriers as just a phone, the product isn't compatible with some other Samsung devices. I purchased this with a Samsung Gear and according to Samsung this is a international phone that is not compatible and is not supported by Samsung US. I am going to have to return this and find a replacement.",31,1
Samsung,"I Like it! :DPros:- Outstanding Quad-Core Performance (like S5)- Great AF(Auto-focus) Camera with Flash- Can Add more storage (I used 32GB, and allows you to extend more apps and files)- Simple design HeadsetsCons:- None.I would like to recommend this Affordable phone to a friend.",20,5
Samsung,This phone freezes and closes out while using the browser and other apps. This is a waste if time and money,14,1
Samsung,"THIS CELLPHONE IS AMAZING. BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT!Update June 19, 2015:After three months using this cellphone I've realized that it has been a total mess with it. It freezes at least for three times a day, I have to reboot it. It can not run facebook or twitter because it always freezes and switching on wifi worsen the situation. My advice to those insteredted on buying this, do not buy it!!",15,2
Samsung,"I did not realize at the time of purchase that the phone had been giving people so many issues. I have had it for a few months and have gotten questionable use out of it, to say the least. At the time of purchase it sounded like a good phone, especially given that I cannot exactly afford the more expensive phones from Samsung. When I first got it, the phone worked like a charm, and was amazing. However, after having it a short while, I began to have major issues with freezing. When connected to the internet, it becomes extremely slow, and I often had to restart it by removing the battery. I also found out later that the ""8GB"" disk space your supposed to get is much closer to 5.5GB, which fills up very quick, contributing to the extensive lagging. I cannot return the phone, so I am going to get the most mileage I can out of it, and try to keep it offline as much as possible. It really is a shame that these issues make me dislike it as much as I do, since it does have a very nice screen resolution, two VERY nice cameras, and great speaker and call quality. It would make a great starter phone for your teen, but if you are one who uses your phone a lot, especially if it requires much internet, I would say keep shopping.",10,3
Samsung,"The phone arrived withing 4 days of the order....after having galaxy S3 for so many years this phone surprised me.....it's bigger in size, it's fast easy to work with...it was so easy to transfer my music/pictures/documents...I had this phone working/set up in 5 minutes to my liking....Camera quality is excellent... this phone is international and it workes with T-mobile or simple mobile providers....or any provider sponsored by T-mobile..",139,5

Samsung,"After having this phone for about 6 weeks, it is time for another review. After repeatedly failing to have internet connection without wi-fi, I went through a long and tedious on-line and then on-phone chats with T-Mobile, to try to ascertain the problem. Finally determined that because this phone is only 2G (a very slow connection), it will not work with T-Mobile's cell towers (which are 5G) for data purposes. How VERY disappointing!",10,2
Samsung,Worth every penny.,10,5
Samsung,I am satisfied of the outlook and operation of the phone. i do recommend it to any who look for fully pledged smart phone at reasonable cost.the package had been re-sealed as was informed by amazon for their pre-shipping check-ups. phone was brand-new and with international warranty. thanks for after-sales verification on the product by amazon. i bought item from cell floor.?ÿSamsung Galaxy Grand Prime DUOS G531H/DS 8GB Unlocked GSM Quad-Core Android Phone w/ 8MP Camera - White,10,5

Samsung,"I did not even need to open and use the phone. The phone was advertised as unlocked international version but it was clearly marked ""AMERICAN SIM CARD ONLY"" Sending it back immediately.",10,1
Samsung,Everything was perfect like I was expecting with this phone. This phone is amazing with all the features it has. The price is very cheap comparing to the same phones sold by some stores. You can use it either in USA or internationally.,87,5
Samsung,"This is the first dual sim dual standby phone that i used that really did the job compared with BLU, Lenovo and Sky that always hang or restarts. I should have just bought this in the first place rather than started with the less expensive unknown phones. The price, with this you get more than what you paid for. Better that the S3 or S4 and can compare to the S5.",84,5
Samsung,Great phone! Slick design with a good camera. My Dad's vodafone sim card works perfectly.,68,5
Samsung,"I'm 26 years old and have always despised cell phones... My wife basically made me buy smart phones. I am tech savy, so I did my research. Honestly I love this phone. It's processor is really fast... sometimes I have 9-10 apps open and it still runs smooth. The ""biggest"" game I've run on it is Vice City and it runs solid! Love this phone! The only issue I foresee in the future is the mirrored plastic rubbing off from me using it so much! Also it's been a pain trying to find a guide to root the phone, but i hope to figure it out soon. I have PSOne emulator running and it runs all the games smooth as butter. HIGHLY recommend this phone! And I can use it internationally? Five stars!",66,5
Samsung,"Although it was unlocked, it did not work with T-Mobile. T-Mobile tech. support said it is a foreign and will not connect to the network (after checking the sim card to make sure it was not the problem).",51,1
Samsung,"Beware, this phone is manufactured in Vietnam and Samsung USA will not give you a warranty. So if you purchase it you should purchase a square trade warranty for it.",51,3
Samsung,"Ordered it on a Saturday, got it three days later (Tuesday). Phone is in perfect condition and works great. Brand new. Comes with earphones and charger.

Again, arrived brand new, etc.",45,5
Samsung,"Update: I returned this purchase and bought the American version from the T-Mobile website, and it's world's better!!! No issues whatsoever, and a lot more options to customize. Keyboard is easier to use, camera is not pixelated, and overall processing is much faster. It's on sale right now! I got it for about $110, and it feels like a $300 phone.The screen of my Asus ZenFone2 broke and it started malfunctioning, so I was forced to buy a new phone. My sister and friend have this phone, and they said they like it a lot, so I went for it without putting in much research. People seem to be impressed by it, and the price is great. Maybe mine is faulty....This was a downgrade. I like the size, but that's about it. The processing is not too fast. The screen froze on the second day of having it, and I had to remove the battery to reset it. The touch calibration is awful (especially where the backspace button is). The keyboard isn't great, and it takes me about twice as long to get through a text than I used to. The back camera is decent, but the front camera is SO BAD. Grainy, pixelated pictures, even in good lighting.I think I will be returning this phone. Fingers crossed I'm able to...",12,2
Samsung,Fast and reliable,22,5
Samsung,I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old son. We purchased a prepaid plan from Family Mobile at Walmart. It was easy to set up the account. It has good quality pictures. He is able to use it for texting and talking. You can also download all of the latest apps. This is a great phone to have. The color is also a plus.,22,5
Samsung,I love this phone so much! it runs so smooth and has 4.16 GB of space when you first get it. I have a 8 GB card also for more space. but very fast in messaging and Internet. definitely a must have. don't listen to bad reviews. this is a great phone. Works wonderful with straight talk. activication kit for straight talk is 59.88 plus tax.,13,5

The only thing I don't like is that you cannot chose a background picture for your text messages like you can with the galaxy s three four. Other then tha this phone is awesome.",11,4
Samsung,"I first saw this phone on AT&T website. I found it on Amazon and decided to order it. It is a great little phone but there are a few things I don't like about it. First, the volume keys and on/off key is located opposite each other. When I want to turn the volume up or down, I always got the key on the other side that turns the screen on or off. That makes it frustrating. Would be a lot better if it was located in the top part of the phone. Second, when a call has ended the screen is black and you can't tell if the call has been ended or not. When you take the phone from your face, the screen should light back up, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. All these problems to me are really nothing major.Now there are a lot I like about the phone. It takes a great picture, the volume is great, plus I love how it has expandable memory. Great for holding lots of music and pictures. This phone is no iPhone but it is great for its price.",16,4
Samsung,"After reading some of the reviews about what this phone was lacking, I was a little afraid to order it, but I must say it has exceeded my expectations. You can barely tell a difference between the color brightness of this phone and other Samsung phones and it's surprisingly fast. Overall very good phone for the price.",77,5
Samsung,"This phone does not support mobile data. After contacting my mobile carrier i contacted samsung who informed me that this phone was made for India, not USA. So if you want to use mobile data don't waste yoyr money. In fact i want a refund but i don't see a contact for the seller.",39,1
Samsung,"This phone is immediately updated to Lollipop as soon as it's turned on, so no worries.Please forgive the terrible webcam quality, but I've now had this phone for about three weeks and I adore it.",25,5
Samsung,"A little pricey for last year's model, but cheaper than buying via a 2 year contract. Picture and title stated color as blue, description stated color as gray. Product shipped was gray. I didn't care which color I received, just thought it was confusing not knowing what color I was buying. Overall satisfied with purchase.",10,5
Samsung,"When the package first arrived, it contained a watch instead of the phone. I returned it, and the phone was sent to me. However, the glass screen had numerous cracks, the entire phone was scratched, and the port cover on the bottom (where charger attaches) was missing. As one of the main features of the ""Active"" model is that it is waterproof, the missing port cover rendered it useless. Since I really did want the phone (it was purchased as a gift for my son), I was willing to pay to have it fixed, and in fact made several attempts to find a local place to repair it. NONE of the places I checked with, including Radio Shack, would fix it. Some of them said they would fix other Samsung phones, but not the ""Active"" model. At first the seller tried to say that the description on Amazon said that the phone was cracked, and that it was ""as is"" and could not be returned. However, I immediately pdf'd a copy of my actual order, which said nothing about cracks and described the phone as in ""very good"" condition. I then returned the phone and received a refund.",24,1
Samsung,"I just received my Samsung SM-J120M/DS Galaxy J1 2016 Duos 4G LTE yesterday. If you want to know if this phone is compatible in a certain country check out frequencycheck on the web. Turns out this phone is compatible with 2G,3G,4G and 4GLTE in the US and many-many other countries while using 16 frequency bands. No CDMA bands on this phone though. Other more expensive phones like the Samsung G7 use 26 bands, but it also depends on the variant of that phone. i.e this is the Samsung Galaxy j1 2016 j120M/DS(North America version) there is also the J120FN, J120F/DS ,J120H/DS,and J120P variant. Each variant is made for a specific country or region. I dropped a star because it only has 8gigs of rom and 1 gig of ram. I would prefer at least 16 and 2, but that cost more. The phone seems to run just fine with 8 and 1 gig of ram though. Lollipop 5.1.1 runs at a quick pace the ability to multi task multiple apps . I read that Marshmallow can manage overhead memory better that Lollipop and has better power saving features, however I fear any possible marshmallow bugs and I'm quite satisfied with Lolli for the moment. I just let my phone perform updates today and it just modified lollipop it did not upgrade to marshmallow. I loaded temple run 2 and it takes a while to load, but runs smoothly. This phone came with about 3.6 gigs of free space out of 8 on the phone after the os, updates by user and factory installed apps. I did buy an external 32gb sd card as well. Apps will transfer to the sd card but only about 40% to 50%, this is a android issue, not the phone. The camera will id the sd card and use it for photos. Not too much bloat wear on this phone in my opinion. This phone is intended for North America, but after a five minute phone call(phone instructions) can be used internationally. I have not made that call yet. FYI beware of other vendors on Amazon selling the single sim version even though they advertise the duos version. A vendor told me that they had a mixed bag of single and double sim versions and would not be able to tell which type was shipped. The vendor Lifeline786 however did ship the correct dual sim to me. Good job Lifeline786! Be sure to contact the vendor prior to ordering.July 2016 Update: I traveled overseas(Indonesia) with this phone and used two different sim cards from two different companies. Both cards were able to give use 2g,3g, H+ and LTE in the overseas locations. However ATT tech support, here in the USA, was not able to affiliate the phones for LTE service. The tech said they didn't know why. We do get 2g,3g, H+ or 4G but no LTE with ATT. Also that five minute phone call needed to affiliate this phone in other countries is not really needed. We just worked with the sim card providers and they got our phone working. As far as using the phone, most apps work fine. Although memory management is required. Some apps take a lot of space. You only have about 4 gigs rom(plus sharing of space to the sd card) of space to use after the OS and factory software takes half of the 8gigs rom. Having only 1 gig of ram seems to be plenty I will often simply shut down apps running in the background and Lolipop OS 5.1.1 makes this easy.",22,4
Samsung,I have to return the phone due to it cann't detect my three SIM cards which work fine in my old Samsung phone. Please see the photo below about the detail.And I have to pay for the return fee.It wasted my time and money.,22,2
Samsung,"This is not an iphone, but it is cheap, functional, and it gives you all of the basic services/abilities that a good smartphone should offer. It is best for people who want or need a basic smartphone, but hate the idea of paying $600 for a name. I can confirm the claim that this phone is compatible with Republic Wireless once you purchase and install their sim card, and upload the series of Samsung updates - if you try to access the Republic app prior to updates, it will tell you that the phone is not compatible, so be patient. Mine required two updates prior to being recognized by the Republic app as compatible. All-in-all, this phone was exactly what I was looking for, at a reasonable price.",10,5
Samsung,"Works perfect with Republic Wireless' new Republic 3.0 BYOP plans. NOTE: You need to update the phone's firmware for it to become an ""Approved Device"" according to the Republic Wireless app. Until you update, it will simply say ""Unsupported Device"". Simply connect the phone to WiFi, goto apps/settings/about phone, and hit manual update if the updates don't fire off right away once it's connected to WiFi.",34,5
Samsung,"This is a perfect phone! Videos, texting, calls, all apps, so far work wonderfully! We went to the local AT&T store and got a new SIM card. We also purchased a 32g memory card here on Amazon. My husband uses this phone daily for work, and while he does not download many apps, so far it has not had any problems running multiple programs. THIS PHONE CANNOT BE BEAT FOR THE PRICE! This is the price ALL phones should reasonably cost!",13,5
Samsung,"So far so good, day 4. It's like my Samsung Note tablet but smaller. Previous phone was Nokia Lumina 635 ....this blows that out of the water. Fast enough for me, works fine with Cricket, although reception bars showing low most of the time but no trouble making calls or sending text. Some display settings are lacking IMO but nothing big enough to make me dislike the phone. Easy to use. Great camera, love that there's flash on front and back. Back of phone seems fragile but i use a case anyway so really doesn't matter much. Battery ran pretty low on day 2, have used on lowest brightness since and holding better. Came two days before expected arrival date, but took a lot more time than i thought it would. I have small hands so hard to use one handed but not a deal breaker. Overall I'm pretty happy with it so far.",11,5
Samsung,Best phone I've ever had. Perfect size. Graphics are so sharp. it has no bloatware. I didn't have to download half my apps because better ones came with the phone. It's so fast! OS Lollypop is way better than KitKat. Can be activated with T-Mobile flawlessly.I prefer this phone to all the iphones i have had. Camera and video are the best I've seen. I will be up all night playing with this phone. There are so many perks I cannot list them all. Highly recommend this phone!,37,5

Phone uses same size/kind of batteries (and overall looks like G4)It doesn't have automatic screen brightness (ambient light sensor), but I cannot say I liked how it worked in G4.Camera is on G4 level, OK...Everything else -- just works.

Samsung,"This is my first smartphone, I always had flip phones pre-paid, first virgin mobile (14 years) and now Tracfone (2 years) since I didn't have the need of internet on the phone and I still don't. As some people already said, the phone is made of plastic, which it doesn't bother me since the majority of previous cell phone were made of some sort of plastic and no one was complaining about it back then. I bought this phone 3 reasons, 1) The price. I spend about a month or more doing research, reading reviews and watching youtube videos about the phones. After all that, I have decided to get this one since I already have a samsung tables, computer monitor & tv so I knew I couldn't go wrong. 2) Even though this is an 8GB, 1.5GB RAM + microSD Slot Expandable up to 128GB, is pretty fast, excellent response and bright and good size. So far I like it a lot. And 3) The most important reason I got it is, since I have Tracfone pre-paid phone service I was able to transfer my tracfone number and balance to this phone with no problems at all. The best thing of all is I have a smartphone that it can do anything just like the iphone and all those expensive ones, go to the internet when I need to without the phone bill and saving hundreds a year. The minutes and data roll over every month when I don't use them. Can you say the same for you phone service? If you a monthly phone service and only browse the internet on occasion, this is the way to go.This is my initial review of the Samsung Galaxy J5 J500M. I will update the review 6 months from now.",26,5
Samsung,I was a little skeptical about buying this phone being that it was released in India and I live here in the U.S. but i love this phone!!!!! The camera is amazing front facing and rear. Shipping was fast too ordered on a Monday received Friday of that week. Love that it is just like an S5 but cheaper. This is the best phone I have ecer had. My previous phone was a Blu Studio 5.0 C but i dont regret the switch.,17,5
Samsung,"I have only started using my phone 2 days ago...so far the experience is greatI live in the Caribbean(Barbados) and I had no issues with the sim cards...was able to make calls as soon as the phone was set up. For music lovers like me, don't go looking for media as with other Samsungs....it's not there...the phone uses a Google music appPhone is carrying Android lollipop version and so far it's moving quick and smoothlyThe phone comes with a 13mp back camera but I have not been able to test the camera quality as yet... I took one selfie with the front camera at night an it came out pretty niceThe phone was delivered in the time frame it was supposed to and I had no issues with the sellerAll in all...so far I'm enjoying the Samsung Galaxy J5 experience",136,4
Samsung,This is an excellent product and content,87,5
Samsung,"Overall the phone is perfect for what I needed. I looked at everything locally from the Samsung Galaxy Core Prime to the iPhone 6s. This is my first smart phone and data plan. I upgraded from a 6 year old Motorola Quantico flip phone. I couldnƒ??t find what I wanted and I checked with my provider for compatibility and decided to order the GSM, Samsung J5, factory unlocked, international version because it had the features I wanted.SHIPPING: While browsing the website I found there were shipping restrictions on new cell phones due to the batteries. Amazon wouldnƒ??t ship outside the continental 48 states (Amazon wouldnƒ??t ship via air) so I had the phone shipped to a location I was going to visit in Washington State. I got a sim card from my local cell phone provider (not a large national company) before I left home and when the phone arrived I was there to receive it. BlutekUSA was the seller and Amazon fulfilled the order. I ordered it on 12/31/15. It arrived 3 days earlier than the estimate via UPS Ground from Virginia and was 7 days in transit.SETUP/USE: It was new in a factory sealed box and after setting the language from Hindi to English, installing the sim card and setting the APN (access point name) everything worked as it should in Seattle and later back home in Alaska. The APN setting can happen automatically but it didnƒ??t for me. I donƒ??t expect to be a heavy user but I tested most of the features. The processor is fast enough for running the available apps and the phone has a high resolution screen for photos, video and web browsing. With a fast cellular or Wi-Fi connection Netflix loaded really fast and ran in great looking HD. The front camera pictures are very good, 13 MP, and the internal storage, 8 GB, is sufficient for me. I added a 32 GB SD card but it can accept up to a 128 GB micro SD. I recommend looking at videos and the quick start or online manual so you know what youƒ??re getting and where to install the sim or sims (it will accept 2 sim cards for 2 phone lines) and micro SD memory inside the back cover of the phone.",79,5
Samsung,"I am one of those people who is not into paying exhorbitant amounts of money for a phone. All of my previous phones have been my siblings hand me downs and this is the first I ever purchase for myself. Me being me, I researched everywhere for what kind of phone will serve my purposes. Mostly I was aming for excellent camera that could photograph everything I have to show my coworkers later and also had a great reception for making and receiving calls in all seven floors of the hospital.This phone delivered.Not only am I super please with its performance at almost everything but I am amazed that one such phone can cost this price. And it has a high end finish and the gold color make it look amazing. Compared to my sister's iPhone 6 I'd say it almost does everything she can do with hers. It's light and sophisticated and has a quick response at everything I've done so far. Even better than hers is that this one holds two SIMs, which works perfectly with my life as I love to travel. So far I've tested two of my international SIMs and they both worked great.It's also my first android phone ever, as I'd previously only used the iOS softwares I was expecting a nightmare. It wasn't. It wasn't also exactly breezy but the phone is not to blame for that. Also I was pleasently surprised with the amount of apps you can get.The only thing though is, get an SD card. No matter how little you think you need it, you're going to need it.",43,5
Samsung,"Alright, before today, I really loved this phone.Camera is pretty great for its price, the system was not as bad, and it was nice for its size for one hand use.However, it has happened: it stopped working all together.I've only used it for 2 months and it failed on me.First it just heated up really bad when I was calling someone. Then, the screen didn't respond to my touch. Since it was heating up, I took out the battery to cool it down and placed it back again, but it was depleting the battery pretty bad. So I tried to charge up my phone, but it didn't charge my phone at all, but just heated my phone extremely bad.It eventually died on me, and now it became utterly useless since it wouldn't turn back on with charging (just heats it up).Thank god I am in Korea right now, since I could turn it in to the Samsung Service Center which they could fix it.... within 2 wks (hope so).So, I guess I learned my lesson: the less you spend money on something, the more likely there will be a problem.",11,2
Samsung,"The phone arrived in ALMOST perfect condition. I was satisfied that it looked and functioned like new EXCEPT for one major thing. The battery only charges to 60%. I've been charging this phone overnight and that is the maximum capacity of charging. The battery is is defective, which sucks because what's the point of having a phone that lasts only a couple hours?UPDATE: The phone does to 100% but charging time is much slower than expected. Especially having a lag-time of 6 hours overnight. Also, during the beginning of charge, the phone discharged more than it charged. Hopefully this is just a battery issue and not the phone itself. I'm still confused on how this happened, but it looks like it is charging fine now.In terms of the phone itself, some issues to look for:Camera: It does not automatically let you use panorama mode. Only a few options were available and you have to ""reset settings"" in the camera function to access that and other modes as well. I always have to reset it if I want to use those modes.Memory: The device has only 8 GB so definitely make sure you have an extra micro SD. I've only installed 3 apps--NPR, Skype, and Line--and it says that I've already used 2/3 of full storage.The product also says that there is a 24 month warranty, but after thoroughly reading the manual it does not seem applicable to the USA.",37,3
Samsung,"This phone is a very nice smartphone for the occasional user. If one looks at the memory used for the existing applications, it is about half full. So you won't be able to add a lot of extra apps, they may not fit in the 8GB memory. I added an extra memory card, but that only lets you store your pictures, music and only a few select apps. Most apps just install in the main memory. One nice thing in buying an unlocked phones is that it does not come with any bloatware from your cell phone carrier. But if you want you can install them yourself. The benefit is that you can also uninstall those, this is not possible with pre-installed apps from cell phone carriers.As this phone is for another market, be aware that when you boot it first time, it comes up in another language than English. This is not a problem, it is easy to figure out how to change it. I also found that the speed that the apps open and general usage is nice and fluid with no noticable slowdown. All in all a great phone for a non-power user. I am very happy with it.",21,5
Samsung,To me this is the greatest phone i ever had.. I fine it is really beautiful in colour and size.So if i had to purchase it again i would. The pictures are clean and plus it has a flash in the front and in the back. The filling of the phone is lightweight and the battery is removale.To me this is better than any Samsung s4 or s5.,20,5
Samsung,Great phone! I ordered the unlocked version to work in Trinidad and Tobago and it works great and looks very nice. No problems at all and I have had the phone about 4 months now and still no complaints or issues.,14,5
Samsung,Excellent phone! Completely exceeded my expectations! Works even better than the Galaxy S5 I had which kept resetting on me and going haywire. Just an all around excellent phone for an excellent price. The company who shipped it has also been diligent in emailing from time to time to check my customer satisfaction which I totally appreciate. 5 stars all around ???,12,5
Samsung,"To all those wondering if this phone is unlocked for international use, the answer is no. I received one and it clearly stated on the phone package the it is for use only in America. I put an international SIM card it the phone but it didn't work. Usualy it works on other internationaly unlocked phones. The word factory unlocked in the product description is kind of misleading and the seller doe not clearly state it is for use in the US. So I had to get it unlocked for international use. Cost me $35 extra. Other than that the phone is good.",12,5
Samsung,"This is one of the best middle range phone in the market today, great price and high quality results. Just be sure you buy the 16 gb version otherwise it wouldn't be that good. It's fast, slim, nice camera (both of them, the front flashlight it's great) and the battery easily last the whole day of normal use. Didn't contact the seller but the product came as described and in perfect condition. I'm a happy buyer.",22,5

Samsung,"Update October 26th 2016This is disgusting. I have really enjoyed this phone until Samsung decided to install a 500 megabyte application that I cannot remove called Samsung text-to-speech. I am really mad. I have never seen such an incompetent act in my entire life! Do not buy this phone if you have any intention of controlling how much memory is available to you. The least they could have done is allow me to remove this stupid piece of software, since I do not use it.I was not an Amazon customer for the J5 8 GB model but I did review it and gave it 1 star. The problem with that device is that Samsung chose to deal with Microsoft on their products, and installed all kinds of ""bloatware"" that I don't need on my phone. They do this in such a way that the software can't be removed from storage, and left the device with very little extra room. It's possible to recover a little space by moving your own installed software to the SD card, but don't bother to download any maps from Google because, after installing a few extra packages, you wind up with only 1 GB of storage left, and half of that would be taken up by your downloaded maps.The 16 GB model doesn't seem to have these issues--at least, not yet. After restoring from the 8 GB model, I have almost 9 GB left for maps and such. Because of this, I now think it's a good time to review the phone on its merits. Nevertheless, I intend to make lots of noise, should that company continue to add more applications I can't remove.The phone is very slim, and fits nicely in my pocket, even with my glasses and the protective case (third-party item.) The camera is excellent, in my opinion, and the display and colors are great. I've heard about dead pixels on some devices, but i haven't seen any on this one yet. Phone calls are clear, and the WIFI is sensitive enough for my needs. It produces a good output signal for headphones (I never use the ones supplied by manufacturers of these phones,) and also through auxiliary inputs to stereo systems. With 128 GB of microSD storage, I can carry all my music with me. I use the Facebook app a lot, as well as Uber and Ventra, without any trouble. Battery life is good.This is not a review of Lollipop, with which I have some bones of contention, particularly with regard to the microSD card; however, I've always been able to get around those by ""sneaker net,"" And with 8 GB on board storage, it shouldn't be too difficult to move content across to the microSD card using a computer.Fortunately, I was able to simply switch the SIM card from the old phone to the new one without a hitch.This is a very fine phone, for the price,and I highly recommend it, but Samsung ought to be prepared for dropping stars if they persist in installing non-removable bloatware and taking up valuable storage space from important programs related to travel and so on. And if they ever fix this issue on the 8 GB model, I will give it 5 stars also.",39,1
Samsung,I am very disappointed because this cellphone does not support LTE as is advertised. This is the SM-J700H (Russian version) version and supports 3G only. Also my unit came with a power adapter that did not fit in the European power brick.,10,1
Samsung,"HI all,The product is being advertised as LTE and is not,I checked the model number which is SM-J700H and apparently this model does not have LTE, apparently the model if you own LTE is the SM-J700M http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-J700M-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B015I0OSJA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1451240504&sr=8-2&keywords=smj700m",10,2
Samsung,Let me start about how highly disappointed i am with this phone. This phone is advertised as a dual sim but yet the other sim slot is blocked. The mere reason i bought this phone is to have 2 sims in it. I went to cut my sim cards only to get a disappointment that 1 of the sim slot is blocked. PLEASE save yourself the headache and disappointment of buying this phone here. It is a very nice phone but it defeats the purpose of buying a dual sim. FALSE ADVERTISING DO NOT BUY,41,1
Samsung,The second sim card slot for the phone I received is sealed shut. I can't get it opened and the main reason I bought this phone is for its dual sim capability and good reviews. So upset.I finally heard back from the seller and was told to return the phone for a replacement but I decided to keep it even though it had only one sim slot. This was a big mistake!!!! The phone is locked and not compatible with sims outside the country. Gave the phone to my sister as a gift and now she can't get it to work in Nigeria. This is so annoying!!!!!,18,1

Samsung,"If you're in the US and on ATT and are looking for a relatively inexpensive smartphone without a contract, this might just be it. I've tried some of the cheaper brands that Amazon sells. Phones intended for sale in the US from BLU, Huawei, and ZTE. All budget phones under 300 dollars. And then someone mentioned the Samsung J7 to me on another forum so I watched a bunch of videos and learned all I could. What I found was a phone far more capable at gaming that any other budget priced phone, and also a phone that happens to look quite premium. Outside of games it also performs pretty darned well. I'm very impressed.Here's what you give up when you decide to get this phone:- Ambient light sensor. Not a big deal to me. When I'm inside I keep my phone at about 20 percent brightness. When I go outside I use the Outdoors brightness option that this phone has and it performs beautifully. Much nicer than any of the other budget phones I've used outdoors.- Notification light (I kinda miss this, but it's not a huge deal)- Glass back (I don't care about this)- backlit keys on the bottom of the phone (I would like those, but after an hour or two your brain remembers exactly where those buttons are.The version of the phone I bought was the J700m. It's intended for use in the Americas (South and North). When you turn it on, it selects Spanish as the language for the phone, but it lets you scroll up and select English. From that point on everything is in English. Put your sim card in prior to turning it on the first time. I put my ATT sim in slot 1 (the slot to the right with the memory card slot immediately above it) and a memory card right above it and then booted up the phone. After a quick setup, I was into the phone and downloading my apps. I told Spotify to use the mem card to store music and it did it. Same for my podcast app. It's a cheap way to conserve the precious internal storage. Some other reviews of this phone at Amazon have stated it doesn't work with ATT. That's completely untrue. This version of the phone works beautifully with ATT. My LTE speeds are incredible. No problems whatsoever.Ive never used a phone with Touchwiz on it before but I read a lot of complaints about it. Personally I love it so far. It's incredibly configurable. You can change the entire look of the phone by adding new themes, of which there are a ton of free ones on the Samsung store. Some reviewers have mentioned that the phone as a lot of bloatware. Also untrue. My phone had the usual Google apps and a couple from Microsoft (like Onedrive). There were no Game demos etc. Of the 16 gigs of internal storage, I had about 11 gig free when I turned it on for the first time.Bottom line is that this is a great budget/mid-range phone that is built to handle the networks in the Americas. For me that means ATT. I couldn't be happier with the phone.Update #1:Battery life after the first few days is incredible. It only has Lollipop 5.1.1 on it but when the screen is off (especially at night), it consumes almost no battery. I sleep for about 8 hours and when I wake up, 1 percent has been used. That's amazing. My iPhone would lose 10-20 percent battery life over the same period. Again, this doesn't have Marshmallow so there's no Doze feature. This is just the native OS managing battery.Also a cool feature that I've not seen on other phones is a manage memory app that Samsung includes. Using it clears all apps from memory and frees up as much space as possible for you. This has been incredibly useful.Update #2: I don't use a case or screen protector. One of the knocks against this phone by some reviewers was the lack of gorilla glass and what that would mean in regards to fingerprints and scratches. Well someone tested the glass online and it had the same scratch resistance as phones with Gorilla Glass 3 do. As for being a nasty fingerprint magnet like my last phone (the lackluster Honor 5X), it isn't. In fact it's resistant to fingerprints in a way that I haven't experienced on a phone or tablet before. I'm not sure how they're doing it, but it's impressive. Every few days I hit it with a cleaning cloth, but not because the fingerprints are out of control. Just to make it look brand new again.I'm also very pleased with the feel and weight of this phone in my hand. It feels incredibly premium despite not being a metal phone. Also, the buttons have a great feel to them as well. The more I use the phone, the more impressed I am with what Samsung has delivered here for 250 dollars. And once again, the gaming performance is tremendous and better yet is that my phone has never heated up while gaming. I also love the customizability of the theme store.",96,5
Samsung,Its LOCK....it only for gsm US sim card....Not unlock for global world wide gsm....,10,1
Samsung,"I provided this same review for my phone, which is the same phone in black. This is my wife's phone. Wonderful phones at less than half the price of the Galaxy S7. Fast processor. More than enough storage at 16GB vs. 32GB on the S7. And the RAM is 2GB vs. 4GB on the S7. Both have expandable micro SD capabilities. The resolution and pixel count is higher on the S7, but how important is that on a 5.5 inch screen (J7) vs. only 5.1 (S7). The images and video on the J7 are beautiful, and when I cast them to our home TV's they are as good as or better than what Prism TV offers. The cameras are nearly identical. Other than a few high-end teasers like Corning Gorilla Glass, Image Stabilization, water ""resistance"", and optional wireless charging, all only available on the S7; I, as a responsible adult cell phone user, who does not use the device for business purposes, can find NO REASON whatsoever to foolishly spend the $$ on the S7. I bought my wife and I each a new phone for less than one Galaxy S7. And I am the average user of music, movie, sports, and shopping apps. Trust me this phone is fine.",10,5
Samsung,"Good phone, great buy for the money. I wanted a premium phone without paying $500 or more, this phone meets my expectations, but don't expect a great camera. Would I like it to shoot as nice of photos as the S6, you bet, does it? No way. But for the $250 or more I saved, I can live with that. Make sure you get the M or F models. One reseller sent me the H/DS model which is cheaper and has different screen and processor even though it was listed as a 700F. Most people may not notice that, but there is a difference. Samsung makes different versions of the J7 for different regions of the world. Avoid the H/DS version, it doesn't have as good a display or processor.",75,4
Samsung,"I love everything about this phone. It works perfect 95% of the time. The problem is that on occasion the media/main speaker on the back of the phone will turn off and all sound will emit from the small phone speaker on the screen side. This is fixable by restarting the phone which takes maybe 15 seconds tops. I love the screen size, its comparable to the iPhone 6. Very customizable interface, as Android always is. Never have a problem with apps closing or freezing. Long battery, especially with the power save option. With regular use (using apps, internet, GPS, calling and texting), I can make the battery last an entire weekend. Camera is also great quality, front and back, ans has a lot of built in editing. I would recommend this phone to anyone.",58,4
Samsung,Wow I can't say much more than that about this phone. It took me awhile to finaly lay my hands on one. These phones Galaxy J7 are awesome dual sim cards micro sd card slot up to 128 gb. Samsung needs to sell these in the States. You can find them on Amazon but be prepaird to wait they sell out as quick as they get them in. Is unlocked works great with T Mobil or Metro PCS and other carriers(check with carrier you use). I read a review on Amazon and I was hooked. Removeable battery better than 6 Edge or others expandable memory. Very good price $ 230 to 270$. Do your homework you cant beat this phone for the price and what it can do.,42,5
Samsung,"When i recieved the phone, IT WAS NOT DUAL SIM as the description said.",11,1
Samsung,"For those of you in the US with AT&T this phone works perfectly. I could not be happier. My iPhone 6s Plus was having issues, so I decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy J7. When it arrived I popped in the Sim from my iPhone 6s Plus (With an adapter iphone has a nano, J7 is a micro) and turned on the phone. It came up perfectly, no configuration required. Even the tethering worked. If I had to say what are the cons the only thing I have found so far is the inability to turn off the shutter sound on the camera. I was worried about the camera quality because the iPhone is the gold standard, but changed the J7 to pro mode adjusted the iso even in low light the photos are good (if you leave it in auto I get too much noise in low light)I purchased an extra battery so I have a spare, a case on Amazon and the SD card 128GB.Would I buy it again, absolutely! The cost of my 128GB iphone 6S Plus was nearly $1000, this phone has similar performance, removable battery, SD slot and Dual SIMs for about $250 + $30 SD Card. Very Pleased!",23,5
Samsung,"I really love it. It is an excelente phone and much cheaper than the S series. The flash in the front camera is unique. Worth the price. A bit heavy, though. And the gold version is cute. Highly recommendable. Even for men. Fits in the pocket as well although it's not that small",13,5
Samsung,"Brilliant cell phone! Fast, snappy, works well with plenty of useful apps.If you like to record your phone calls, some phones do not have the direct link to the received signal and need to use the phone microphone to record what the speaker says. Not this one, it records straight from the insides of the system very clearly. Of course you have to use the right App (I'm using Galaxy Call Recorder) but if you read that some phones have ""issues"" or need to turn the volume fully up to record calls, this one is not one of them. It records beautifully.On top of that dual sim, can take a 128GB micro SD card (some phones go up to 32 or 64), great screen, 13MP camera.Absolutely fantastic phone at a great price. I cannot tell what a more expensive model can offer that this one doesn't.",13,5
Samsung,I am very pleased with this phone. The fonts the themes the size of the phone and definitely the camera. (Mainly the clarity and front flash) Everything Is perfect. Upon receiving the phone I had to get a new Sim card from at&t because my iPhone 5 Sim card was too small. However the representatives at at&t couldn't connect the internet. I was initially mad upset distraught everything u would imagine. So I got home and immediately came home and contacted costumer service. They were very helpful and assured me that the phone is compatible with at&t. They gave me some tips on resolving the issue. I don't know what I did exactly but I did get the internet working and over all I'm enjoying my new phone. I highly reccomend this phone to anyone looking for something new.,13,5
Samsung,"This phone is absolutely phenomenal. I am very pleased with this purchase If you are a true techie and or just feel like you just have to pay $800-$900 for iPhone or the new Samsung Galaxy S7 you go right ahead. Of which neither one of those phones offer a dual SIMs card slots so that you can have both a personal or business line in one phone the technology is superb. Please pay attention and be aware that there are two models of this phone the j700h and the j700M/DS please do not make the mistake and order the j700h like I did to later realize that it was a older model once I realize the mistake I immediately cancel that order & ordered the correct model j700M/DS. Definitely read the information so that you won't make that mistake I almost mad but, I was fortunate enough to stop the payment of the initial order and then order of the correct phone. Like it says in the description this phone does not come with the Gorilla Glass but ordered a package of Gorilla Glass to fit this phone and it works perfectly problem solve. But again I want to reiterate thatyou need watch for the model number to be sure that you are getting the correct phone this phone is equivalent and better than the Samsung Note series. This is a great phone!!! I also wanted to mention that the J700M/DS is 4G LTE and that the j700H/DS is only 3G.",19,5
Samsung,"Before buying this phone, I bought and returned 2 other phones: ZTE and Honor 5x. This one, the J7, is a keeper. I can't see anything negative about it so far.Appearance: looks great, perfect 5.5"" basic HD display. Because it's plastic rather than metal, it's not heavy. It's very slim so can fit nicely in your pocket or small handbag.Performance: finally a phone that pairs and keeps Bluetooth connection, rather than drops it after 10 minutes (which plagues many Android 5.1 devices). Reception seems fine, not better or worse than other phones, my signal showing around -73, the same as other phones. Call quality was perfect, clear, loud on speakerphone, and the other party had no difficulty hearing me either. It has been documented that plastic phones are better than metal when it comes to signal. As I look for a phone that works well as a ""phone"" rather than everything but, signal and call quality are super important to me.Camera: can't go wrong with 13 mp back camera. Clear, sharp photos that you can edit with the help of many photo apps out there. And because of the nice, crisp screen, your photos look good.Battery: 3000 mAh seem to last forever. It comsumes Zero power at night on standby. Charged it to 100% before going to bed and in the morning it's still 100%.I like the fact that is has a micro sim (2 slots) rather than the invisible nano, which I will probably lose within 2 seconds of handling it never to be found. Huge expansion storage on micro sd card, which cleverly slides on top of sim 1 to save space.My phone was purchased ""used, like new"" from JP Mobiles, arrived very fast, as new looking as can be. It was a little over $200, which is great price for a fantastic phone, when you think that people shell out a thousand bucks for a phone that may not be any better than this one.",18,5
Samsung,Great phone but you must choose a carrier and then go through a lengthy coding process to have it connect to internet since it is unlocked. I finally found the right person at Att and he gave me the codes. The store did not. Also it is hard to find a case for it.,10,5

Samsung,"I've been using this phone for a few weeks now and I'm quite happy with it so far. I needed a very fast replacement after I shattered my old phone. I was not about to pay upwards of $600 for one of the Galaxy S models, and I feel that this is a great lower-cost model actually. It's very functional. The camera is quite nice, it's got GREAT battery life (I can go 2 days without charging if I'm not constantly texting or answering emails), the speed is good (though maybe I'm just not used to a phone that actually works as opposed to a phone that was reaching the end of its planned obsolescence) and overall I'm happy with it. The issues I have are minor functionality things that I'm not happy with, all small annoyances, but my previous phone was also a Samsung model so that's my frame of reference. For example, if there are many notifications from different apps, they will not all show up on the lock screen, and I will think I do not have any or that I only have a notification from one app (my old phone used to list the number of notifications if there were many accruing) so I really don't like that as it has caused me to miss messages when checking my phone in a hurry. The alarm can only be snoozed in 5 min intervals a max of 3 times (I find this silly and irritating) whereas my previous phone had custom snooze options. Finally I have found that about 40% of the time, notifications don't show up at all, which is a strange bug with this phone. Oh, and a side note to all the other women reading this: it BARELY fits in standard back pockets (definitely not going to fit in a front pocket), particularly after I put a case on it, so that may be a consideration for you. However, all in all I am happy with it.",18,4
Samsung,"I love this phone. It has all that I am interested in having on a cel phone. Pictures are great, even selfies. It does have a flash on the front that works less as a flash and more as a flashlight but does the trick anyway. It also has a decent amount of memory so that I can load it up with the most common apps. The screen is large and the colour is different and very pretty.Up to now, it has worked for me very well.",16,5
Samsung,"i've had this for 5 days now and so far its great the camera is good 13mp and the front camera is 5 mp but what makes it great is the front flash,i like the size of it, internal memory 16 gb you only get about 8 or 9 gb. over all it functions as well as any s5 or s6 basic Samsung functions but the price great.i use mine on metropcs had to call them to let them add it to their network which is free and i do get Lte speeds with it which is excellent.",16,5
Samsung,"This is an AMAZING phone. When I bought it, my mom almost didn't let me, because she thought since it was so low priced, it would be bad. DO NOTE, THAT THE SELLER IS RAISING THE PRICE, AND I BOUGHT MINE FOR $204 ABOUT A WEEK AGO. NOW IT WAS $245.So I am saying, if the price goes down, GO FOR IT.There are two SIM card slots, so you can add extra memory, and not worry about having not enough space.Imagine.. 128GB of storage space.. The possibilities are ENDLESS!Also, the processing speed is flawless, you can play games on there as well as any other.The camera works well, if you are expecting a g7x camera in a phone then that's your problem. It's just a phone.But a REALLY great thing about this phone- it has front camera flash! Amazing! A Samsung Galaxy s5 doesn't even have that.It comes with 16GB memory, which is excellent for a phone, you can actually do stuff.Another good thing-This phone doesn't load you up on extra apps, only one page! it does come with a folder with Microsoft word, PowerPoint, etc. but that can just be deleted. I'm talking about undeletable apps.TO ALL YOU T-MOBILE USERS, YES! IT WORKS WITH T-MOBILE!you can use 4G LTE or 4G with T-Mobile and you can use data outside, and make calls, texts, etc.This is a fully functioning phone.It is almost as big as a Samsung Galaxy note 4 , only smaller by about a centimeter, and it's as a big as an iPhone 6+. Ayye.The screen is amazingly clear, and the brightness is phenomenal.The sound quality is really good, and unless you want to blast music around the entire city, the sound volume suffices.The RAM is 1.5GB, which is really good for a $204 phone.The phone doesn't heat up at all, and it maintains a steady room temperature, no matter how much you used it.When my phone arrived, it was definitely new. It had never been opened, and there was still plastic protectors on the screen and on the side. Not a smudge.The battery was wrapped up nicely out of the phone, and it came with 50 percent charge in it. This lasted me all day!It DID come with a charger and earbuds, but the charger was universal. ITS OKAY THOUGH , because it came with a peice to match the wall sockets. This could be seen as a plus, though, because this means that you can use this charger around the world. You can also use the phone itself around the world, too since its international!The earbuds came a little wonky.. One earbud chord size was was much to short, but it's okay, because it was generous to even include earbuds in the first place.OOOH OOH AND THE THEMES!!!YES!!!They're amazing! You can use themes to change the ENTIRE look of your phone. It changes the font, the s Rene color and pattern, and even the looks of the applications and. Decorates the insides of the apps. The keyboards could look different, and you could have clouds instead of chat bubbles in the messaging app, with a tebddy bear pink background. Ooh.There are also MANY themes for free. They do have payed ones, but you can find NO problem at all finding ten really cute free themes.This phone does work in America!Have FUN with this phone.This phone really is unlocked, so you can use any carrier.Go buy this phone now, and have no doubts in your head, because it is AMAZING.-Pictures attachedP.S I lost the black part for the charger that turns it into a normal charger but yes, it does come with one. Omg I lost it already....",174,5
Samsung,I love everything about this phone. I purchased this to replace my Samsung S3 after I dropped it. The S3 is the size of the display screen on the J7 so I'm still adjusting to the larger size phone. The phone I received is exactly as described - dual SIM slots and a memory card slot. I purchased this in gold and the color is exactly as shown on Amazon. The phone is unlocked and works perfectly in the Bahamas and I had no issues setting it up. I received a brand new phone in a sealed box 2 days after ordering it on Prime. The seller also sent an email offering any support that may be needed. I would definitely recommend this phone.,133,5
Samsung,Was unable to marry it with my wireless router. No help from Samsung - they support only US models in this country. Suggested to call Vietnam where the device was manufactured. After 3 days of trying all tips and tricks from the Internet had to return the device.,10,1
Samsung,U.S. customers be careful... THIS IS NOT A 4G / 4G LTE PHONE. The seller is misleading in saying this. The phone is great but will not be as fast if you are paying for 4G plan.,10,1
Samsung,"I am not really a Samsung person but my mom really wants this specific model. After a month of using it temporarily, I can say that it's a very good phone with a long battery life. You don't even need to tinker much with the settings. Its ""Smart Manager"" does a pretty good job.RAM wise, I don't know if it's for everyone. I have so many apps that I'm too lazy to uninstall so I'm already using 70% of the 1.5GB. Even then the phone is working smoothly. In my mom's case, 1.5GB is enough but I might need more than this.If I have to choose between RAM and battery life though, I'd choose battery life next time. Just bought a Moto X pure edition with 16GB, 3GB RAM but the Samsung still beat Motorola by a mile. I don't know though if it's because I upgraded the Moto to Android M. Good thing, I only paid $300 for the Moto X Pure edition (vs $250 for the Samsung J7 in Feb).Warranty-wise, I was trying to register the international J7 version on the US website but I could not find the model there. It says that if it's not a US model then I have to register on the international website. Even after several times, I wasn't able to register the phone successfully on the Phil website. I might end up trying to call them about it.headphone plug is at the bottom -- I prefer it on the top.I like the ""Outdoor"" setting so you can see the screen outside.I am not an expert but I like the graphics and sound quality.Samsung J7 is an excellent phone! I might end up with a Samsung next time.UPDATE:When I brought this home to the Philippines in April I put in a local micro-SIM card in one of the slots and it worked immediately. So far my mom has no issues with the phone. The only risk is that this phone has no warranty in both the US and the Philippines. A Samsung Service Center in the Philippines said that that they only provide warranty to locally purchased phones. They can still fix the phone of course for a price.",88,5

Samsung,DOES NOT HAVE 4G LTE ! Be careful when you are buying this phone. It does not have 4G LTE. It only has WCDMA which is at best 3.5G. There won't be any new WCDMA towers in the United States so if you have a data plan you will be wasting it buy buying this phone. AGAIN PHONE DOES NOT HAVE 4G LTE your data will not be as fast it will be slower then a freaking IPHONE 5 WHICH CAME OUT IN 2012 because that phone has LTE. NOT a GOOD phone at all. The seller LIED on the question and answer portion and said it has LTE. I tried to use this phone for UBER and LYFT and I got kicked out of my service because the data connection was so slow !,46,1
Samsung,"Excellent phone, works well. Only downfall is that Samsung could make the ringer a little louder. Was delivered in five days and I live in the Caribbean! Would definitely order from this company again.",42,4
Samsung,"I received the product 2 days ahead of schedule. Great. However, the receiver speaker does not work from first use. The product was sold as ""New"". I don't believe Samsung to make phones with 100 year old technology, such as receiver speakers, to not work New out of the box. I believe this phone to be Refurbished.",11,1
Samsung,Omg it's NOT a NEW PHONE!! I has found lots of record of past user.,11,1
Samsung,Better than I expected. Boyfriend had tons of Samsung phones before and I bought this as a present. It's about the size of the iPhone 6 Plus and just packed with features. It's one of the best phones out there without buying an S7. Definitely worth it.,35,5
Samsung,"I am very disappointed about my purchase! Recently, i bought 2 smartphones galaxy J7 (gold color and white color), but one came damaged. It was a gift for my husband, until yesterday he opened de box (the box was sealed) and when he turned on the phone, we saw that the screen has a knock and it has a dead pixel. I am in Honduras, here it is very expensive to repair screen because there is not parts for this model or difficult to find places that can to do this. The gold phone is ok...I would like do not have bought this!Samsung Galaxy J7 SM- J700H/DS GSM Factory Unlocked Smartphone-Android 5.1- 5.5"" AMOLED Display- International Version (White)",33,1
Samsung,"Over all it is a good phone.Pros:Size as big as an iphone6 +.Cost much less than iphone.2 sim cards , 2 numbersmemory card. which is a big plus since you can store all your files without worrying about not enough space on your internal drive.cons: no fingerprint accessstill not a big deal.",30,5
Samsung,The wrong charger to charge the phone. I need a regular charger please,22,1
Samsung,I'm very disappointed with this phone because it doesn't support LTE or 4G,13,1
Samsung,This phone is everything I have no problems with this device easy to use fast response.my favorite thing is the camera off course i am a selfie junkie and that camera gives me life.,20,5
Samsung,Please be aware this product is the international version for the 3G use and there is no one year of Manufacturer warranty. I purchased this product on 6/9 and started to have the screen problem after six weeks of the purchase and the seller International Mobile inc. told me there is no any warranty to fix or replace the item.,14,1
Samsung,"This mobile is exceptionally good with all it's features and performance.Camera quality is excellent with 13 MP and 5 MP. I just don't carry my digital camera after getting this mobile as the pictures are clear.Audio is good.Dual sim option is another feature which attracted me towards this mobile. I was using 2 mobiles and need to get rid of one s it is difficult to maintain 2 mobiles. And this one, as advertised, is working well with 2 SIM cards / networks.It's been few months now I started using this mobile and didn't find any issues with it till date.Happy that I own a fantastic mobile for a decent price.Definitely recommended.",18,5
Samsung,"Purchased this unlocked International phone as I live in the Caribbean and needed a phone that was compatible with Digicel. It arrived quickly, well packaged - with adequate instruction manual (kudos to the seller).The phone is user friendly, my 13 year old daughter began instructing me very sternly on how to use it . This is my first smart-phone and I visited Busch Gardens and Sea World with my daughters. I was amazed at the clear crisp photos and videos it was able to take. The phone itself feels substantial in my hands and it is not easy to slip out if you hold it carefully. Have used it for a few months with no issues.",16,5
Samsung,"Althouth the phone was in a sealed box, after I opened I saw a fingerprint with a white smudge on the film of the back cover. The screen worked for a while then stopped later it appeared back but for short period of time. It was unstable. Maybe it is battery was defective since when I connected the phone to a pc via usb cable the screen came back but again it worked sometime then went blank. So, I returned it. The seller told me that they were going to replace with a new one. I think I was unlucky!",16,1
Samsung,Great condition the only problem is that I have o I'm missing something to be able to plug in my phone into the wall,11,4
Samsung,The phone works with almost all carriers and the seller was great answered all my question. The phone is great absolutely love it! Will buy from seller again!,12,5
Samsung,"I received my phone on time as promised. I was nervous to have spent that amount of money for a phone by just reviewing pictures online. But was very pleased after I received it. It looks new no damage, this phone is indeed huge. Just what I wanted I LOVE IT!",31,5
Samsung,I enjoy the much larger screen than my previous galaxy s5. I have had no issues with this phone. I get about the same battery life as I did with s5. It is preinstalled with all of AT&T's junk apps that can not be removed but you can disable them.,30,5
Samsung,This is my third Samsung Galaxy phone since they started making smart phones.Pros: Love the big screen and larger keyboard since I have larger fingers than a womans fingers. It has all the features of the other Galaxy phones such as S4. Seems to be built reasonably solid. It will still fit in my shirt pocket too. It has replaceable battery and extra slot for storage card.Cons: Batter life could be better with a upgrade to a bigger battery if available. The screen is 720 dpi I believe. My S4 phone videos seems to be just a tad better but this one is good only a gamer would probably care. This ones processor seems to lag more than my S4 but then it could b do to internet download speed from the cell phone towers. The note is probably a better phablet but this screen on this is awsome with it's huge size. I got the unlocked version so i could choose the best carrier and phone deals too which is a plus for me. One thing to note as with most smartphones a lot of blot ware is pre installed so be careful what additional apps you install. This phone has the 16 gb internal storage don't buy one with 8gb internal storage or you will soon run out of storage unless you ad a storage card to the device.,26,4
Samsung,Works well on metro pcs and love the big screen will recommend this to anybody that loves big screen phones,25,5
Samsung,"I was skeptical about this being refurbished. I've had this phone two days and it works great and there were zero defects, scratches or blemishes. I would rate the phone I got at 10 out of 10, it's that good. Big beautiful display. I use Straight Talk and this phone is 4G LTE. Great call quality. Shipping was also very fast. I ordered on Monday night and received Wednesday @ 3:00 pm with two day shipping.",13,5
Samsung,My daughter bought this phone and she loves it!! Says everything she needs is right where she needs it. .easy to use.,14,5
Samsung,make sure you buy drop warranty.. the screen is very fragile.. it will crack even when dropped within 1 feet.,17,4
Samsung,"What a savings buying it as a refurb! One thing happened though that turned out to be easily resolved: my PC didn't recognize the phone when it was connected. I was on the phone for 2 hrs with Samsung but they couldn't help me. I finally decided to call the Seller thinking I got a defective phone but I was so wrong. I should've called him first! He answered from his cell phone & knew exactly what to do. He walked me through a couple steps, undoing what they needed to do to unlock the phone. (""Dial"" *#0808# & then the USB settings come up. Changed it to MTP+ADB & that's it!) We're good to go. He was very professional & asked me to call him first if i have any other issues.I was able to insert my T-Mobile SIM card & everything has been working great.",16,5
Samsung,"Wanting a over sized screen to eliminate having to carry around a 7-8"" tablet and a phone, I decided I needed a phablet would be a good option and I couldn't be happier. I tried out the Note 3, the Sony Z Ultra, HTC One Max and the Nokia 1520 and each of them were great in one way or another, but ultimately it was very obvious that I favored the Mega 6.3 over them all AND it was the cheapest! No amount of money can buy a better phone, believe me I tried to top this and simply couldn't.I can't possibly explain how much I enjoy this phone. Hands down, this is the best phablet available. LOVE IT!",12,5
Samsung,"Purchase this phone because of the size, now the touch screen is not responding properly, I hit the a key and may get ""ap"" or ""al"" or a whole string of characters, it backspaces or dbl spaces at random.Contacted Samsung and was informed that this is a Korean phone by its identification numbers and that they do not support it. The tech also informed me that Samsung doesn't make this phone even tho their name is all over it.We are in the process of contact with the seller to resolve this now. will update as I receive more information.",10,1
Samsung,"This is my 1st smart phone and I just love that the SOBs come without user manuals. But I am slowly hacking my way through it and am amazed! Its a great size for the old and 1/2 blind. If it doesn't quit on me, I think it and I will be joined at the hip. The only thing which has happened is that I could not get it to ring on incoming calls. Tried everything. Must have finally hacked my way through it because it rings now.??? But I did not like the store mgr. e mailing me and verbally attempting to get me to get rid of my seller review. That is unacceptable behavior. I was unhappy when I wrote it because I could not get the phone too ring. Don't EVER bully me or I will report you to Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,5
Samsung,I bought a samsung mega 5.8 in October for my self and another mega 5.8 for Christmas for my husband. Both of them are running on Straight Talk. All we had to buy is the micro sim card from Straight Talk (we bought the At&T card) and off we went. My internet and MMS (pic messages) work great with no problems. The screen on the mega is awesome! Both of us get compliments all the time on our phones and people are amazed that both of them are on Straight Talk with no problems.,83,5
Samsung,"Hi! I'm in FL and i purchased this cell...so far I LOVE It!!! it's everything i wanted and more and have no complaints. It's smaller than the 6.3 --- which is so much better, as I am only 4""11 and have small hands. LOLMy ONLY caution is to purchasers who are buying this cell for usage in the United States - this cell (because it is Int'l) has TWO ports for the SIM card - which you have to purchase from your cell provider. That's not a problem, they're like $15 - $20. For my provider, the 2nd port is what works in the US. (that's at the lower end of the battery) But because you are using the 2nd port, you MAY have to bring your cell into your provider store for them to change the settings in your phone to recognize the 2nd port as the MAIN port.And that's it --- outside of that - this cell is AWESOME! I love it!",60,5
Samsung,"BOUGHT THE PHONE November 14, 2013Once you use it you may not want a Galaxy Note. Love the Dual SIM feature. Light and nice battery last long.UPDATE (01/08/2014)-Both SIM's work great. One has AT & T and other has STRAIGHT TALK (AT & T version).-Good internet speeds.-Awesome camera and shooting modes-I do not use a separate Tablet and Phone.... Both in one-Everyone's eyes popped out at the beauty I was carrying (In the US and Mexico)-Stuck-in a 32 GB micro-SD card and works great to expand memory-Android software has options to turn ON/OFF either or both the SIM's-Android software has options to choose which phone number(SIM) to be used for messaging or phone call..... cool feature-AT & T store guy's jaws dropped (like they saw an alien gadget) when he saw the awesome options of the phone and Android OS.-My purchase from seller was perfectly priced and shipping was the best...",55,5
Samsung,I up grade from the samsung note 2 to this phone I love it ....awesome phone. I am telling all of my friends about this phone.,11,5
Samsung,"This is the 5.8"" screen version of the Samsung Galaxy Mega. I ordered it as a gift as a person really liked my current Samsung Mega (6.3"" version) I was unaware there were actually 2 separate models; which translate to different screen size. I also ordered a case and quickly learned about the size difference not catching it while ordering the phone. I gave the person the opportunity to return it and get the 6.3"" version, however, they opted to keep it and really weren't too phased by the slightly smaller screen. They cited the fact their hands are a little smaller, hence, the smaller size is actually a better fit for them.This model also has 2 separate SIM card slots so you can use it with multiple providers without having to power it down to switch SIM cards. I'm not sure too many people will find this useful, however, I suppose there may be some cases where this is used. I used the phone with AT&T service and can say there were no problems whatsoever. I did have to manually setup the APN for the phone in order to get mobile data. I simply copied the APN settings from an existing AT&T phone and 4G popped right up. The phone is now in another part of the country and the user reports no problems with the device after a couple of months so I'm really happy with the purchase.",34,4
Samsung,"Right size for myself ,love it Galaxy Mega when you get it and you know it what I mean .",31,5
Samsung,"It you need an AMAZING smartphone, then you got it. I bought this phone, it's unlocked and yo can use it anywhere on this planet(with a micro sim). Not to talk much...Give it a TRY!!! It will blow up your mind.",28,5
Samsung,I bought this phone for my mom and she loves it. She can see the screen and its pretty user friendly. She also hasnt lost it yet. Great buy!,26,5
Samsung,"I was a skeptic at first. I've always liked to see what I'm buying, but I am more than happy with my samsung galaxy mega. I have had it for about a month now and have had no issues what so ever. I'm glad I chose this buyer",26,5
Samsung,"this phone is awesome! large screen, great resolution, terrific speakers!have no problems switching from bluetooth to wi-fi and back, switching gps function on or off - easy to navigate!and dual-sim capability - YES!it's NOT a note 2 or note 3 so you can't compare - each upgrade of phone will have its pluses and minusesmulti-language features abound, you should not have a problem using this phone internationally (but check first to make sure)if you want all of the above, works great for us in the U.S.!",23,5
Samsung,"Purchase the phone to use over seas. Love the apps that are preloaded. cons: Don't like the home screen with celsius deg. on it. Have not figured out how to change to Fahrenheit yet. Also I purchase Otter Box protector , Phone doesn't fit it correct ,can't use the power and volume switch. Phone is smaller that case.",21,5
Samsung,"This is really nice, its features are just like the Samsung tabs in the palm of my hand, calls are clear just like the pictures. Only problem i am having is it shots off quite often and reboost itself.",21,5
Samsung,"This is a good size smartphone (think about watching movie on it!). There is a good, comfortable weight on it that is just right when you hold it. It does not feel like a toy. This is a replacement for your tablet really, plus it is first and foremost a telephone. This has two places to mount your sim card as this is an unlocked international phone. If you are going overseas, you could have your US sim card so you could keep in touch while on US soil and have the other sim card for the place you are going to already in place and activated before you even leave. This phone's bands cover Europe, Asia, South America, etc. anywhere you go as long as you have the sim card for where you want to go. Other thoughts: A company based in Florida sells a sim card that does not expire and is truly international. It even include a US phone number.",14,4
Samsung,I have had this phone for almost 2 months and haven' had any issues. My wife has a white one from the same seller and both are good phones. They do the job and you can't beat the price. Battery life is excellent and way better than any phone I have had in the past. If you wanted the Galaxy note but don't want to pay the price this is the phone to get. Works flawless.......A++,18,5
Samsung,I love my phone. Size and all. It came with an american and european charger. I would recommend this phone to anyone. All my friends with samsung phones hare jealous of my amazing screen.,18,5
Samsung,"i without a dout love this phone..!!speed awesome, size amazing.functionability,still amazes me this is the definition of a smart phone...if your looking for a amazing phone,go samsung...had the note2 and someone stole it ,went for the big boy in the mega, andyes i do miss the stylus,but this phone just makes you giddy with all its capabilities.Apple eat your heat out...",18,5
Samsung,live in va switched my straight talk ph# & acct over to this big azz ph. just had to purchase sim card from straight talk. they walked me right through it. do not & i repeat i do not regret this upgrade from my straight talk lg dynamic. still learning the functions just wished a operations booklet came with it or it would of got a 5 star from me.,16,4
Samsung,"I've had this phone for about a week and I can honestly say that I'm not going back to my iPhone 4S anytime soon. I've experienced the Android platform since the Nexus One and I can say that's it gotten so much better. Some people think that Android is an iPhone/iOS knockoff, and to some respects it that may be true. However, the similarities stop with the Galaxy Nexus and Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).The phone is ""the right size"", I think. It's not to big or small. After doing a side by side comparison with the iPhone, the difference in screen size makes a difference. Colors are crisp and video seems to come alive on this screen. Video doesn't seem like an extravagant slideshow, like on some devices. The build quality is good. Some comments on the Internet seem to point out that the phone seems ""cheap"" or ""plasticy"". I disagree. The phone feels solid in the hand and is surprisingly light, especially when compared to the iPhone. I would still do my best to avoid dropping the phone, in which I got a case to protect it against a significant drop. The buttons and ports are similar to that of the Nexus S, in which the Power is on the right, volume rocker is on the Left, and the USB and headphone jack is on the bottom. Some people think the headphone jack should be at the top, similar to that of the Nexus One or iPhone, but I can see that Samsung placed the ports on the bottom for the accessories that may come, such as a Car or Desk Dock. I don't have either, but when I use a generic car holder, it's convenient to have the cords pointing down to stay out of the way.The real power of the phone is in it's software, Android 4.0 or ""Ice Cream Sandwich"". The phone feels responsive and smooth to the touch. I like how they changed the storage memory to become one single partition as opposed to two separate (On-board + USB storage). It makes for managing applications and memory more efficient, as ""moving to SD card"" was starting to become more trouble than it's worth. The interface is similar to that of Android 3.0 or Honeycomb, for those who are familiar.The real question I'm sure your all wondering is the ""build"" of the software. I can say that my Galaxy Nexus came with ""yakju"". Yes, I have the Google build of the software. However, I wasn't satisfied. With Google selling the Galaxy Nexus on the Google Play Store and having a different Android build ""takju"", I went and did some research. The good news is that the software is available from Google. Do a search for ""stock Android ROMs"". The bad news is that it required a little ""know how"" in computer programming to get the Google sanctioned takju on my Galaxy Nexus, but Voila!. I have the exact same Google branded phone that Google is selling with all the trimmings (such as Google Wallet), but in White!Very VERY good phone. Amazingly fast. Evermore faster on T-Mobile's HSPA network, getting up to 8MB download speeds on a good day. I don't know what else to say except that the Galaxy Nexus can quite possibly be the best phone for any phone fanatic out there. It sets the bar for other Android phones, as well as iPhone. Now let the competition begin!",21,5
Samsung,Love my phone and it looks like it is brand new.. It also came quicker than I expected. Will buy from this seller again ad recommend them to family and friends..,13,5
Samsung,"This clearly says in the title that it was a SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 for STRAIGHT TALK. Let me tell you now, if you buy this phone and are expecting for it to work on STRAIGHT TALK it wont..you will have just wasted $200 on a phone that is STRICTLY SPRINT. The ONLY TOWER STRAIGHT TALK DOES NOT, I REPEAT DOES NOT and will not work on STRAIGHT TALK. SO please dont waste your money unless you plan on being on contract woth sprint. This phone also does not and can not run off of sprints prepaid network.Anyome with a brain will see the flaws of this machine.",13,2
Samsung,"Plenty has been written about how awesome the Note 3 cellphone is, so Iƒ??m not going to waste time praising its specs/ features. Suffice to say it is exceptional. I have had the Note 3 since it was first released a few years back and have been very happy with it. I wanted a second one to replace my wifeƒ??s Galaxy S3 whose charging port recently stopped working, but where to go to buy another Note 3 without getting it from the cellular provider which would mean being obligated to another 2 year contact and an unwanted change to my cellphone plan? For me, going to Amazon was a no-brainer. The customer service and ease of doing business with Amazon has so far been excellent. That being said, I was still a bit reluctant to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Certified Refurbished phone. Until recently, I didn't know much about Magic Mobile Partners, but the fact that Amazon was backing them up via the Amazon fulfillment policy definitely eased my mind about buying a phone from them, so I pulled the trigger and ordered it,The phone was delivered quickly and came thoughtfully packaged. Magic Mobile Partners didnƒ??t disappoint. While the phone is described as a Certified Refurbished phone, the fact is that it came in pristine condition. Side note; had someone handed me the phone for the first time, I would have sworn it was brand new! The Note 3 came with all the required accessories associated with a cellphone purchase sans a user manual, but thatƒ??s no big deal because Magic Mobile Partners provided website information on where to get it if needed. I was able to get the phone activated with my cellular provider without a glitch. I am totally satisfied with my buying experience with both Magic Mobile Partners and Amazon. The next time I need to buy a cellphone, there will be no hesitation on where Iƒ??m going to get it.",133,5
Samsung,unlock phone. Is that a joke‹¬?,10,1
Samsung,"said to be unlocked, but this is completely blocked , I'm too unhappy with this, and I'm very good buyer of amazon , I 'm really upset",96,1
Samsung,"I was skeptical even after purchasing this phone from Amazon. After reading all the comments, I noticed that ALL THE REVIEWS FROM DIFFERENT SELLERS are piled up. I bought mine from BuySPRY so this seller's Samsung Galaxy Note III is the one I'm rating.I know that it is easy to find fake Note III phones, for this reason I carefully inspected mine as soon as I got it.The package is a no retail one as described.The phone comes with a removable protective sticker on the screen and main body adhered by the retailer.The screen and body come WITH NO SCRATCHES whatsoever, so I rate it with an A+.The battery was also inspected and it is original with a clean watermark.The stylus is very hard to get out, but I guess it is because the phone has 2+ years of manufacture date. I believe as the usage increases it will become easier to release.I placed a US T-Mobile sim card and turned on the phone.The screen is smooth, no sign of the screen being water damaged or broke and replaced.One thing I do notice is that the phone permanently displays a message in the notification bar that says: ""Sim Card is from and unknown source"" (To be honest that doesn't bother me at all).To enable the 4G speed data, you must MANUALLY type your carrier's APN and select the Network Mode as GSM/WDCMA/LTE.After this, I used the stylus and the click works perfectly fine, which means that it is OEM. (The fake ones do not even click).As far as the accessories, the phone comes with and OEM charger only. Mine was black. Thus, it is possible that if you buy the white Note III you will get a black charger.I will be constantly checking my phone and if any issues emerge, I will try to post them as soon as I can. (The seller gives a 90 DAY WARRANTY so that is definitely a plus).In order to know if you PHONE AND BATTERY are REAL OR FAKE I will leave two youtube links that I've found to be pretty helpful.[...][...]I hope this review helps you guys and good luck.",72,5
Samsung,"Very expensive, please provide refund for the excess amount taken",63,1
Samsung,Love the phone. Works great! Would give it 5 stars but didn't come with original box and no accessories as described,11,4
Samsung,"Bought this phone to run on Straight Talk. Phone arrived in practically new condition and works fantastically. My only complaint is that the description states that it comes with all original acessories, however it came with a generic charger rather than the original.",22,4
Samsung,This item is NOT unlocked for other carriers other than Verizon. Now I have spent more money to get it unlocked. Dont waste your time.,13,1
Samsung,This is a great alternative to unlocked phone if you are smart enough to follow instructions and change your APN. Phone was as good as new out of the box and should work with all GSM sim cards. It also has a global GSM option which should be good enough for it to be used outside US. Just follow the instructions ( send by the seller) and you should be up & running. I would definitely recommend buying it from BuySpry. I am glad I did and they were very helpful. I am using a H2O wireless sim card and they were precise in letting me know exactly what to do. Great alternative if you aren't willing to spend huge and yet get a high end flagship phone.,13,5
Samsung,the cell is not unlocked.,14,1
Samsung,"Great product!My SM-N900V (SM-N9005) came from DealFisher. It's in almost new condition. It has android 5.0, lollipop, already installed. Mine is white and came with a white charger & usb cord. I took my Consumer Cellular SIM card (AT&T network) and created a new APN after finding the settings needed online. It worked before I even called the IMEI number into Consumer Cellular.This is a Verizon model with GSM, so it can be used globally. It works fine on AT&T and T-Mobile GSM & HSPA+ networks (with their, or an MVNO's, SIM card It does not have the LTE 1700 band which AT&T and T-Mobile use for LTE, so you'll have to settle for HSPA+ speeds. Or switch to Verizon. I was going to switch anyway, but wanted GSM as an alternative.The support page with the manual is at - www dot samsung dot com/us/support/owners/product/SM-N900VZKEVZWYou can also download a USB driver for windows.Besides this model, there are versions of the Note 3 available for each provider on Amazon: AT&T/T-mobile, Sprint, and Verizon (w/o GSM) so you can order the one you need.",18,5
Samsung,I was a little worried at first because when it started up it was just verizon everything!!! I thought oh no its not unlocked and this will never work. I had just spent a couple hundred dollars so I had to try. I put my sim card (for straight talk) in and called to activate it and to my relief and surprise it worked! It went fast and smooth! I have had it for a few weeks and I love this phone. It was brand new looking and runs great. you will have to force stop some of the verizon programs but I know nothing about phone and it only took me 2 min so should be no problem for most.,18,5
Samsung,I feel tricked after getting the phone today. What I was told was not the same as when i got it. I am so disappointed. The charging area of the phone was broken and create problem with the charging in the future.,17,2
Samsung,The phone is very good and neat.,10,1
Samsung,"Awesome phone, just can not use it overseas. I am an American serving oversea in Africa. I purchased the phone from Amazon. I was so excited when it arrived. When I put my local SIM card, I received a SIM unlock code request. At first, I thought is would not be a problem. It has been two weeks and still cannot get the phone to work. I went to local Samsung service center and they were absolutely clueless. I called USA Samsung tech support, they said sorry, we can't help you, you have to see your carrier. I told them my phone does not have a carrier associated with it. I did go to several local carriers but that was fruitless. After further research on the intenet, I found out that the first SIM card you put in the phone has to be from the region you bought the phone. Really? I did not see that anywhere in manuals. So Samsung, what should I do? Hop on a plane from western Africa go to the United States to unlock my phone, and that's not even guaranteed because I have already put a foreign carrier SIM card in the phone which makes it even harder to unlock the phone. Samsung is the only company doing this, all because they want to make more money. Samsung, you're telling me you're not making enough money?For what it worth, I am returning the phone for a refund. I will be ordering another brand since the market is full of new phones. I have advised others at the American Embassy of this issue so they don't make the same mistake. I found out today that the word is getting around at other embassies in the area are they are aware of this issue. I received several emails today from them thanking me for forewarning them.Good Job Samsung! What is going to be your next trick?",10,2
Samsung,"Its a lovely phone, phablet whatever you want to call it. It could be premium build for its coast but there may be reason for that. Compare to the competition, it let them behind. the new release iPhone 5s don't even shake me. Small screen, the same design from last year. to be honest i don't see why people make them self a fool by getting crazy for it. The new Lg is a good phone but where is the battery removal, same for HT C one, with a 4.7 screen. THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 3 is not perfect like any else but it balance size software and usability, that make it a hot cake phone for whom who really want some thing you can use for almost everything on the go.This phone has a outstanding battery life. I got the since Saturday, Oct 5 I charged just one as I am typing this Tuesday, October 8. it still 35%. I did lot on it.",10,5
Samsung,i just returned the phone. the model is N900 not N9000 as advertized and it has a sticker that says its locked for American sim cards only. this is a ripoff. seller is doing false advertising. i wouldnt buy from them. i tried buying unlcked blackberry phones from them before same thing happened. dont buy from this seller. Amazon should remove them.,50,1
Samsung,"First off, it's important to note that I migrated from an iPhone 5, I have been an iPhone user for 3 years (had the 4, 4S and 5) and a mac user for 5 years, I also have an iPad, therefore it's safe to assume that I have heavily invested in Apple's ecosystem. In ways I do miss my iPhone (I still have it, haven't let it go just yet), but in other ways I don't. More on that later.REGIONAL LOCK:But before I talk about my post-iOS experience, I'd like to make one thing clear about the regional lock. I have researched this issue extensively before buying my Note 3 as I travel around a lot and need to use different SIM cards, so I directly contacted different sellers on amazon to make sure the phone is truly unlocked, and i ended up buying it from ""Mercate Group"" after confirming with them that the phone doesn't have a regional lock. I tried a US AT&T sim card and an Egyptian sim card and they're both working fine. I always prefer to buy from sellers that are fulfilled by Amazon (if the product isn't offered by amazon themselves), because if there are any issues, you're just one amazon CS phone call away from solving the problem. Amazon have an exceptional customer service. So conclusion: most phones come with a regional lock now but apparently Samsung realized that it will backfire on their behinds. Solution: contact the seller before you buy the phone.WHY I MIGRATED FROM iPHONE, WHAT I MISS, WHAT I DON'T:Well, as I mentioned earlier, I've heavily invested in Apple's ecosystem and I have to admit that their ecosystem is simply amazing, the seamless integration between your mac, iPad and iPhone, iCloud, restoring backups is an easy process, etc.. Then I really started getting bored of iOS and its lack of customizability, also the iPhone's small screen, especially when I first saw the Note 3 and put my iPhone next to it; the note basically dwarfed the iPhone. I do a lot of reading on my phone and the bigger screen does all the difference. Now you're thinking ""but what about one-handed operation?"", well I have fairly big hands so it doesn't bother me as much, I can still text while driving (let's face it, we all do it) and samsung has an item in their settings called ""one handed operation"" just for that. But if you're a person with small hands and plan on using it one handed, that will be impossible.WHAT I MISS IN MY iPHONE-iMessage, FaceTime, iCloud and most of all: iTunes.I didn't truly appreciate iTunes until I had to use Samsung Kies (Samsung's equivalent for iTunes). Think of the Kies as a punishment rather than a software solution. It's Samsung's way of punishing you for all the sins they assume you've done. It's painful to use and it's the biggest reason why I miss my iPhone. I have all my music on iTunes and it's such a shame that I have to use drag and drop to transfer music to my Note 3 like it's 2002 or something.-Music and photo viewing: iOS' music interface is like no other, it's the best in the business and no one will ever take away that from them. End of. iOS 7 has a great timeline when it comes to the gallery too.WHAT I DON'T MISS IN MY IPHONE-The screen: albeit slightly oversaturated, the Note 3's screen is simply unparalleled, I can do a lot of reading and not feel eye strain-The battery: the note 3's battery is slightly better (it's a bigger battery but it's an octa core phone with a mammoth screen)-The lack of customizability: this is android's strongest point and there are endless widgets and ways in which you can make the phone suit your needs-Restricted sharing: let's say you wanna send a photo using whatsapp; in iOS, you need to do it through whatsapp whereas in android you can do it directly from gallery. Yes, in iOS you can share a photo directly from gallery but only by mail or iMessage or AirDrop aka the ways Apple WANT you to use, because they want to trap you in their ecosystem.I will not go into details when it comes to the note 3 itself, many other reviews covered that extensively. But in all, the phone is smooth, has a beautiful screen, camera is good although the iPhone's camera is faster, S-pen is useful but you won't use it as much as you think. Has nice features you probably won't need (air gestures, smart scroll, etc..) they're nice to have but meh.I've only had the phone for 2 weeks so I'm still yet to decide if I'll completely let go of my iPhone or not.",11,4
Samsung,"This phone is awesome! The Note 3 puts my iPhone to shame. It is SUPER fast - I have never before had a phone that was this fast. The screen is crystal clear, it sounds great and it does soooooo many things! I've had it just about a week and I'm still discovering all the things this phone is capable of doing. I absolutely love it. I don't travel overseas so the regional locking is not an issue for me. It works fine here in the U.S. I love that I can use my sim card from Straight Talk (with service from AT&T towers) and receive unlimited everything for $45/month. What's not to love? This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time. If you're on the fence about this phone, GET IT! You won't be sorry.",11,5
Samsung,"I got my black Note 3 N900 model from Wireless Everything (provided A+ service and fast free shipping). Previously had gotten the N9005 model from AT&T and it was a bad experiance...the phone was full of bloatware and AT&T through in the kitchen sink to slow it down to the point where it was almost unresponsive at times (glad i returned that sucker while i was still in my 14 day return period). So then I decided on getting the N900 model unlocked with less bloatware and let me tell you, its so much faster! Believe it or not, the N9005 Snapdragon 800 version does not respond as fast as this N900 Octacore version. I even noticed my unlocked N900 went through 3 series of updates while the N9005 from AT&T and T-mobile have no updates. I think the unlocked versions get updates sooner and guaranteed. While the operators slow/block/and limit updates. I remember a lot of lag with the carrier version of the N9005...touchwiz even crashed on me one time saying ""Touchwiz has stopped working"" and had to restart the phone. Battery life is also longer on this N900 version. I can live with out 4k video...1080p video and 13 megapixel stills that are as good as some point and shoot cameras will do just fine. Lastly, while its true that the N900 model does not have LTE, 3G speeds and HSPA+ are sufficient any Youtube, Pandora etc. You can't even get the LTE version that works in the U.S. unlocked on Amazon (only the carriers have those)...the other LTE version on Amazon will only work on LTE frequencies in Europe, which are different from those in the U.S. of A. So in short, if you want a good clean unlocked Note 3 that will work in the U.S. without any ""Regional SIM lock"" issues, get the N900 version. I popped in my Lycamobile SIM card in and it worked right away...$29 Unlimited Talk, Text, and Data with Lycamobile.com (no contracts and transfer your number too).",12,5
Samsung,I just get the phone. It seems there are two layers of seal. The inner one is broken. The outer one is obviously glued afterwards. Just worry if this phone is really new or just faked? (see the pictures I uploaded),24,1
Samsung,"Dont buy this phone if you are actually looking for the real Samsung Note 3 Donƒ??t be fooled by reading international version, it has inferior CPU compared to Note 3 US version!!!, and doesnƒ??t support 4G!! ƒ?? I agree that this phone is sold in other countries, but what is the point in spending in so much money when you canƒ??t enjoy the latest speed and higher processing power . 1.3 GHZ is so much less CPU compared 2.3 quad core CPU the US versioncarrier version have (Even the note 1 , 3 year old phone has 1.4 GHZ) . This is an attempt to rip off people who are not well aware of what they are getting !!",24,1
Samsung,"This is not an unlocked phone. As soon as I insert my SIM card, it is asking for a SIM unlock code. I am extremely unhappy with DBroth and Amazon.",13,1
Samsung,"Most of the initial pages on the phone are filled with great big Samsung apps that we don't really want and don't really need. The page to the left of the home screen starts off with a 3-line deep full screen-width app that counts your steps. I don't know why a step-counting app needs to take up almost a full page, but it does. There are all sorts of apps that are integrated in which duplicate or even triplicate each other's functions and it's impossible to get rid of the ones you don't want or aren't using. Samsung even has this duplicate app store because it can't be bothered to put its regular apps in the regular Android store, so you have to manage two app stores with the other apps you bought on whatever Android phone you had before this one. Evernote and that Flip program both keep updating and will keep notifying you that you need more updates, even if you try to shut them off. There's a messaging app that, if you get AT&T, will be tied into your phone number and, even if you use Google Voice, will duplicate all your text messages, so you'll get double dings whenever you get a text message.If you press the home button too long or it thinks you double pressed it, you get this MyMagazine app popup and it's impossible to turn that off or stop it from happening (and again with the apps which duplicate or triplicate each others functions, there are several other social/news-aggregating apps on the phone that you can't get rid of).. The stylus is great, but you can't change the apps that open in Pen Window. So, even though Evernote and Samsung have announced a ""deeper partnership"", you have to take extra steps to open Evernote instead of the memo app in the pen window, which I tried to do for the first week before I gave up and tried to shut that app off. Its the same with most of the air command functions, there's just no way to really customize it and actually make it useful instead of going with the apps that Samsung *thinks* we all want.About a month after I received the phone, it stopped working. My warranty company, SquareTrade, didn't want to repair it because they said it was supposed to be under warranty from Samsung. Samsung USA doesn't recognize the IMEI number. They transferred me to Samsung Canada who didn't recognize the IMEI. HeavyDuty Electronics is apparently not an authorized retailer. Because the phone is from Vietnam, I went to the Samsung Vietnam website at [...]number on the phone either. After a few months, I finally got SquareTrade to repair it. When I received it back, they'd reset everything and it worked, but only for about a month again. I don't know if it's the region locking that Samsung put into this supposedly unlocked phone or what, but the phone apparently just bricks itself after about a month of use.Both times, I tried putting a new battery in and the phone wouldn't start. Both times the new battery was working in another Note 3 before I tried the battery swap and both times the new battery still worked in another Note 3 afterward, but wouldn't work in this one, so it's not a battery issue. Multiple chargers plugged in won't keep it charged, so it's not a charger issue. And last time SquareTrade just reset it and sent back the same phone/battery, so it seems to be an internal trigger that won't let it charge and keeps it quiescent.I think the seller stole these phones, which is why no Samsung subsidiary seems to have a record of the IMEI, and why the phone apparently bricks itself after about a month of use.",17,1
Samsung,"I was originally very happy with the purchase... it arrived quickly, the phone appeared to be in great shape... I took it to t-mobile right when it arrived and everything checked out fine. About two weeks into using the phone I tried to add an SD card and realized the phone could not detect the SD card. I tried different SD cards and none of them worked, even though the SD cards worked fine on other devices. About 30 days after I get the phone, t-mobile disconnects my service. I call t-mobile and ask them why I don't have service and they tell me that the phone still has a balance from a previous owner. So I filed a request for a refund and they did provide a full refund, but to ship the phone back I had to pay for the shipping and insurance. So what started as a ""good purchase"" turned out to be a bad purchase, costing me the moneys for the return, about one week without cell phone service and the disappointment and reminder that if a deal is too good to be true, it probably is. At least I managed to get my money back from the purchase.",69,1
Samsung,"BE AWARE, DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS INDIVIDUAL, TRIED SELLING ME A DEFECTIVE NOTE 3 UNDER THE IMPRESSION IT WAS LIKE NEW..!! HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME IT WAS LIKE NEW, IM PUTTING UP PICTURES AS WELL. SHYSTIE INDIVIDUAL... DONT TRUST..!!!!! THIS DEVICE IT TWISTED..!!!",45,1
Samsung,"This about the 3rd time buying a note 3 from these guys and noticing that either it takes a long time to ship or that the phone is not fully paid of from the original seller. Im writing this as a recommendation to stay cautious on what you buy and no to endure all the headaches of this phone. However, this phone is beautiful and worth it just wish it was much easier to buy.",39,3
Samsung,Please be advised that this guy and/or company will communicate with you BEFORE the sale...NO PROBLEM... but as soon as you purchase they do not honor their word... Never ship the Device... Will not respond to your inquiries... Simply put... just a POS! Thank goodness for a good Credit Card Company that quickly and easily reversed all charges...Even better... Thanks to this... I actually found similar product for $60 cheaper and I have it in hand 3 days later... I guess things do happen for a reason.. THANKS BUDDY!BTW... How do you give ZERO star rating?,13,1
Samsung,"Upgraded from an Galaxy S2. Screen has alot of real estate. Very fast, some very cool features even though you wont use all of them. S-pen is great for people on the run and need to keep quick notes or can be used as note pad as well. When using transcribe I dont have best handwriting and interpret s my text well. Would recommend. Not apple bashing but does stuff an iphone cant.",12,5
Samsung,Good value compared to Note 4 that I seriously considered buying.,13,5
Samsung,"Great phone. Exactly what I needed for work and leisure. (Not too big. Not too small and has a stylus) It was unlocked, so I was able to use a sim card from a network provider in a different country. Just ensure the network frequency matches that of the phone.",20,5
Samsung,"Wow what can i say. I got this phone to replace my Galaxy 3. When it arrived i could not believe my eyes. The phone looked better than bran new, not a scratch or neck anywhere. Activated the phone on 05/15/15, after 10 to 15 minutes of uses the phone would go blank or black,and the screen would freeze. Tried every thing to fix. Look good, Bad phone",18,2
Samsung,Great phone! Super fast. Great color. Son loves this phone. Great price for a non contract phone compared to what they charge at the phone stores. Was advised to get new SD card for every new phone for if to run at its best. So runs perfect.,15,5
Samsung,"Perfectly described! The only thing wrong with it, was there was a couple dings on the corner of the phone. Works perfectly fine and used it with the Straight Talk Bring your own phone package. Exactly what I wanted. It even came in before the delivery date! Thank you!!!",17,5
Samsung,"The phone does not quite meet the specs of a real Note III but the price is about 1/2. You do get your money's worth as the phone up to this point works great. The 8MP camera pictures are very good as is the display. When buy a protective case or a screen protector do not purchase any of the ones for the Notes III as the ""Neo"" Note III is just a little smaller. The difference is hard to notice until you try and make one of the Note III accessories I mention previously to fit right. The power/data connector for the Neo is mini USB 2 or 3 and not the lighting type cable that the Note III uses. Those plus the camera are the big differences I have noticed so far but still for $350.00 I don't feel ripped off even though the price of a GD phone is just stupid anyway. I would definitely recommend purchasing this phone if you really want a Note III but can't or won't pay $600.00 to $700.00 dollars to own one. I know it is cheaper with a contract but I wanted the month to month so now I own the phone and can leave anytime. I would appreciate knowing where the items I talked about could be obtained for this phone especially the screen protector, if anyone knows. Thanks in advance.",39,5
Samsung,"First, the description says N910A (AT&T version) but actually what shipped was the N910T (T-Mobile version). That being said, I'm using it on AT&T so the bands are 100% compliant with AT&T's network (I get full LTE speeds), and the upside is that the N910T ships with an unlocked bootloader (for those interested in rooting and that sort of thing). I'm quite pleased with my mistake, because after some research the N910T is definitely the phone I should have been looking for.I cannot speak highly enough of the condition of the phone. I'm picky and I cannot tell it has ever been used. I feel like either the screen was protected by a screen protector or was entirely replaced; either way I cannot distinguish it from a new phone. There is not a scratch, smudge, or crack to be found.The product shipped in a non-OEM box with an OEM charger/USB cord and white Apple-looking headphones. I'm not sure if normally more tips are included for the S-Pen, but I only got the tip that came in the pen. All accessories also appeared brand new wrapped in plastic.I see some complaints of bloatware, which are valid (T-Mobile bloatware in my case) but it doesn't take much to go through and disable those apps. SD card support means I'm not worried about storage space; I have a 64GB card and most of my storage-hogging apps (i.e. Kindle and Zinio) are able to be moved to the SD card.Update: This phone is still awesome. I recommend getting a Samsung MicroSD card if you find yourself interested in the expandable storage, as I initially used a SanDisk and had lots of issues with the card unmounting and apps moved to the SD not working. I read up on some android forums and saw some people had issues with non-Samsung cards (don't ask why). I switched to?ÿSamsung 64GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDXC Card with Adapter up to 48/MB/s (MB-MP64DA/AM)?ÿand have not had a single issue in about 4-5 months of use.",61,5
Samsung,"The phone is great however it will not work well on Metro PCS service. I contacted Metro several times as I was not getting great coverage and they tried to network reset the device. Unfortunately, it did not help.",11,2
Samsung,"This seems to be an AT&T phone filled with bloatware. wont let me setup my phone n sim. sim works in other phones and i can access my contacts from the sim. The box it came in was really dirty... and the buttons and screen was not responsive much. Infact the phone lagged often just navigating menus. I paid for a unlocked phone. not a AT&T phone. Also the phone froze with a at&t symbol first startup. That pretty much made me livid.So buyer beware. I wanted this phone for its color.EVERYother unlocked phone i have ever bought ever was just put in the sim setup n go.this. Nope.. At&T all the way. so im pretty much mad. If they had mentioned that i would not have bought this. Do they want me to study how to jailbreak my unlocked phone to be clear of at&t bloatware?I'm really dissapointed also.in how laggy it was. makes me wonder if this is even a note 4...it even has a AT&T startup.im sending this back. the box was dingy no stickers no real manual inside. there is a AT&T quickstart guide inside though! i didnt purchase a AT&T samsung note. if i wanted that i woulda bought it from AT&T.i wont buy a refurbished phone from Amazon again. This was a really bad experience. The total cost was 540, i just thought itd look like the picture also. didnt even. picture looks slightly metalic. its just dingy plain white. looks like cheap plastic. at that price which is the same as other notes.. i really bought this for the looks of the picture. WHICH DID NOT DELIVER...so many problems. I dont think i ever been this dissapointed in something i bought from amazon before. I spent lot of money for this",30,1
Samsung,"Perfect ""UNLOCKED"" note 4!! Works great with Straight Talk :)",29,5
Samsung,"Very impressed with the condition of this phone. Looks practically new. T-Mobile bloat ware loaded vs AT&T...but as soon as I booted up with my simple card, automatically update to the newest version of lollipop. Couldn't do that with the unlocked AT&T Note 3 that I passed on to my spouse. Will be back.",16,5
Samsung,"What is confusing about buying one of these unlocked phones from Amazon is that they have so many different model numbers. Some are meant for Europe, others are meant for different carriers in the U.S. You really need to research. I myself have a Straight Talk plan, and am coming from a Nexus 4 phone.Because this model is SM-910A, that means it's specially meant to be sold by AT&T. What this means is that it comes pre-loaded with AT&Ts special apps that take up memory, and without some others, because AT&T replaced them with their own, less useful version. For example, they replaced the Galaxy Note app ""Car Mode"" with their own AT&T ""Drive Mode"". Drive Mode is far less useful than Car Mode; it turns on at the wrong times or on its own, auto replies to texts with a preachy message about not texting and driving, and signs off with a hash tag, which I find obnoxious.You also receive AT&T software updates, and it wants to connect me to the AT&T contacts account every time I open my Contacts, even though I don't have an account, because I am not a customer. The only way I can get rid of these is to root my phone, which voids the warranty.So, buyer beware! If you are not an AT&T customer, you will have to deal with useless bloat ware. Also be warned that an AT&T phone needs an AT&T phone case, because the microphone at the bottom of the phone is in a different place than, say, a Verizon Galaxy Note 4.I enjoy this phone a lot, love the stylus, enjoy the TouchWiz features, so I am going to return this one and buy a Note 4 from a company that can assure me it's not attached to any one phone carrier.",114,3
Samsung,"After doing a lot of research looking for an unlocked phone because I didn't want to be locked into a contract for 2 years, this was a great deal for a high end phablet and arrived as promised.

Samsung,"I love this phone. It is fast and powerful. The camera is great. The stylus is fantastic. The fingerprint reader is a big step up from a passcode, but still needs to be improved. The screen is gorgeous!Android versus iOSBottom line, geeks should choose Android. Fashion trendy people should choose Apple. Frugal minded people should choose Android. People who simply find it difficult to do more than the basics on a smart phone are probably better off with Apple if you don't mind paying more money. If you are not sure where you fit, read on. If you aren't sure if you like Android of iPhone, read this paragraph. Otherwise skip on down to the next paragraph. I like Android and iOS. I am also frustrated by both. I use both. I like begin able to add lots of storage on the cheap via micro SD, thanks to Samsung Android phones. I like being able to carry a spare battery, again thanks to Samsung. Android has so many more features! On the other hand, iPhone just works. iOS is very easy to use, mostly because it doesn't have the number of options available in Android. My wife uses iPhone, because she is not a geek and doesn't need more than the iPhone offers, with the exception of more storage space - come on Apple! Stop raking us over the coals for storage! For that, you really, really suck. But, I also love Apple. I don't have to rescue my wife from some disaster. Oh, and Apple, where is my swipe keyboard. Let's enter this decade, shall we? It is pretty easy to download spyware or other malware from the Google Play store. So, if you are not very careful about your apps and safety, Apple is still the safer choice.The StylusWhen you remove it from the phone (it stores inboard), a hanndy menu pops up. When you remove the pen and walk away, the phone chimes to reduce the chance that you'll lose the stylus. The stylus is pressure sensitive. It is extremely accurate compared to your finger. It is pretty accurate compared to other stylus devices. Samsung uses Wacom, the art industry standard for digitial stylus art. To be honest, the N-trig stylus on my Microsoft Surface Book blows Wacom out of the water! (I wish I could get an N-trig pen with barrel roll and angel detection for my Surface Book, but that is out of scope of this discussion). Yes, you can take a note even when the screen is locked. As an aside, I use the stylus with with OneNote all the time. OneNote syncs my notes and photos to the cloud (OneDrive) and my computer automatically. Samsung includes Adobe SketchBook Pro (not just the lite version), Which is surprisingly pleasant to use for sketches even on a 5.7 inch screen. I am an amateur artist. I work in both traditional and digital media. I was very surprised that I could produce reasonable art on my phone. No, it isn't my first choice, but it is reasonable. I have not yet tried Apple's Pencil, so I cannot compare the two.Fingerprint ReaderThe fingerprint reader is okay but a far cry from the reader on the iPhone. Here are my few complaints. I have to swipe instead of touch, which is a surprisingly big difference. Swiping works flawlessly only 25% of the time when I'm distracted. If you don't swipe your entire finger pad, forget it. The fingerprint scanner should have a nice concave seat for eyes free swiping. On my iPhone, a scan unlocks and opens the phone. On the Samsung Note, it unlocks but does not always open the phone. Here is what I mean. If the phone is locked, swiping unlocks the phone and takes me to the home screen (or whatever screen was last active). If the phone was unlocked but on the lock screen, swiping the reader does nothing. Instead, you have to swipe the touchscreen. I can't tell you how annoying this is. Don't make we switch between options to open the phone!!!!!!!ScreenThe 5.7"", Quad HD (2560x1440) AMOLED screen if gorgeous. In my opinion, it easily outshines the Apple 6 screen,which is 5.5"" with 1080p resolution. I can't see the pixels on either, which suggests Samsung went overboard on pixel density. But, Samsung's AMOLED screen provides a noticeably superior image. The colors are rich and full, almost liquidy.The CameraGreat photos and video! The camera offers 16 MP, so you can crop away and still have great images with lots of detail, even on your monster TV. Compare this to the Note 5 at 16 MP, the Note 3 at 13 MP and the iPhone 6 at 8 MP. Want 1080p (2.1 MP) video at 60 frames per second? No problem. Want full 4K (3840x2160 or 8.4 MP) video, you can do that too. The iPhone 6 supports up to 1080p. Regrettably, Samsung artificially limits 4K video recording to 5 minutes. It seems they are worried that users will quickly eat up their storage space. This isn't an issue if you add a 128 GB micro SD card like me, but Samsung doesn't seem to acknowledge that. Oh well. I guess I can settle for WQHD (2560x1440) resolution. The native Samsung camera software has lots of features and shooting modes, and you can download more modes free. Try the rear-camera selfie, wide angle selfie, burst shot, spherical panorama, virtual tour, fast motion, sequence shot, slow motion and more.Multi-windowYes, you can finally run two apps side-by-side. It is just awesome! Unfortunately, not all apps support this function. This is a super handy feature. Of course, now I'm spoiled, and I get mad at developers that don't support the feature. No, Apple does not offer this feature.Health and FitnessThere's a sensor on the back for checking pulse and O2 levels. You can also use the sensor as a virtual button in some apps. S-Health is Samsung's feature rich application. Yes, it is superior to Apple's offering.A tangent on megapixels (MP)The photos are truly gorgeous with an outrageous 16 MP. What does 16 MP really mean. A person with perfect vision can't see individual pixels of a 50 inch, 1080P (2.4 MP) display from 10 feet away. I person with perfect vision can't see individual pixels on a 144"" (12 ft.), 4k (8.4 MP) display from the same distance. Really, who needs more than 8 pixels? It will only make a difference when you start cropping and blowing up your photos. To learn more about pixel density on a big screen, see http://www.techradar.com/us/news/television/ultra-hd-everything-you-need-to-know-about-4k-tv-1048954.The Note 4 continues to support replaceable battery and micro SD cards via removable back. The Note 5 does not have a removable back, how annoying. This is a prime reason I chose the Note 4 over the Note 5.The phone has a bunch of other features like NFC, Wi-Fi Direct screen mirroring (to your TV), various Samsung applications, smart cover (optional), OTG, MHL3, GPS, Bluetooth 4.1, ANT+, 2.7GHz quad core, IR remote (use your phone as a remote control for your entertainment system), micro SD slot up to 128 GB, and S-Voice (an inferior alternative to Google Now).I can really play full 1080p movies from my phone to my big screen TV with no lag or chopping.The only thing I could think to add would be secure facial or retina recognition.",23,5
Samsung,"Not sure what to say but this was my 1st unlocked phone. I dont know why the At&t branded unlocked phone is $200+ cheaper than the locked phone seeing that unlocked phones are normally higher valued for their ""unlockness"".Regardless, from the gate I had concerns about the phone. Shortly after starting up the phone for the 1st time, it had problems reading the At&t sim card, after which I had the At&t rep give me a new phone because my current Sim was too small for this phone. After the 3rd reboot, the Sim started to read that it was an active phone.From here I was plagued with constant system reboots, 1 per day, sometimes even twice in 1 day. They would happen at random times and most of the time it was when the phone was just sitting there. Then I kept getting system security error msgs stating ""Unauthorized actions have been detected. Restart your phone to undo any unauthorized changes. At NO point did I attempt to ""root"" or modify this phone's function. I merely installed my apps fom the play store to this phone. After the 1st two days of this, I was hoping that a factory wipe would solve these issues. After the wipe I even made a point not to install anything outside of its default apps. I just added my gmail account so I can check my mail and view my contacts. Hours after the wipe, the phone rebooted and sometime that evening I got the ""Unauthorized"" message again.perhaps I got a bad egg or perhaps I ordered from a bad company. Regardless, I am returning the phone back and looking for either locked At&t phones or the Factory unlocked International GSM version of this phone.",21,1
Samsung,"I was a little worried about buying a high price ""open box"" phone (unlocked). But the phone arrived in perfect condition, no signs of use. I checked the IMEI at my carrier and they confirmed it is clean. All original accessories were present in the box. It gets LTE on my TMobile sim. Bought it from S+D Accessories, seller answered all questions quickly. I will definitely recommend buying an unlocked Note 4. It is a powerful beast and I haven't experienced any TouchWiz lag yet. Display is extremely gorgeous. Overall a beautiful piece of art and some brilliant engineering by Samsung!",71,5
Samsung,"MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THE CORRECT VERSION FOR YOUR REGION. I was all set to order the wrong version when I realized the only difference is the letter at the end of the model number. I believe N910 means the Note 4, but the 'a' at the end of the N910a is the only way to know this is the version for North America. With that said...I love this phone! In fact I love it so much I bought one for my mother as well. I like that it has a bigger screen, without being huge. I use the auto screen brightness and built in 'Power saving' mode and don't have any issues with battery life. Also available is a 'Ultra power saving mode' for when you inevitably leave town without a charger. By turning off all the extra little features, switching from color to grayscale, and only running the few applications that you tell it to (like phone and messages) it greatly extends the battery life. For example I just switched my phone with a current charge of 59% and it has an 'Estimated max. standby time' of 10.6 Days. I've not had the need to test this out completely as it will charge from a common microUSB charger, but I have used it on a return trip home when I realized I had <15% power remaining. The ability to still send and receive calls and texts and still have more than a day of remaining standby time when I got home was amazing.",57,5
Samsung,"They delivered the package one day ahead. That''s something good. However, what''s bad is the screen resolution and the 16MP camera and other specifications indicated for camera and screen is not true. I am a user of Samsung for years and my family so I know very much the resolution of Samsung Note 4. I also own a samsung note 3 before but the resolution and camera of this phone is even worst than my note 3. It is disappointing.Everything looks okay but this issue is very bad. Obviously something has been manipulated with the screen it has a little scratch on the rear camera and the screen has a little bit of traces on the edges that it has been opened. I bought this phone because of the high rating of this seller. I If they will replace my phone with no issues like this. I will give them a very high rating for providing good customer satisfaction.",13,1
Samsung,I researched the heck out of this to make sure I was the one I wanted for Cricket. Really loving it. This model (N910 'A') is specifically for AT&T. Since they own Cricket it easily changed with just a sim card. I specifically bought the '4' because you can remove the battery when you dont feel like being tracked by the NSA for a few hours. Charges super fast with the samsung charger. Pen works great. Something about being able to draw pics and take notes by hand that I really like.,18,5
Samsung,"A nice upgrade compared to previous models. It feels made of premium materials, nice touch with the metal band and slick glass screen. Screen protector isn't necessary with this device.I got this phone to finally get LTE with my service. I've always used international phones mainly because I travel often and I also prefer my phones to be vanila from the manufacture. No carrier branding, tweaks/restrictions or bloatware.And yes this phone works 100% with T-Mobile LTE, at first it didn't, I thought I ended up with the wrong phone after reading countless answered questions and forums about the N910C. It turned out I had wrong APN settings and I needed to update my SIM card to a newer one that supports LTE.",10,5
Samsung,"I bought this so it would work when I am in Argentina as well as here in the US. It was specifically designed by Samsung for South and Central America, but the 4G LTE bands also cover what AT&T offers: 4G HSPA and HSPA+: 850 MHz (Band 5), 1900 MHz (Band 2); LTE: 700 MHz: (Band 17), 850 MHz (Band 5), 1900 MHz (Band 2), 1700/2100 MHz (Band 4) depending on the area you are in and the licenses owned in that area. This phone should work on T-mobile, according to what others have said online (the other GSM network), but right now T-mobile does not use all the same band signals that this phone does (T-mobile is stated to use Band 12, not covered by N910C). I had Cricket on my old Samsung, and since AT&T bought it, I stayed with them since they offered be 20 GB per month with talk and text (I think that offer is now expired). Cricket always worked fine in the past where I live, so I'll stay with this plan for a while (AT&T would charge much more for 20 GB). Cricket used to be a CDMA network but is now GSM (AT&T bought them, but decided to keep the companies separate). It took me a bit of time to find this all out so I'm posting it here in case it helps answer others' questions.",52,5
Samsung,The box has been opened and the paint around the charging area has been peeled off so,49,1
Samsung,AWESOME! Had to get a sim from MetroPCS for 29 bucks works great!!!!,11,5
Samsung,"The display of the phone was defective; purple color covered its left side. In addition, the SIM was VERY difficult to insert / pull. Bottom line; I had to return the product immediately and ask for a refund.I have ordered (from another store) the standard Note 4 (no LTE) and it was the opposite experience. Everything worked smoothly.By the way, the package of the defective phone was somehow strange, as the sticker did not seem to be completely sealed, as it should be, and there was only one sticker at one side, unlike the standard, where it is sealed at both sides of the box and you really need to make an effort to tear it.",41,1
Samsung,"I was surprised to see that phone (an international version ) had been opened and some stickers have been broken.It was not listed as a pre-opened phone! Despite having been pre-opened.I have tried using the phone and the battery already seems weak, it runs out quickly (within a day) of regular usage.I reached out and I see that there is a 20% restocking fee?",34,2
Samsung,"Some said it would never catch on, but here we are four years on from the original Galaxy Note phablet with the fourth generation device - the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.The Galaxy Note's big screen and S Pen stylus are certainly not for everyone. The Samsung Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Alpha offer a more mainstream smartphone setup - the Note 4 brings together big power, a big screen and big productivity.",12,5
Samsung,"Not really what I expected. This model seems to have issues connectin to the TMobile data network. Never would it give me 4G LTE, OCCASIONALLY would I get a 3G connection.Ontop of it all I had to deal with a factory Hungarian configuration, so if you do not speak Hungarian, you will have some hard time around.Good Luck!",12,2
Samsung,Received package today. Noticed the seals on the cell phone box were broken. Opened the box and there wasn't a phone in it. Extremely disappointed! Now I have to go through the refund process probably a minimum of 10 days!,12,1
Samsung,"There are plenty of reviews about the phone itself, so outside of noting that the wife is very happy with her Note 4, I'm going to comment on the vendor we chose, NGP_USA_STORE.The phone did not ship from Washington, it came from Kowloon. That's no big deal, because I love Kowloon, and the phone was shipped via Fedex Air, so we received it within five days.The vendor states that the phone is new in the original box, and it certainly was. One end seal was slit open, but the other seal was intact, thereby acting like a hinge for the box. The packing film was still intact on the front and back of the phone, and there was no sign that the accessories had been removed, including the battery, which was still in its sealed bag. The phone box was very well protected in bubble wrap, and since the 910C is nominally intended for Europe, a USA adapter for the AC charger was included in the shipping box. If you have a externally powered USB hub, you really don't need the Samsung charger to charge the phone. For all intents and purposes, this phone was new in box, in perfect condition, and completely unlocked. After a quick charge, insertion of the XDSC, and transfer of the micro SIM card from her S3, the phone came to life, was recognized by the carrier, and was thus ready for service. It was almost like buying a phone in Singapore, where we purchased her old S3, and phones must be unlocked by law.We ordered the 910C because our research indicated that this phone contains the 4G bands necessary in the US for either AT&T or T Mobile. We don't have a data plan with our current carrier, Pure Talk, but thought that we should have a fully capable phone should we ever find it practical to switch. We rely on our 60mb wifi at home or free wifi at the airport for data, keeping in mind that most of the free public wifi is generally anemic; maybe that will improve with time. In the meantime, data performance of this phone using our robust home wifi is outstanding.So, not only is the wife very happy with the Samsung Note 4, we can heartily endorse this particular vendor, NGP_USA_STORE.",22,5
Samsung,"This is the worst product ive bought from amazon to date. Imports from UAE seem to full of flaws as quality control isn't implemented at any point in the process. Thus, UAE imports are the worst copycat products made on the planet and we consumers are screwed out of our money. I actually believe this is a copycat product and not an actual real samsung phone. The phone consistently and randomly restarts over and over again. I could be texting or doing work and it shuts down or randomly restarts. I know the seller and amazon wont refund or replace my money for the product so im screwed and stuck with it. I think the next time I buy a Samsung smart phone im going to buy it in the US and directly from the manufacture. I want to make sure it works each and every time and doesn't shut down at critical points in my life.",13,1
Samsung,"The Best Phone Ever Arrived Just Perfectly pretty fast, update it to lollypop 5.1 and no lag so ever, im using it on Venezuela and Works 4G LTE with Movistar and Digitel i haven't tried on Movilnet because that company SUCKS i will buy this phone again",21,5

Samsung,"This phone worked for two months and then locked up. I spoke with my carrier and they were unable to help me. I took it to a Samsung repair store and they tried to reload the operating system but were unable to. When they researched it further, they told me I had to find someone in UK to take it to a repair store there in UK for the operating system to be reloaded. I emailed the company that I purchased this through and they have not responded. I am very unhappy with this product and company.",12,1
Samsung,"Great device. Get this variant of the Note 4 if you want it on U.S. GSM carriers such as Straight Talk, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc. LTE is available with this variant as well. The charger that comes with the device is not for the U.S., but seller did include adapter.",14,5
Samsung,"This phone is a beast with its super octa-core. I absolutely loved this phone for the short time I got to play with it before it decided to take a dump on me and break my heart. First off yes this phone is all that and a bag of chips, sleek, fast and did I mention a beast??? Well right out of the box it had trouble with fluxuations and connecting to towers. It would connect but it wouldnt connect strongly, so I contacted my provider and hey set up a service order to check out and run diagnostics on my local towers to see if they were indeed compatible with this model and if it was then it would tell me that something in the phone was defective. I plugged in it to let it charged while I watched some tv and when I came back the screen had went screwy. Even after removing battery and doing a master factory reset the problem persisted. The problem being that there were hundreds of faint lines running across the screen and a large black mass in the bottom left corner that would grow and dissipate. when the screen was rotated everything would swirl and stay swirled even the colors were off. No the phone was not dropped and yes it had been working fine except for the signal thing before charging. I decided to call Samsung to see if the phone was worth saving but was informed that as it is an international phone it is unable to be worked on unless I lived in Europe as the USA does not work on international phones.So instead of reordering and praying that it will work I am just returning this phone and sucking up loosing the extra fast processor and ordering the slower us model from my carrier. I am doing this solely due to if it breaks in a few months I can get it fixed for free with my warranty where if i bought another international version and it broke I would have to come up with $700 to replace it as it cant be fixed inside the us.",19,3

Samsung,"Wow! I ordered two of these refurbished phones and was surprised at the condition. I looked them over very carefully and could not find any signs of previous use. I have ordered other refurbished phone from the actual carriers that have not looked as good as these. I have not read the other reviews on these phones or the seller, but in my case, I am very well satisfied with the purchase. I have been testing them out for two weeks now, and there has been no malfunction whatsoever. In my case, they look and have been performing as brand new phones. They are set for T-Mobile and had no issue setting them up. Just put in my SIM, and logged in my Google/Android account.",10,5
Samsung,"The phone looked and acted perfect. Only problem is that it was ""blacklisted"" by T-Mobile. After putting the SIM card in, no matter what I did it would not register on the network. T-Mo customer service informed me that the IMEI of this phone (the IMEI is like the SSN of the phone, each handset manufactured has a unique number) was blocked, meaning there was a problem with the previous owner's account. The CS representative could not see the exact reason for the blockage (privacy issue, I would think) but could confirm that the phone was blocked maybe for non-payment or even possibly because it was reported lost or stolen. I just returned it and ordered another one so we'll see if the next gamble pays off.UPDATE 9/8/16 I received another Note 4 and this one is working perfectly from the moment I put my SIM card in it. So just be aware and ready to return if there's any problem. It helped that I had a backup phone during the shipping period. Thanks, Amazon!UPDATE 9/24/16 Ready to return the THIRD phone! Summary:1. Purchased from ELECTRONIC DEALS. Phone was blocked on T-Mobile, but otherwise worked and looked great.2. Purchased from SMART TECH CERTIFIED. This phone had sporadic booting problems, and freezing/lagging issues.3. Purchased from CHUBBIESTECH. This one had power and volume buttons that seemed stuck and wouldn't press, like they were extremely worn. In fact, as soon as the battery went in it booted up without pressing Power! Severe dents and scratches on the metal band around the body of the phone, but the screen was pristine. That makes me think it was replaced, so it can be slightly less water resistant where the adhesive was replaced. Anyway, the buttons were the main problem on this one.Will update on the 4th purchase. I can play this game all month!",71,1
Samsung,"and let me tell you I was terrified. I read the reviews and I felt like it was 50/50 on what I would get delivered. thank goodness I was on the correct end of the 50%. The phone came in on time. Perfectly secured in it's box that looked new (well except the item came in a plain white box0 but it contained the phone, battery, wall adapter, and usb cord. The stylus was there and I couldn't see any scratches or nicks on this phone and let me tell ya...I looked hard. I was satisfied with the external and then I went to insert my SIM card (worked well after a call to my carrier (Metro). Then later that night I received an update that I needed to update it to the latest Android update (and this is where I read that people could have issues). I'm so very happy to report that 1 week later still no issues.So NOW I can buy a case :0",27,5
Samsung,I'm very pleased with my purchase! The phone arrived in perfect condition as good as new. The phone and the battery are functioning like they should. I updated the phone to the latest (T-Mobil) Android 5.1.1 update. I was able to update the phone with my AT&T SIM Card inserted (Prepaid Account) I connected to my home network and selected update. The phone works great and its still unlocked after the the update!FYIThe phone comes with the STANDARD charger and not the 9-VOLT fast charger.UPDATE!!The phone supports fast charging.

All I needed to purchase was a new micro sim card at my local T-Mobile and I was all set. The battery/charger came included with the phone.",14,5
Samsung,"Okay. .. it took 4 phones to get one that's decent enough to keep. .. I would understand some of these things If they were used but they are supposed to be actually refurbished and I can guarantee you that these ""certified refurbished"" are not refurbished at all. ...Phone #1 : perfect in every way except the camera lens was so scratched you couldn't even take a picture I mean badly scratched just looking at the back of the phone you notice the damage easily so it was clearly not refurbished with such an obvious flaw. Seriously refurbished but they don't even test the camera?Phone #2 : Had a bad crackling speaker, damaged stylus and the water damage sticker was showing it had been wet at some point so if it was refurbished they would have put a new water damage sticker on right? Shouldn't matter is just a sticker right? But the fact I got 4 of them and know they aren't refurbished combined with the crackling speaker I'm pretty sure it really was water damaged. Plus the stylus didn't work. ... refurbishing and you don't even test the stylus hmmmmm....Phone #3 : Was not even the correct model number. .. the phone is advertised as a N910t however they sent me a N910t3 which still a note 4, is a different variant and takes different software than the regular n910t. One of the reasons I wanted the phone is because I can put android 4.4 back on it. (It's still my favorite) the t3 variant they sent me already been updated to 6.0 and couldn't go back to 4.4. The regular n910t that's advertised you can load whatever you want on it but not the t3 they sent me. ... also this stylus didn't work right either bummer.Phone #4 : It works and I'm keeping it but the sp02 oxygen saturation sensor doesn't work but not refurbished or it would all work. ......I'm just not sending it back again I'll deal with the broken sp02 sensor. ...Conclusion : not one of the 4 phones ordered had android 4.4 as it's advertised. They either had 5.1 or 6.0. If you get the one advertised the n910t you can roll back to whatever one you want but you can't go back with the n910t3. None of these phones were actually refurbished and with so many things to go wrong your really rolling the dice. .. gps, pulse, sp02, infrared, accelerometers, etc etc etc stylus etc etc there are so many things that can go wrong 2 cameras just so many things that can go wrong you buy a refurbished or new to avoid these problems but there's too many things to go wrong and these are not really refurbished . So when you get your phone make sure you test out every single thing to make sure it all works.",18,1
Samsung,"Great condition works well. Clearly full of bloat ware as it is a unlocked Verizon phone it has all the Verizon crap apps you can not remove without rooting and modding the OS also my last Samsung was a S3 so it didn't have the annoying KNOX on it, again removable if rooted and modded OS. Those are not faults of the seller so not going to remove any stars. The phone is wonderful and I use it on Straight Talk services for 50$ a month unlimited Straight Talk Reps are hard to deal with if you have to call them but make sure you buy the Proper SIM kit ""http://www.amazon.com/Straight-Talk-Verizon-Bring-Activation/dp/B00TRQCOOI?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2"" and activate it online following the directions and everything should be fine and you shouldn't have to talk to ST Rep.",45,5
Samsung,"The device received was not 100% certified, it is DEFECTIVE.

The battery life is also expired as it will not hold a charge long while on, depleting rapidly even with power saving mode, battery saver app, and air plane mode active. If the seller had actually tested the phone to insure functionality they would have found the phone to be compromised, instead of saying it's 100% certified-which is false, the seller should have honorably sent it to the manufacturers warehouse for dismantling. I've had years of experience working for cellular companies and this is the most disappointing buy I've ever had. On top of the device being defective it also arrived a week later after the estimated delivery. I would consider submitting a better review if this device was exchanged with a 100% certified NON-COMPROMISED fully functional device but I'm not sure if the seller can be trusted after this experience.",38,1

What I got was a phone that I could hardly use and it was a miracle everything I managed to get it to charge.So that's really frustrating right? It's ok though, it had a 90 day warranty. Cool. So I contact the seller to get a replacement. Mind you, I use my phone daily for my business that I run and being without a phone is kind of a no go. Well, too bad they said.

Samsung,"N910F is an unlocked phone:This means that you can only connect it to GSM networks (not CDMA networks like Verizon or Sprint).This also means that you will need to add configuration information specific to your service provider.This also means that you can travel with it internationally, and buy local pre-paid SIM cards, so you're paying local rates for local calls and data, vs International rates.AT&T users:The phone comes with basic instructions on how to connect to AT&T, but better instructions are available directly from AT&T [https://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB424489].ROOT users:If you plan to ROOT the device, be aware that you'll need to upgrade it with the version 5.0.1 stock bootloader/firmware first (as it comes with 5.0), otherwise you'll receive a bootup error after you install a rooted ROM. Fortunately, even if you're reading this after you've tried to install a rooted ROM, you can go back and installed the stock 5.01 bootloader, and then re-install the rooted ROM.Transferring an SD card from another phone:If you're using an SD card from a previous phone, even if it's an Android, you'll need to reformat your SD card before installing new apps, otherwise the write permissions will cause an issue were downloads seem to hang.

Samsung,"Product description says unlocked international, but packaging says ""American SIM Card Only""?!?! Also an additional sticker on the side saying activation must be done in Americas. Well, I can't open this just to activate it because it was meant to be a present for my niece. Obviously I'm not going to give her an 'opened' present.",11,1
Samsung,"What they don't tell you is this phone actually is initially region locked, you must put in a US Sim card and make at least one 5 min call using that ... Well thats fine unless you are in Afghanistan ordering a replacement phone and cant use a us sim card for another 6 months.'unlocked international model' is a joke and basically resulted in me spending 750 dollars for a brick.",34,1
Samsung,"I purchased this phone with the intention of using the Gear VR but because this is a Asia Specific phone it does not have Gear VR compatibility. This due the chipset not being correct. A Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 is listed which I went by for confirmation it would work with the Gear VR but this is a Exynos 5433 Octa-core. Big difference for techies, unnoticed by the standard buyer who trusts the listing.",32,1
Samsung,"This phone was not unlocked properly and it is essentially a ""brick."" I was told this by my cell phone carrier and 2 repair shops. They said it is a functioning brick but a brick nonetheless so can't text or receive MMS and other functions are not working. I highly recommend not purchasing anything from these guys because if it does work properly I am guessing it will just be luck",26,1
Samsung,"If you want a review of the ""phone"" itself... Google or read the other reviews here :) There are an abundance of hardware reviews and comparisons. There seem to be 2 types of people here on Amazon... those who think reviews should be of the product and those who think they should be of the ordering experience from the specified vendor. The way I see it, you wouldn't be ordering from Amazon if you didn't already know what you wanted therefor my review will be of the experience.As for this order from NGP (specifically) the experience has been awesome! Communicated with NGP multiple times with very quick responses and friendly service. I received the black SM-N910U (Hong Kong) Exynos Octacore model with everything I would expect from a quality Amazon order experience. The device itself was perfect, packaged very well, brand new (in case people were worried about being ripped off).This is my first ""international"" model so there were a few things I didn't expect...While packaged extremely well, the retail box was previously opened and the contents inspected at US customs (or perhaps by FedEx themselves, not really sure). The phone itself had even been turned on with the initial setup process already gone through so I had to perform a factory reset. FYI this is much easier to do from the recovery partition of the phone (Google if you don't know what that is) than from the UI because everything was in Chinese. I completely forgot about AC adapters being different so the stock adapter is an EU 220. However, NGP is kind enough to include a US 120 adapter that fits onto the stock 220. I'll definitely be ordering a standard US 120 adapter directly from Samsung when they become available. You can use any USB charging adapter you want but you won't be able to take advantage of ""Adaptive Fast Charging"" without a STOCK power adapter for the Note 4: called an Adaptive Charger.So... 5 stars for an excellent device, excellent vendor, and an excellent experience!UPDATE: It was not inspected (opened) by customs. It was, in fact, opened by NGP to perform an on/off test. Apparently they do this to reduce the number of returns. So... if that bothers you, you might want to look elsewhere for this device. Otherwise, they still get 5 stars from me.REMEMBER: This is the SM-N910U Exynos model. You'll get octacore but you'll use AT&T 4G/LTE.",21,5
Samsung,"The item turned out to be a fake Note 4. Beware. That model, the N910H, is the Asian model.",18,1
Samsung,"This is a brazen, no 4LTE, it's like having a Mercedes Benz without wheels",15,1

Spent so much on this phone and not even last two months. Complete GARBAGE! Will me making a formal complaint with this company this is highly unacceptable. Definitely lost my trust in buying products from Amazon.",17,1

Samsung,I am in love with this phone. The process of switching my information was very easy and took about 5 minutes. The phone looks brand new and the charger is great! So glad I did this!,12,5
Samsung,"Very good phone with state of the art design and performance. However, quite fragile, slippery hold (you need to by a skin or case if you don't want to lose it) and close to non-resistant at all to any water exposure. Samsung happily refused to repair my unit (water spill damage) even when I proposed to pay for the repair. I had to go through three phone repairers to finally find one who wanted to give it a try, under the condition that I signed a disclaimer form saying he would not be liable in case he broke anything, the glass in particular.Personally, after the S6 complete lock followed now by this bad experience with the Note 5 (total: 1'500$) made me reconsider my adhesion to Samsung phones. I will prioritize buying from another manufacturer next. At premium price, this strategy is not acceptable: I would never have been denied repair service at an Apple shop, they would just have refused to cover it through the warranty, which I fully understand.You can trust the seller though, excellent contact, feedback and rapid answers to email questions. I just recommend buying another model.UPDATE 2016/02/13:Three phone repairers have now refused to open the Note 5 for fear of breaking its glasses/screen. I have also now been in direct contact with Samsung and offered to pay for the reparation (it only has a damaged microphone): Samsung refuses on grounds that the phone is an international model and only US carrier locked models can be repaired. I contacted a journalist and filed a complaint at the the consumer defense agency for the State of Massachusetts, more information might come soon.",10,1
Samsung,"Excellent service! I previously had a Galaxy Note 5 from T-Mobile but I had to return it because I use to travel a lot and I needed an unlocked phone. The Galaxy Note 5 in White Pearl unlocked is not available online (because of National Backorder) so I found this Dual Sim Card International Version and I love it! I can keep both of my sim cards inside the phone (1 from M??xico & 1 from the states) so every time I change from one country no another I not longer have to take my sim card out in order to put the one that I need. I just go to settings, turn off one of the sim card 1 and turn on the sim card 2 and that's it. I also have noticed that the battery life in the international version is longer than the T-Mobile/AT&T version. The only thing I complain is that the phone doesn't came with the Samsung Pay app installed so I think I have to wait until Samsung release it to download it.",12,5
Samsung,"1 Best phone in the market right now.2 Cons Why everyone picking on samsung I phones never had removable batteries or micro sd expansion.3 They are not the 1st to make a phone with a glass back or with glass overall all phones have glass screens so if you don't want to damage your 750 dollar phone pick up a 15 dollar case and a 10 dollar tempered glass screen protector.4. Samsung is a company yes. They are in Business to make money right not for people to like them or make friends they have demographics that they work out to know what individuals like. It does work because they are number one cellular phone manufacturer by volume globally, however not in the USA or China, Apple is because Americans typically like apple so to become number 1 in the largest market in the world you have to be Apple and be better than apple, that's what they are doing that's not exactly a bad thing.5. Global policy makers are having companies move towards technologies such as cloud storage, biometrics, and always on cellular devices on each person thats where Global policies are now I dont agree with it but it is what it is.6. The phone is a well constructed beautifully engineered device it is fast elegant and powerful, its full of features simple and can be pretty much anything you want it to be software wise if u need 1 home screen and 1 app screen with 10 apps you can do that if you need 7 or more home screens and a lot of apps you can do that as well.7. This phone is not for everyone, if enough people don't like it vote with your dollars and it may change.8. I Personally love the device its quick full of specs ans charges from 0 to 100 in around an hour and 20 mins gives me around 4 and a half hours to 5 and a half hours of screen on time or around a day on a half I am not big into apps and all that most of the apps I use are already pre installed in big into media consumption chrome-casting to my TV and all that.9. This phone is not perfect to me either i believe Samsung could have built in a micro SD slot along with the sim card slot, include an IR blaster and that S6 edge+ if it was a Note 5 Edge i would have been reviewing a different phone today. A Note 5 edge with IR blaster and micro SD expansion would have been my perfect phone.10. The battery is 3000 MAh and is greatly optimized to provide better battery life.11. It has 4 Gb of DDR4 Ram a lot of laptops don't have that and trust me it works it pushes through this beautiful Super Amoled 2K screen like it wasn't even there.It is a beast its over priced 550 to 600 is what i would value it at for a phone Im only gonna keep for a year i still payed 750 for it though still not 100% sure why guess I was feeling kinda ball-ish but when I buy a phone like this personally its for 70% emotional reason and 30% piratical because its really and truly dollar for dollar not worth it especially when it can fall into a gutter or pool of water n be toasted and ma weeks pay is gone just like that.12. All these people leaving negative reviews um did you read the specifications and then make your purchase because complaining about the phone doesn't have a micro SD expansion and replaceable battery is like buying a Mercedes Benz and complaining that it doesn't have a flat bed :/ and frankly I wouldn't take a review from a person that doesn't read what hes about to dish out 750 bucks about serious its as thou your an impulse buyer.13. This is the best phone in the market right now I am a note user i love the big screen the multitasking features and powerful specs samsung galaxy notes come with I've had the note 1 the note 3 and now the note 5 and have never no regrets yet as I said before its not perfect my perfect phone is a galaxy note 5 edge with a micro SD expansion slot and an IR blaster but I love using the S pen in class as im a student to do maths take notes and remind my classmates that they are minions with their HTC and Iphone.",46,5
Samsung,It's not unlocked. Whhhy.,29,1
Samsung,"The S Pen flew apart in my hand under the pressure of the spring. The glue must be faulty. I have contacted the seller, but received no response. Really frustrated. I am not about to buy a new pen.",18,1
Samsung,"I upgraded from a Note 4 and the Note 5 is beautiful. I used to have the color white, so I purchased the gold. I am not a techy person so I wont go too much into detail. The only negative things I have to say about the Note 5 is the obvious lack of expandable storage and removable battery, but Samsung announced they will be bringing it back. However, I am okay with the storage amount on this device.I was a little nervous about purchasing a phone on Amazon, especially an international version. I was not sure of the difference but I do not notice anything. Everything arrived safely and on time. The phone arrived in an original Samsung box with the Samsung headphones and a UK style Samsung wall adapter. I was concerned over this, but after double-checking the box, the seller supplied me with a U.S. adapter. This was awesome because my phone still recognized it was a fast travel charger, even with the adapter. I used to have a TMobile Note 4 with a StraightTalk micro sim. The Note 5 is nano size, so I had to purchase a new one. Transferring my number was an easy process that only lasted a few hours, which is normal. The SM-N920C (Note 5) is 4G LTE capable. I was panicking at first because it only said 4G on the status bar, but it is just cosmetic. It is 4G LTE, but it says 4G. The phone is fast with and without wifi.I love the Galaxy Note models because of the S Pen. On the Note 4, you just pull the S Pen out but on this model, you have to push it in to get it out. It is a little new for me, but it is not something I cant get used to. The functionality of the S Pen is excellent. It also looks really nice.There is no lagging on the Note 5. Everything processes smoothly. I am such a big fan of Samsung and I am amazed by all of the things this device can do. I am a college student and it just helps me with my daily tasks and I also love to stream videos and music. I can tell you the Note 5 screen looks way better on the Note 5 than the Note 4. The Note 4 is a great phone, but if you have the chance to upgrade, do it!I know most of my review was a comparison between Note 4 and 5 but I was trying to give as much detail as possible :) comment if you have any questions.",17,5
Samsung,"Warning: This is not a US-based phone and Samsung advertisements and support do not match this phone's features. It's not compatible with many of the features you may have expected it to be.For example, they are currently running a promotion for a $200 certificate if you buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and activate Samsung Pay -- but apparently Samsung Pay is not supported on this phone. When I reached out to Samsung tech support about it, the tech claimed that this particular phone is not eligible, and they wouldn't discuss the certificate. I even checked the fine print and could not find the details -- all of the ads just say that the ""Note 5"" is eligible.Microsoft office (and other apps): There are a number of apps on the Google Play store that are listed as ""not compatible"" and can't be installed, including Microsoft office -- the free Microsoft office for android is a staple for mobile devices, so seeing that this isn't supported is a shock.Additionally, my experience with Samsung tech support were terrible. The person over chat was not helpful, and told me to call tech support. When I called tech support, they disconnected me twice. At one point, they even seemed to connect me to some sort of spam service that was trying to sell me on some things that sounded like a hoax (a $100 certificate for $2 and a free ""help I've fallen and I can't get up"" type monitor) -- the only thing I can imagine is that instead of connecting me internally, they misdialed. After 3 attempts, I still have not talked to a right person.So beware that you may not be getting what's advertised, and that tech support may not supportive in solving problems (Samsung is a far cry from Apple and Amazon support which is always great).",19,1
Samsung,this is not a usa phone even though it is said so in the product description.It got exposed when we try to install samsung pay.samsung pay doesnt work because not a USA phone.someone responded back after talking to samsung guys that this phone is a europe phone.Note 5 is good but i think seller is cheating in a way saying it is a USA phone.,11,3
Samsung,Phone is being flaky after only a month. Called samsung warranty service and found out this is an INTERNATIONAL version so it has a different process to go through. I don't know what the real difference is except that they do not have as good of a warranty. It is tacky that this info was left off the item description.,32,1
Samsung,"I really feel like I was scammed, the phone itself.. I mean the REAL Galaxy Note 5 is amazing, my friend has it and I loved it so I decided to buy it for myself, after watching reviews I knew I had to have this phone! I bit the bullet so to speak and found it on amazon, used for a cheaper price!Since I know amazon has a great return policy I decided to buy it.I was pleasantly surprised though the description said there were scratches I didn't see a single scratch! great huh :-) I was so excited decided to start checking out the features of the phone, the main feature I loved about this phone was the off-screen note option so I pushed the stylus... nothing... I dug my finger under the stylus and realized that it isn't the correct stylus for the phone, looked on amazon and seen an OEM stylus for 9.99 so no problem :-) I figure the feature didn't work because the stylus was incorrect. As I got deeper into the phone I realized several very important things, the most important was that there was no IMEI number so I can't get it activated, it was only after I connected to the internet via wifi that I seen an IMEI number and checked it out on snafu and it was invalid, I should've guessed considering the last numbers were 123456..but my dismay didn't stop there!! I looked into the gallery and there were two videos on the s.d card.. yes the non-existent s.d card, both videos were of something in an Chinese/Vietnamese?? I don't speak or understand the language to tell which language it was but I am guessing Chinese.syrI looked into my settings, and clicked on storage and seen that the actual phone onlly has 8gb of storage but the sd card is 32 gb isn't that strange?I started playing with the settings and so many of the amazing features didn't work on the phone, besides the fact that I can't even get it activated which makes it just a tablet for me.I am not saying all of the sellers here are dishonest, I don't even believe that amazon warehouse is dishonest, however when buying it make sure to ask the seller for the IMEI number in advance.I just went to the browser to actually leave this review and it's in Chinese. so I had to use my computer.I will try to do a video review tomorrow to show all of the things I mentioned and more,",12,1
Samsung,"I purchased this phone because I didn't want a contract and it seemed like a nice upgrade. The phone works fine but coming from an S5 I fond myself questioning some of its missing features. I can live without waterproofing, but no IR blaster and no SD card was hard to swallow.However, I decided to try it. So far its been great but I figured out really fast that I had purchased a strange version. I received the SM-N920G, which is not compatible with Samsung pay and who knows what else. I initially rooted the phone but decided to revert back. That was the most painful process ever. When looking for the firmware the n920g has about 40 versions for different countries. After a few tries I got one to flash properly.That being said, that was my choice and my fault, I kust figured I would give people a heads up. The phone looks extremely high end. The size is perfect for me and I love the phablet like features like the email landscape view and running multiple apps. The camera is one of the bests I have seen. The only complaint I have is the battery. It seems to die really fast, even after the inital new phone syndrome wears off. I make it from 7:00AM to about 6:00PM, then I have to charge. I have battery saver on and I am optimizing everything. Kther than battery I have no complaints.",21,4

Samsung,"Unfortunately this review comes a little late in the game, and likely wouldn't have even happened had I not smashed my Galaxy S5. - Quick Background - I am in the tech industry by trade, and have been an android user since the Motorola Droid first arrived. My recording studio is exclusively Apple Products, though only out of necessity due to the software tools I create music with. (...and though I don't look down on the iPhone community, I personally would never choose to own one.) -I don't jump on the finance and upgrade bandwagon, so I haven't used the S6, S7, or S7 Note/PocketBomb. They are probably exceptional pieces of hardware, though the reason I clung so tightly to the S5 was sheer durability. It just worked for me, aside from being just a tiny bit small for my hands. If it hadn't met an untimely death leaping from my car, it would, no doubt, have required extensive counseling.Moving on-The Note 5 is a powerhouse compared to the Galaxy S5.The additional four (total eight) faster processor cores and additional ram (3Gb in all - S5 just 2) is more than a little noticeable. Multitasking is a snap for everything I do: Email/Text/Calls, Recording sound for later use, Maps, Ingress, Web Application like Soundcloud to manage the songs I post-...you get the idea. I'm not leeched to my phone constantly, but I am a heavy multitasker when I do. It also fits perfectly in my man-sized mitts. My thumbs are no longer cramped - but most importantly - no one will ever read this. Let's be honest - this is old tech now. I could perfectly detail through eloquent fervor the ample screen's lush vibrancy, or use teh bestest of internet wordz 2 tell u how gr8 the pics r ...or even just simply go over the camera features -like the lens' quick focus speed...Alas, you've all moved on to the new-new. So instead, I will sum up the phone in a Haiku that will live eternal via the interwebs long after I have been placed in the ground. Such is internet life: A vacant blip of Caligul-ain competition to be deemed valuable through written expression.In this case, an outdated, though not yet obsolete device designed to mask it's guardian from the concept of a life wasted.And now, your Haiku:Bountiful Specs,but no external SD.Purchase without Fear.",13,4

Samsung,"I previously had the Samsung Proclaim on Straight Talk (Verizon towers). I wanted a larger screen and Straight Talk told me that I had to go with an AT&T compatible phone, so I chose the Note. Since this phone was less than half the cost of the S4, I chose it.

Samsung,"I am so excited I got my phone a today. I couldn't wait to swap the sim card from my old phone to this one. This phone does everything that they say and more. But I had a problem because my service carrier is T-Mobile and this came in an AT&T packaging, I set up my phone and everything was running smooth except making and receiving calls. So it was time to call T-Mobile customer care to connect my phone for me. That's when the problem started. I was on the phone with a service rep for almost an hour. She did everything she could to connect this phone on the network and it couldn't work. My guess is that this phone is not unlocked because the lady that was helping me told me that there's nothing wrong with the connection nor the sim card but the phone itself is not unlocked so therefore it won't work on T-Mobile network. She said that after she suggested that I should put the sim card back to my old phone to see what happens and the phone worked perfectly.I am not going to throw any stones yet, I'm going to call the seller and let them know what happened and see what their response is going to be. I gave it a 4 because it couldn't work when it was supposed to but neither than that, I'd have give it a 5 star rating. It's a great phone. Big and clear screen resolution. I can check my email and go on Facebook and You tube even though it's not connected on any network. It really is a kool phone, I like it, no let me rephrase that, I love it a lot. I just wish that my little problem with it is going to be solved sooner than later. Otherwise I will recommend it to anyone especially if your service provider is AT&T.",49,4
Samsung,"This thing is great so far. Got it in the mail super-quick. The big screen is awesome coz I dont have to squint at anything. Comes with Jelly Bean 4.1.2 OS on it right out of the box! This device is also great for folks with not-so-small hands, feels more comfortable than a regular-sized phone. Read other reviews (not amazon) and some folks complained about the battery life for this device. (This thing get awesome battery life so far, puts my old motorola smartphone to shame!) Anyways, here are a couple tips that I'm sure those folks didn't follow... First, do a few charge-discharge cycles, which means start using the phone as soon as u can, let the battery run down to 5% to no more than 15%. (DO NOT RUN THE BATTERY DOWN TO 0% AT FIRST) Batteries these days have their own sort of ""memory"", so if u charge your phone when it's at 50% for example, the phone may think that the battery is almost dead when it shows 50%. Ok, after u r sure the device's battery is at 5% to 15% charge, let it charge to 100%. To get a true 100% charge u have to let the device's battery charge while the device is turned off. Again, that part about the 'memory' of the battery: if u let it charge to a true 100%, it will charge more fully more often. Repeat those steps at least 3 times. Futhermore, the Galaxy Note should ideally only need 2.5 to 3 hours to fully charge the battery, so........ DO NOT CHARGE OVERNIGHT, AS THIS CAN WEAKEN THE BATTERY LIFE in the short term and the long term. If people do all these things for their device's battery (Galaxy Note or not) it can extend the battery's performance. I'd HIGHLY recommend this device to anyone needing a solid, well-constructed, comfortable device. Phone calls work good (i'm on at&t prepaid), texts, instant chats, the S-Pen, it all works great. If u properly charge the battery, the battery life issue that others have had, should not be a problem for you. Enjoy!",47,5

Samsung,I ordered this galaxy note that cost me over $600 and I had chosen 1 day shipping. The seller said they would mail it out Monday for sure and didn't mail it out til Tuesday. The phone that was supposedly unlocked kept losing signal and had very bad echoing problems. The phone would lose signal after almost every phone call or texts and we would have to reboot. Then when we returned the phone almost a month ago.. Still no refund and now out of phone.,11,1
Samsung,"Received absolutely brand new phone from seller ""Wireless Extra"". This phone is unlocked as described. And the screen is huge, sharp and clear. HD movies play beautifully. Came with the latest Jellybean 4.1.2 installed, awesome!Yes, for many of you who wanted a prepaid phone, it works for Straight Talk (AT&T Sim Card) and T-Mobile. I tried on both networks and all have 4G LTE speed. Great I ditched my Sprint and go for prepaid plan, saving lots of money. I'll give MetroPCS a shot after I'm done with Straight Talk. Will update how MetroPCS network speed.Run Speedtest.net on ATT and T-Mobile 4G LTE hit over 10Mbps without any problem. I have better LTE rate on T-Mobile than AT&T.However it does have some flaws as well - Bloatware, a lot of them. AT&T preloaded bunch of their home brewed bloatware. They eat up tons of internal memory. Unless you rooted your phone and removed those unwanted apps, you just have to live with them and they do drag the overall performance.You will see lags when you launch phone dialer or switching between apps. Considering it's a 2-year-old phone with just dual core and 1GB RAM, I can live with that for a sub $300 price phone.Battery life is miserable. It couldn't even last 8 hours of normal usage. Need to charge everyday and in the car to keep it floating.Overall this is definitely a great phone for it's quality and price. Highly recommended.Updated: Called MetroPCS and tried to use their service. What a joke, their customer said my phone is still locked! I have been with T-mobile prepaid and Straighttalk and no problem at all. That's why this company is dead and bought by T-mobile. You can't activate the SIM Card online and you need to call them and the customer service knows nothing. Hello, this is year 2013 and people still need to call to activate a service and nope you can't do it online.",11,5

Samsung,I bought it unlocked to use on T-Mobile for $30 a month. Can't beat it. The phone is plenty fast with the expandable memory and removable battery features. It came with gingerbread and shortly after I updated to ICS. Can't wait for Sammy to put Jelly bean on it.,32,5
Samsung,"From reading ALL of the reviews before I bought this phone, I wasn't convinced. Most of the reviews left for this phone let me down. I was very pleased to find a phone with great specifications and an unbeatable price, but reading the reviews made me think twice.. I took my chances and bought the phone which it shipped in 3-4 days of purchase. When I opened it, the phone was in its original packaging plus they threw in a FREE pair of earphones. My carrier was tmobile and it worked fine when I inserted my sim. Everything was just as i hoped! Then the battery life was acting up. The battery just drains by itself....it may be due to the gigantic screen, so buy a 3000mah battery just in case. I love the phone and NO it's not slow...it's amazingly fast....I suggest you buy ""new"" from LUCKY BUY RETAILERS. ~ Dawit",29,4
Samsung,"I must start by saying ""I love my new phablet"". To be honest the seller did not truely described how pristine the device was; literally. The package included a brand new charger, protective screen and a hard case. I must say I got more than what I payed for.Pros: A huge screen, Lots of apps, S-Pen is wonderful,Cons: The batteryAll in all apart from the battery its an alround device that gets me through the day",12,5
Samsung,"For the price, the Samsung Galaxy Note i717 is an excellent phone with a stunning screen. The upgrade from ICS to JellyBean 4.1.2 was a breeze. Enjoy.",12,5
Samsung,"I got this phone jan 2014. It is an old version of the note but this phone is way better than any other I have ever had. The screen is amazing and humongous making youtube, surfing and netflixing awesome. Just keep your charger with you. The things you love to do on your cellphone, especially this one, will drain the battery. I purchased a trident case for it. I just drop the phone for fun now. The case is awesome too!!!!!",12,5
Samsung,I got this item in quite quickly although it was not what I had expected at all. At first glance the phone seem wonderful until I noticed adhesive glue sticki sticking out of the screen where it had been replaced. Then at the bottom the frame was bend showing the charging connection through the bend and the screen... I immediately messaged them about this... as I see up the phone and turned it on the keyboard went completely crazy. There's a picture in the back ground of my screen that shows off a yellow tint and I can read it as it says in big letters media hub hd and the bottom says gaming in really big letters. Only part of the screentthat's normal is a strip down the right side :( very frustrating at this point I go online using the phone to email them again and it keeps sending me to time format ugh.. then goes back to home screen no matter what I push.. if that isn't bad then it keeps showing bright colors as I glitches as if it is completely water damaged... I'm truly sad as I had my hopes up so high as to replace this phone I love this brand so dearly. And I'm not sure what this means but the phone keeps telling me that a format has been downloaded and updated but there's an error in the format process.. what is that!? Still waiting to hear back from them and hoping I can get a good phone or a refund so that I can get a decent one. :( just hoped they would have tested the product out before sending it off.,12,1
Samsung,"Love this device because it can be handled as a phone or a small tablet. It's is arguable that it is mainly a phone but its functions says otherwise. I use it as a tablet first for prodction, school work, etc. then phone secondary, for, of course, for communication/text, calls, etc. It is the a perfect size if you don't think of it as a phone only (and folks seem intimidated by ""big phones"").I won't get into the techncial specifics but basically, it's the same as Samsung Galaxy SII with little exceptions. I've upgraded to OS JellyBean, and love the extras in the stylus however, the stylus can go a little out of control on keyboards.I don't like how the power button is positioned exactly opposite the volume control on the other side of the phone. I clasp the device, using my thumb to powerup/down but find that my other four fingers are latched onto the volume control. Hard to keep away from, so it calls for using 2 hands (which I'm trying to avoid if I'm not using it as a tablet). S Note app is a bit annoying. I don't need to use a template but it won't let me create a note without one (at lease I haven't figured out how to control that yet).Nevertheless, the device runs and displays my applications very well. I am encouraged to watch Netflix, and run bigger apps with ease. Battery runs out at normal rate (depending on what you run and how long) but I'd suggest backup batteries when you know a powersouce wll not be accessible.",22,4
Samsung,"I ordered this phone expecting to have a great experience with it, but as soon as I received it and inserted my att go phone sims card in it, it said no registered network....It won't let me make phone calls or anything! I'm really upset with this problem. Does anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening??? I know that my sims card works because it was working perfectly fine in my other phone and the Note is supposedly suppose to be unlocked.. I even took it to att and they tried four different sims cards in it and it said the same thing about ""No Registered Network."" Could it be that the seller sent me a locked phone???? Any help would be greatly appreciated!! I really love this phone, but it's pretty useless to me when I can't even make a phone call on it.",13,2
Samsung,I would consider this to be one of the best services that I ever got on my online service purchase. I got the phone on prompt time considering that it was an APO Address. The phone itself is exactly as describes and performs to the required standards. It is truly an Unlocked phone and the size is what makes it Rock.. It performs the work of a phone as well as a Tablet. I can't wait to take it back to Kenya and brag.I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who aspires to have a phone with large display and a Tablet with a smaller screen.,14,5
Samsung,"After a week of jacking around with Straight Talk, I finally got the correct Sim Card to use, which by the way is an AT&T Compatible, Regular Sized Sim Card...also called the ""Mini-Sim."" It's helpful to know that this card is ""25mm x 15mm."" After you select either AT&T or T-Mobile, you get to choose Micro or Regular Sized Sim for AT&T. T-Mobile only offers the Regular Sized Sim, they don't use the ""Micro Sim,"" at least with Straight Talk they don't.I downloaded the Straight Talk APN program but never could get it to work properly. I had the settings already written down so it was easy to just do it myself. If anyone has any questions about the APN settings, feel free to ask while fresh in my mind.There has been no weirdness about anything on this phone....everything works perfectly. I just love the big screen and the way videos look. I feel privileged to have gotten such a nice phone. When ordering it from Wireless Experts, they guarantee the phone as new and state what's in the box. They're also are partnered with Amazon so I felt I made a good choice. It's true what they say about the battery using up a lot of juice. I'm going to try some alternative measures to see if that helps the battery. Time will tell. I'll check back in periodically and let you know if it's still going good.See my update below this post about learning I had a 1 Year Samsung Warranty on Parts and Labor.",14,5
Samsung,"I originally could not wait to get this phone. I paid over $450 for it and I thought this was an okay price. However, it has not held up. This note wont hold a charge because that part of the phone doesn't work properly any more and when using the phone from the handset everybody says it sounds like i'm in a tunnel but on speaker phone it's fine. after having these problems i learned I bought it as is but I thought it was brand new. I didn't realize there was't even a factory warranty on this phone. much sure you do your homework before you purchase.",18,3
Samsung,"Everything is great with this phone after 9 days of use.Phone arrived sealed in packaging.Right out of the box,I inserted my family mobile sim card and the battery.Gave it a full charge,powered it up, and bam,made a phone call.The phone I received has android 4.04 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I think the firmware is upgradeable to 4.12 (jellybean). I have put a few apps on it,and have not found a reason to upgrade firmware yet.The phone is doing everything I need it to do so far (flawlessly).With mild text,calls,and fair internet usage at night,I'm gettin about 15 to 16 hrs of Battery between charges.This is a very big phone,but can still fit in someones pocket. I got a thin case for mine,and fabricated my own streamline (trustworthy) Holster.",15,5
Samsung,After 3 months of usage. I am facing quite a big draw back on the performance.Any application takes more than a minute to open and the phones seems to have slowed down considerably.Not a good buy,15,2
Samsung,"...there was a phone that was wonderful. It had many features, functions, and fruits of labor.It is a big phone. So think twice about how you will carry it around with you.I have been poking about with this phone since I got it yesterday, and it has so many things to learn that I will take a long time before I figure out all of it. From what I have seen, there is a lot customization allowed along with a lot of pre-loaded apps. Example: The memo app is very nice for it to allow stylus writing, text writing, attachment insertion, voice writing/recording, ability to share it, etc...The connectivity of the phone is also very strong. It seems a bit slow with hotmail for some reason, but everything else runs fast involving the net (4G / Wifi home speed).The camera captures great detail. Dual camera is a nice option. I have yet to test it for video calls.It has a fast-charging, removable battery. The charge seems to last quite a while (I keep power saving features on such as screen turning off after a minute.). There are many options to optimize your battery life when it is idle or to make sure your phone functions are not disabled if you want them to remain connected.The phone allows for expandable storage which is essential, in my opinion. There seems to be an option to transfer apps from the phone to the microSD card as well.The product for the price is great. If you have time, the Galaxy Note 2 might drop a bit more in price. But at the current time, it just costs too much when the Galaxy Note 1 (this product) is a nice thing for everyone to have. Tablet + Phone = Excellent idea.",16,5
Samsung,"i was kind of worried because of some of the reviews but this phone is amazing, i don't think ill ever go back to a small phone",16,5
Samsung,"Like the title states, i actually love this device so much and it performs so flawlessly, there is absolutely no reason to root.In the past there was the need to install voodoo lag fix, aps to SD, change LCD density, take screen shots, remove bloatware, tether hotspot, overclock to get better performance, maybe install ROMS that had unofficial latest updates of Android O/S, maybe to get some latest & greatest cloned features of the newest smartphone....etc etc etc...Rooting always had risks involved, but i always found it WORTH THE CHANCE,to be able to ""enjoy my phone to the max""....Well, guess what? Samsung has delivered every possible above named scenerio all in one SUPERPHONE!Mind you, with my other phones, i ALWAYS rooted within one hour of owning... Going on 3 whole days here and there's not a chance i would put my new little Angel in possible harms way for little or no gain that root provides.Don't get me wrong, IF you truly know what your doing, rooting & ROM'ing is awesome...I however, never could grasp a full understanding of the internal workings of android no matter how much i read, and therefore when i would root, things sometimes would go wrong, i found it very stressful, even tho very necessary... But that was then, & thanx to the G-Note 2, THIS is now... No root for this gal : )Pros:First and foremost, smooth feel and amazing touch sensitivity of screen....HD Super Amoled is as good or better than S Amoled Plus - quality of images and fonts is best I have ever seen on any phoneSooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lag and i already have 50+ apps addedSo many amazing exclusive Samsung features (motion/Sbeam/S-pen etc)Sooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lagExcellent build qualitySooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lagVery loud volumeSooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lagBattery life is fantastic..Play with it nonstop all day still over 50%Sooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lag2GB Ram & 1.6 Quad Core Exynos proc... wowza!Camera is fast and great qualityJellybean O/S on this phone is the icing on the cake..oh & did i mention its sooooo fast? lolSeriously, a better Android experience you WILL NOT FIND.And if you think its too big, think about this: Experts predict just about EVERYONE will have 5-6 inch devices as their personal device within 2 yearsTGG*****UPDATE*****STRAIGHT TALK:Wanted to add what i put in that other post for anyone thinking of buying & using this device with Straight Talk- It works awesome:I saw their poor coverage map when i first signed on 5 mos ago and i was like ""whaaaa?"" I was amazed they could generate business with such a poor map on their OWN site but then because sooooo many ppl said they were getting great coverage despite those maps, i figured i'd TRY it. I figured i'd run BOTH for one month (at a cost of 45.00 + 15.00 activ fee) but honestly after just 3 days coverage was so awesome and comparable to AT&T i cancelled ATT immediately and from that point on never ONCE had an issue. ST is unlike most bargains because this gift keeps on giving with every months bill : )*****UPDATE*****Regarding NO WARRANTY:The company i purchased from (WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTORS) ships out of California and all their devices are from ONE place (Samsung UK and the device has a 30 day warranty with THEM & then a 1 year mfg with Samsung UK. I asked her how painful the process is and she said she had to send them her own personal device last year and it was a totally non hassel experience, cost her nothing and she said she was without the phone for just 2 weeks...They welcome any questions before ordering (theres a 1-888# in their profile) so nice & helpful. They have high ratings, 33000+ this year alone. For just 29.00 they Fed Exed overnite. Very happy with my purchase*****UPDATE*****TWO WEEKS LATER:Not one complaint and i am still in complete awe of how flawlessly this device runs. Not one issue : ) This is the FIRST device i ever had where i didn't notice a ""ticking clock of my 14 or 30 day return period"".From practically the moment i turned it on and began using it, it was ""home"" and there was just no way i would want to return it and wait for the ""the next best thing""... I honestly can see being happy with the device for at least ONE YEAR (maybe even more!) regardless of what comes out.And i still wouldn't dream of rooting it, and this is from someone that has rooted approx 30 devices and in the past wouldn't even consider using an UNROOTED Android device : )Straight Talk still running flawlessly on it, avg approx 3-5MB consistantly....",62,5
Samsung,"Just got my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 from Worldwide Distributor.It's a white device and international unlocked N-7100.It's very awesome, and the whole device, I don't see a single problem.The device runs fast and zero lag.Love this device so much.",14,5
Samsung,"I won't go into deals about the phone because I think others have done really good reviews (read reviews from the gray phone as well) but I will go into details about my experience.Here are few things I want to focus on:1- INTEGRATION: what I mean here is the integration between apps and the main functionality of the phone. I use the calling feature a lot ( expected ) but also I don't want to launch each individual social app to find someone I want to SMS/Chat/Call. Basically it has a ""universal"" contacts so if you use Tango/Viper/WhatsApp/Skype/Google Voice you will find it so easy to find the person and do whatever you want. I make lots of international calls so I use 3rd party app to make phone calls (along with GVoice). I've used this 3rd party with the iPhone but it was buggy and it always crashes plus I have to launch it each time and find a person to call. With Android, I can just configure the app to be used when I call internationally. The same goes for Google Voice.2- NOTIFICATION: I use social apps like WhatsApp alot but with the iPhone it used to drain battery and not work properly with the iOS notification. I've to open it all the time to make sure someone is talking to me. The notification for this phone (probably Android thing) is just amazing. With the power and memory of this phone, all apps just push their notification smoothly. Slide down with your finger from top to bottom and you see all your notifications. It could get annoying but you can always turn it off or silent your phone.3- S-PEN: As others have mentioned, this is probably the best part of the phone. I can't imagine not using it and believe me you will just love it. It has so much features and is very precise when writing. I use it almost all the time.4- BATTERY: I charge the phone at night only. I use it from the time I wake up till I charge it again at midnight. I won't exaggerate if I say that I use it heavily from sending emails, to lots of FB to youtube to all social apps (Skype/SMS/WhatsApp/Viper/Tango) to email and lots of browsing and it will survive till the end of the day. The screen is almost on 75% of the time. I have to say that while it is not a PC but I've not used my PC that much since I got this phone.5- SPEED: with all the points above, switching between all the apps I work with is just blazing fast. No lag whatsoever. It is very fast and loads quickly.6- MULTI-TASKING: You can literally use two apps at the same time (not all apps though). Just drag an app from the side menu to the screen and it will split both ups (top and bottom)7- AUTO-COMPLETE/SENTENCE COMPLETION: it is so amazing smart I literally type few letters and it gives me so many options to finish. It also predicts the next word based on your selection and you type a 15 words SMS in 5 seconds. As an FYI, it does this for more than ONE language I use (English/Arabic). With the iPhone, it was really a piss off. Each time it overwrites what I type and I keep hitting the erase/back key on the keyboard.8- CONTINUOUS WRITING: For both languages I use - again - I just move the S-PEN (or my finger) on the keyboard and it will accurately finish words for me. I am honestly surprised at its accuracy. About 90% of the time it is always correct. English accuracy is higher than when I type in Arabic.9- SIMPLE MOBILE/T-MOBILE: I live in Northern VA and there are so many new towers with the 1900 band. However only when I am next to them I get 3G/HSPA+ but the speed - while driving; I know :) - is about 5.5Mbps down and 2.5Mbps uploads. 99.9% of the time I am on EDGE. I might move to Simple Talk but to be honest I do a lot of SMS internationally. If Simple Talk will cut off my line when sending couple of International SMSs then that would be crazy. The majority of my time is at work or at my home. At work I use the PC so I don't care about 3G/4G while at home I use my Wifi. At the end of the day, you need to really evaluate your needs. EDGE is more than enough for me for email/light social apps.10- TABLET ALTERNATIVE: I would only use a table for reading books since I've 100's of technical PDF books. I've read few large Apress PDF technical books and I can see myself reading from this phone straight. I don't think it will be ideal but it was just so hard on the iPhone since I was constantly zooming in and out.11- FINGERPRINTS: I am not sure if I read some reviews that said it does not get fingerprints easily but this is not true. It is like a magnet and don't listen to their reviews.Finally, I was lucky to get my two phones from Amazon LLC and not a third party seller. I just don't trust these guys for the amount I paid for my phones and I was lucky to get the last two white ones. I've really enjoyed the phone every time I use it and it is worth every penny. I don't think I need to jump to any phone for few years to come (unless I break this, hopefully not).Finally thanks to all the previous 5-star reviewers here at Amazon. They've done really a good job giving this phone with it deserves.",18,5
Samsung,"If you are on the fence about purchasing the?ÿSamsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White, rest assured that you will be getting what I dear say is the most advanced phone/tablet on the market to date. What are the features of this phone? What can it do? It may actually be easier to tell you what it can't do.I've had lots of different makes and models of cell phones over the years, including Blackberry and Iphone but I dear say that this is by far the best phone that I've ever owned, it has way more features than I may ever actually use. The Samsung Galaxy Note II makes the great Iphone seem very BORING in comparison.This being the international version, I initially had a little trouble with getting Apps from the Samsung Apps Store, every time I tried I got an Error Message that was basically stating that the Samsung Apps was registered in one Country and my Samsung account was from another country so I was unable to get any Apps for the Samsung Apps Store. (If you are having the same problem, just let me know and I'll help you fix the issue).The level of customization on this phone is simply amazing, I know that you will happy with this purchase, unless you have an issue with the size, let's face facts this is a big phone but it is by far the best out there, a total beast when it comes to processing power.P.S. I must make mention of this just to let you know happened when I made my purchase so you can take precaution when making yours.I purchased my Samsung Galaxy Note II form a seller known as ""Techno.Trading.House"" but was fulfilled by Amazon. When I received the package, there were no seals on the box, there should be a seal on each side, it should also have a plastic film on the screen as well as the back of the phone, but the one on the back was missing and there was minor scratches on the back of the phone.When I took the plastic film off of the screen there were finger prints all over and the battery was not in a plastic bag as it was supposed to be, taking all of these things into consideration, it lead me to believe that someone opened this box and placed the battery into the phone probably out of curiosity, whatever the reason, someone clearly TAMPERED with my phone scratching the back cover in the process.When I checked the log it showed that the phone was in use for over 5.5 minutes, apart from this, the phone seems to be in perfect working condition with no scratches on the screen whatsoever.My advice to you is to purchase from Amazon or from a seller whose product is fulfilled by Amazon in order for you to be covered by Amazon.When Amazon heard of my issue, they apologized for what happened and told me that products from other sellers that are fulfilled by them is from the sellers stock, and they promptly offered me a full refund so I can re-order, which I thought was great on their part, Amazon always like to see their customer be happy with their purchase.I told Amazon that I don't think that a full refund was necessary in this case as the phone works great otherwise so they offered my a 20% refund for the condition in which I received the phone, this I accepted as I consider this fair for all.PLEASE be careful who you purchase from, these phones are not cheap in any way, if you were to look at ""Techno.Trading.House"" seller's profile & feedback rating you will see mostly 5 star ratings which may give a false sense of security, make sure that your purchase is covered by Amazon for your peace of mind.",279,5
Samsung,"I wanted to get the phone unlocked for obvious reasons, but there are a few things I didn't know. For one, it doesn't come with US hardware, like the USB charger is a European model. There is no warranty either, I contact Amazon, they told me to contact where I got it, I think they said World Wide dist., they were short and terse with me. They couldn't tell me how I can register this phone. What's worse is that Samsung doesn't support it either - they made the phone. You can't ask questions because the number n7100 isn't a choice. So that's a big problem right there.I installed a Sandisk class 10 64gb micro sd card, it had the android on the cover. The phone knows it's there, yet there is no install to SD option anywhere on the phone, and most programs don't know from it. Some know it's there, some don't, some backup programs know it's there and can use it. But for the most part it's useless, and I can't find anyone in Samsung that will answer that simple question. I don't want to root the phone, because I don't want to take the chance messing it up. I'm hoping it's a glitch, 4.1.2 is rumored to come out at the end of January, maybe that will be fixed by then.That's why it's a 3.However that aside, it's a great phone. Fast, GPS locks on in seconds (though a little too often since it writes home to google each time you connect). Plenty of apps to get. I found it odd that even though I'm plugged into the USB, that the battery will drain. And the computer won't sync up with it, instead I have to rely on the wifi working.The pen feature is kind of dumb. Mostly it's the software, Samsung made the software and it doesn't flow like the system does. Like you can't drag and drop a file, you have to select by holding down, then move, then click the folder, then select move again, it's kind of tedious. The pen is also really hard to hold onto and that button is a joke, unless you have tiny hands.The size of the thing is rather large, and it's very slippery. Even with a case on it, it slid out of my pocket twice. If you plan on putting it in your pocket, and I place the glass side against my leg, choose a case that is sticky. When the otter box comes here and if it's less then retail I'll buy that. The instructions are terrible though it does come with a help app. The instructions that came with the phone was in 5 languages but not English, but you can download the full version online anyway, and the booklet was mostly for that pen.Everything about the phone is google oriented, and while I'm not totally certain, I think my search results for a map ended up in the google now that's installed. The talking features of the phone work well, they understand most things what I say, I just wish I could teach it my name. The spoken by it works well. The map functions is more than great because you can download 10 miles at a time, though the resolution drops the further away you get. But the maps are huge. But when offline you can browse these as if you were online and get spoken turn by turn instructions. If your online you can choose other routes to avoid traffic. There is a siri like thing on this device that I have yet to figure out. So far everything I asked has been totally ignored. Frankly I don't know what it's even for. I guess it's another gimmick to compete with apple.Graphics are fantastic, bold bright and pretty even. Strong contrast, you'll lose a little detail in the shadows, but everything else looks wonderful. There is a built in updater that will check and install any updates you programs might need. The info is in the notification box. The flash for the camera is a LED, pretty bright and can be used as a flashlight, so that's pretty neat. Oh you might want to get a better USB, I find that it's too short and seems to always pull out, along with that - you'll need the charger for your outlet, if you don't already have one.",11,3
Samsung,The galaxy note 2 has to be the best phone every created. I love being able to use the multitasking sucks though that not alot of apps support that function yet though. The battery life is amazing and can take my heavy pounding all day long. The fast charging is no joke its fast. The s pen function that is supposed to beep and vibrant when you leave the pen out and walk away does not work well at all though. The phone can run a littke hot because its a quad core but that's not also a big deal breaker. There is a led light on the top left of the device so you will know when you have a notification. I am not going to root this phone it does not need it like all other phones.,42,5
Samsung,"First,I purchased this phone through Amazon but it was just fulfilled by them so I will not lower the rating cause I received an open box item that was already used cause it's NOT the products fault! I did end up ordering through a different venue and am VERY glad that I have this phone now... It is screaming fast and begs for attention from everyone... This is the fastest and smoothest phone I have ever owned and I am a phone junky!! I really like that they made ALL of the US variants with the same internals as well cause now we have sooo many choices and don't have to sacrifice the hardware because of the networks we are tied to... ( Galaxy S3 ) ;) I actually wanted the International version cause it will get timely updates unlike our garbage US providers that deliver updates whenever they get around to it... I am sick of being tied to a carrier that won't let Android be ANDROID! ( Verizon ) ;) Anyways, there is not really much to say about this phone... It's a BEAST!! Nuff said!!",23,5
Samsung,"The Galaxy Note 2 is an amazing piece of technology. I'm writing this review to shed light on a Company 'FGS Trading"" whom of which i bought this phone from on here. I ordered the phone on Monday. I live in GA and made it a blunt point i needed the phone by friday. Knowing this i emailed them immediately after buying this and told them if there was anything i needed to do as far as pay more for shipping or change the address to my home where i live (instead of where i had it sent to at my parents house since i'm visiting for the holidays) to just let me know and don;t ship it until then. They shipped it anyways then proceeded to lie to me and tell me it shipped Monday and would be here Wednesday. In reality, it didn't ship Monday. It sat there overnight even though i payed for the phone before 1 p.m on Monday. Tried emailing them about this and there is less than ZERO accountability by any person there. Basically told me it was my fault even though I asked them in multiple emails to let me know if anything needed to be done to guarantee it would be here before the weekend and on top of all of that i was lied to. BEWARE OF THIS SELLER! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM! I have copies of all the emails sent i will be sending to Amazon and on Forums to make sure this company pays for its lies, deception, and massive inconvenience they have created for me.",13,3
Samsung,"Absolutely love this phone. It runs on Android 4.0. If you read anywhere that it's on an older Android version, that information is outdated. This phone has now been upgraded to 4.0, and if you buy it, it'll come with 4.0 already installed. I bought this phone after having an Android 1.5 phone for too long.The Galaxy S Blaze 4G came out about a year ago, but I don't think it'll become dated anytime too soon. It's basically the same as the Samsung Galaxy S2, with a few minor things missing (like HDMI port). So, if you want a phone from the Galaxy family, and don't want to pay too much, I strongly recommend this one. Plus, Tmobile is currently installing an LTE network, so I don't think it makes much sense to pay a lot of money for the Galaxy S3 which is on HSPA+. The Galaxy S Blaze 4G is on HSPA+, but it's cheaper, and a great phone to have until LTE is fully up and running, IMO. I don't do too many crazy things with this phone, but this phone has everything most people use smartphones for.I love the size, it's about the size of an iPhone. It might be marginally smaller than the Galaxy S2. So, if you're looking for something about as big as the iPhone or S2 (as opposed to the giant S3 and S4), this is your phone.",13,5

Samsung,"the reason i choose this rating it's because i order two phones samsung duos both white color and not only one of the phones came in a different color; the other phone came with the menu button loose or damaged, needless to say why i choose this rate and then i called the seller to let them know about it, they told me that i should send the phone back first and then they would refund my money, so i definitely would NOT recommend this seller under any circumstances.",12,1
Samsung,I find it to be very slow. It is causing me to miss calls and special on the spur photo moments.The battery life is very poor. I had to replace my battery in less that a month.,26,1
Samsung,"version is the 7562L, works well in Venezuela, MOVILNET, MOVISTAR and should work well for digitel. updated version of the software, connect it to the PC right from the start without problems. personally I'm using to MOVILNET, the connection is slow, for MOVISTAR is faster.Sometimes the phone is slow when turning or especially when communicating with BBM or facebook messeger.Anyway, the phone is good, unlocked, and cheap compared to the mini S3.I hope you have served my opinion on this device",23,5
Samsung,"The phone is very very slow. I dont like, the performance is like 90s phone. Double chip work ok. Bye",13,2
Samsung,"battery lasts roughly 35-40hrs with over 10hrs of talk time, great camera, sensitive touch screen, might need just a tad bit more processing power",22,5
Samsung,I bought this phone not once but 2 times and still was a piece of junk. First time I ordered it the mouth piece was broke you could see it moving around. The they sent me another one and the screen was coming off. Never had such a problem with Samsung before. Very dissappointed.,20,1
Samsung,"I received the phone in apparently good conditions, but after 2 hours of being used, no calls, no internet, only looking at the functions, it got blacked-screen. I thought that happened because it needed to be charged, so I left it charging but nothing happeded. It turns on, but you can't see nothing but a slight green-yellow line. I talked to a Samsung technician and he told me it was the screen, and for a ""new"" phone, it's weird that the screen gets wrong so easy without a crash or a fall, so he thinks this cell phone is refurbished.I would like to know what the seller has to say about this, cause I supposedly bought a new product. If I get it repaired, the screen will be more expensive than the phone, cause here in Venezuela we have an exchange control. I bought the phone for $204, and the screen price here in Venezuela is about $270.",17,1
Samsung,"This replaced my LG Optimus & what an upgrade! The android version I went from was 2.0 to 4.0. The white is beautiful and the size is awesome without being too heavy. All apps load quickly & many can run at same time. Would recommend for anyone who wants to use as phone, mp3 player, mini-computer. It does it all. I listen to music at work. I keep it plugged in to power so it doesn't drain battery & use ear plugs so I can have it as loud as I'd like it without disturbing anyone in my office area. Love it very much!",10,5
Samsung,This phone is awesome ... all the bells and whistles. Beautiful display and very fast. I would recommend this phone to anyone :),17,5
Samsung,"If you are a Virgin Mobile customer, (or thinking about it) and can fit this into your budget get this phone. I've been a V.M. customer for about a year and decided to upgrade my phone so I got for this phone. It has a great screen size, it's fast and I had heard good things about the Samsung Galaxy. The price from Amazon is better than any place else so, I went for it.I ordered it on a Friday afternoon and paid a little extra for Sat. delivery, I wanted to do the setup and activation over the weekend.The activation went smooth and then Sunday I just happened to do a web search (not on V.M. yet) about an updates ""Virgin Mobile Galaxy II updates"" and found that Samsung has an update (for this phone) to Jellybean 4.1.2. You can't beat that for good timing.A little tip about the update: You do need to restart your computer for the drivers to work. IE Download, extract and install, then restart and run.Thanks Sir Richard expect my call ;-)",10,5
Samsung,"The phone worked great for 2 days and then became plagued by ERROR 67, meaning that it could not access data (internet, e-mail, facebook, etc.). I patiently went through three days of customer service calls to the ""support"" department of Virgin Mobile only to be told each time that the problem would be ""escalated"" the the appropriate technical department and would be fixed in 24 hours. For three successive days, I did this dance without resolution. Each time I called they would tell me that there was no record of my previous call or notation that the service request had been ""escalated."" I asked each time for a reference # or case number to follow up, but they said that they simply did not do this. On the 4th call, I was finally told that the problem would take between 24 hours and 6 DAYS to address.The final kick in the teeth was when I finally became fed up enough to switch to a different carrier, Virgin Mobile would not cancel my account... again promising to ""escalate"" the request for cancellation. And because they have not complied with the porting regulations, texts that should go to the new service, have kept going to the Virgin phone. Calling their service ""incompetent"" is generous. They can do nothing but ""escalate"" to a mythological technical team.",10,1
Samsung,"So a couple of weeks ago, I finally got fed-up with my old phone (the HTC EVO V 4G). It was laggy, the battery life was dreadful, and the camera on it--even though it was a 3D camera and claimed to be ""high quality""--sucked. Heck, ONE scratch on the lens part of the camera made it so the flash function added a greenish hue to every picture I took; I could basically not use my flash. Just imagine my frustration, especially considering this happened just a couple of months after owning it.What sucks is...when I bought this phone, the white, standard version of it was sold out, so I was forced to purchase the titanium version of it. Aside from the color, they're the exact same phone. Not too big of an issue, I guess.After having the Galaxy S2 for a bit, I can honestly say that this is the best phone I've ever owned(inb4 ""iPhones are the bestest!!1!"") No, they are not. I own the latest generations of iPad and iPod Touch and I can honestly say that I hate the iOS platform with the burning, fiery passion of a thousand suns. But that's a conversation for another time.I've owned several phones while being a member of Virgin Mobile - The Samsung Intercept, Motorola Triumph, Kyocera Rise, HTC EVO V, and now the Samsung Galaxy S2.Since I've had it, not once have I had an issue with the battery draining rapidly, the screen ALWAYS moves as quickly as I swipe it with no input lag. This thing is basically--as numerous reviews I've seen say--a mini supercomputer. Plus since Jelly Bean is now out for the Virgin Mobile of the Galaxy S2, the phone is even better than it was before. What more could I ask for, aside from it turning into a Transformer and assisting me in taking over Earth?I would definitely HIGHLY recommend this phone to those who are looking to purchase, especially if you're as tired as I was of scouring all over the place for the perfect Virgin Mobile phone.",37,5
Samsung,"I changed to this phone from the Motorola Triumph and it was a good choice. The triumph is a great phone, but this phone is superior in many ways. The screen's resolution shows more vibrant colors and the phone's processor is quite faster. Also, the picture quality is much higher on my new phone ( takes pictures as well as my actual camera!). The battery life is also about three times longer, which comes in handy when I'm away from the house all day. Overall, the phone is easy to use and worth the cost in the long run.",34,5
Samsung,"FAST SHIPPER. Good Price. Item was as described well package as it was brand new in box. Got it fast!Why live with a contract? Went to Verizon thinking why is everyone going with a plan; there must be some benefit to it?!After my discounted Verizon phone broke after light use in the first 2 months and Verizon wanting me to purchase another phone at full retail price, even there discounted/re-certified phones where way over $300!! ""is there nothing you can do for me? You guys are my carrier now and this phone is only couple months old??"", I said. ""there is a Blackberry Curve re-certified for only $325."" Verizon replies. ""Ok I had that same phone on Virgin Mobile (VM) that I bought for 1/3 the cost you are charging, brand new and its only a 3G phone if I wanted that I would of stayed on VM and paid 1/3 of the bill also (plus your data is capped now), and did you say ONLY $325??."" ... Long story shortI then saw Virgin Mobile had Dual Core and 4G phones! Bye Verizon you can take your 78/month, 88/month, 98/month and finally 108/month?? The one thing you know is fact, your monthly will always go up with a contract. And if you don't have insurance on your phone you will be paying as much as a non-contract phone.I had VM for 8 years and left them for 4 months and learned a valuable lesson, there is no benefit to going with a contract carrier. If anything there is more a reason not to go with a contract.",13,5

Samsung,"To start off, I was confused with which phone to buy! S2, S3, S4 all are in the market!! But I went by a strict budget that I had in mind $300 and believe me the phone is more than worth it.The only thing that you need to be very careful about is S2 and S2 plus. The S2 plus has number 9105 while S2 has the number 9100. S2 plus has a few minor enhancements as compared to S2 the major one being the OS Android 2.3 vs. Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean).One thing you need to keep in mind there hardly are any feature differences between S2 plus, S3 and S4 that i will be using and hence it tilted my decision in favour of S2 plus.NOTE : BEWARE S2 (with old OS) costs more and is sold on this same site. I was about to buy it, but then realized that Samsung has released S2 plus with the latest OS!",14,5
Samsung,I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket from Bytes of Deals. WARNING: Chances of product being refurbished and sold as new are very high for the following reasons:1. Box is not what is expected or shown on the product pics - the colourful box with pics and logo of the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket on it. Instead box is a simple generic black box with Samsung logo alone! I know the difference because I purchased the same phone months before and it came in the proper box.2. There is no manual in the box!3. The headphones are not the standard Samsung headphones!4. Phone appears to be reset as it does not guide you through the initial phone start up as I had received when I bought the same phone months before.All evidences seem to show that this phone was reset and then re-packaged in a generic box with no manual and no original Samsung headphone!ADDITIONALLY: The Amazon seller - Bytes of Deal's storefront is closed and attempts to contact them are futile. Smells fishy and like a scam. I only hope Amazon is not a part of this!,43,2

Samsung,"My first Android phone was a Samsung Captivate which I really enjoyed despite the three major flaws: poor battery life, under-powered processor and limited RAM (i.e. freezing and lagging) as well as limited storage. In comparison to the Samsung Captivate, the Samsung Skyrocket has a much bigger screen but feels lighter, has a more than capable processor as well as sufficient RAM (hence the phone never freezes or lags), it has greater battery capacity, and I can use a 32GB MicroSDHC card. I use a Diztronic Matte Back Clear Flexible TPU Case made for the Skyrocket (available on Amazon). Most people mistake the phone for the Galaxy S III. The two complaints I have about the phone: 1) the screen can run hot and 2) battery life is not stellar if you are actively using your cell or wi-fi signals. I would recommend definitely recommend this phone to mid-range to high end users, especially if the price is right. In addition, this phone was also easy to ""root.""",27,4
Samsung,"Do not buy from Joycells. I wondered why they immediately send out an email telling you not to leave negative feedback. Now I know. Because they sell crap. The description of the phone says it is white. It is black. They put a sticker over the original pkg SN with a different description. The battery was generic, not samsung. The charger had scratches on it. The quick start guide looked like it was photocopied. The battery life was only about 6 hours even with NO use. I removed apps, reduced power, etc. I have done all the usual suggestions to make it better and it still had a terrible battery time. I am a very light user. I don't play games, look at videos or use it for music. I just make a couple calls a day and texts. It periodically shut off for no apparent reason and I did not know it til I tried to make a call. It periodically would not recognize my SIM card and I had to reboot. Sometimes the people I called could not hear me, nor could I hear them, although the phone said it was connected. I contacted the lousy customer service at Joycells and their answer was for me to return the phone and order another one. That would leave me without a phone for an indefinite period of time. That was their answer... take it or leave it. I ordered one from EBay. Works fantastic.... I have no problem with Amazon. Their customer service was good. They refunded my money.",23,1

Samsung,"This superb phone with many features and being a techie, I have fully tested this phone. Since this phone has EXCEEDED all of my expectations, here is my very detailed review of this very special and fun to use Skyrocket S2 phone. Although I paid more to purchase this phone NEW, I am very glad that I did so as it is working wonderfully! My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:- SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me (with a 4.5"" viewing screen like the S3 has). For me, I keep this phone inside a case and cover and it still fits easily into a rather small purse. And also I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music when I work out. Since the phone is lightweight, it is easy to wear on my waistband (in the storage case).- Unlocked Sim - Yes, the phone I received is NEW and I tested the Sim slot to make sure it was unlocked. First I inserted my neighbors T-Mobile standard Sim card (she has a pre-paid plan with no data plan). I simply popped it into the phone and it worked right out of the box, called someone and it worked great. Sent a text (with no pictures or attachments, just text and went fine). Then I removed her Sim and placed my own AT&T Activated Sim card (Standard sized card). With the T-Mobile and AT&T Sim cards, this phone worked perfectly as the phone is SIM UNLOCKED, the basic AT&T Logo is still there, the original AT&T Apps still there. But you can use say T-Mobile, Straight Talk, or MOST GSM Sim cards should work just fine--just make sure you buy the UNLOCKED ONE not the locked to AT&T one.However, if you want to use anything other than AT&T, please contact me in comments for the APN settings for Data and MMS as I have all the settings.One more thing if it says UNLOCKED rather than International Unlocked, it means that JUST THE SIM CARD SLOT is Unlocked for most GSM Standard Sized Sim Cards but still shows the AT&T Logo on the top front of the phone. Since I did not do anything on my neighbors Sim card but make a quick call and try it for about 30 minutes (she is thinking about buying this phone for herself and using T-Mobile as she does not an AT&T Account). Also, if you use WiFi like I do, no need for data unless you are in an out of WiFi area a lot of the time. For me, I am around WiFi 95 to 99 percent of the time!- LARGE SCREEN WITH GOOD RESOLUTION - This absolutely gorgeous screen measures 4.5 inches (seems larger) and it is just the right sized screen. Before this phone I used to use a Galaxy Note and Grand (both had 5 inch or more screens), both were too big, heavy and bulky. Now, I am using the S2 Skyrocket as the screen is large and has good resolution with 207 ppi (pixels per inch) and higher is better. This has a very sharp screen with easy to read screen. It looks to me as sharp as my old Galaxy Note I did and MUCH MUCH sharper than my Galaxy Grand (which just had 187 ppi and it was not as clear as the S2 Skyrocket) so that extra 20 pixels per inch makes a big difference in my opinion. Again, this screen is so vivid and clear!- STANDARD REGULAR SIZE SIM CARD: This phone has a regular/standard Sim card slot. (Note the S3 regular phone and S4 phones accept a micro Sim. So glad that this phone accepts a regular/standard Sim.-- Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.- WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser).- Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.- BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the ONE OF THE BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.- INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 16GB of Internal space. The 16GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 10.75GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.- CAMERA - The 8MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. Turns out to be a very good camera.- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.- OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. For me, I use an OTG Micro Adapter (S3 and S4 ones work) and am able to plug in a flash drive, mouse and more. Could not get my portable Hard Disk to work, but flash drives work fine.- NFC (Near Field Communication) has been advertised to work on this phone. Have not yet tried this feature.CONS:- No built in FM Radio like the regular SII has. Not a problem because I installed TuneIn Radio (free) from the Playstore and I can play lots of radio (FM or other) when WiFi is on.- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.",18,5
Samsung,"Would have given this a 5 stars review but it did not come with the 2 batteries shown in the picture. It was in new condition and came with the ear buds shown, plus 3 different sizes in end caps which was nice. I have T-Mo service so I just popped in my SIM card from my old phone and this new one was good to go. Also, this does not come with a manual, just a ""quick start"" guide and a ""safety and warranty"" booklet. It is an ATT unlocked phone so it is preloaded with a bunch of ATT junk that I'm still trying to uninstall. Otherwise this was an excellent buy that I would not hesitate to recommend.....just don't be fooled in thinking you will receive an extra battery like the pic shows. It does come with a USB power cord and A/C adapter plug and one pre-charged battery. The 4G capability of the Skyrocket v. just the Galaxy II is a real plus.",18,4
Samsung,"It is a brand new and unlocked AT&T Samsung Galaxy S II i77 as described by the seller Surge Telecom with all necessary accessories. The phone took H+ Digicel Haiti network fresh out the box, very fast phone with a dual core 1.2 Ghz processor, 1GB ram and 16 GB internal memory with dual camera of 8 and 2 MP. I read other reviews on the internet saying that network selection mode was locked in the rom by AT&T but on mine i can select network manually but FM radio has been disabled in the ROM by AT&T but there are a lot of apps on the android market available for local and online radio stations. The battery is the worst thing of the phone as every smart phones today. This is one of the best smart phone out there if it is not the best, outshine the iphone in term of performance but the iphone has a better battery and a good built quality comparing to the galaxy S II, Which is a plastic phone but has to be due to size and weight. I left Blackberry 9900 for it, i am a big fan of apple products and owe lots of but decided to try this one instead of getting an iphone and i can tell you this is the best choice, for me this is the best phone out now. Hope that AT7T enables radio FM and come out the ICS update for the phone in the coming days.",18,4
Samsung,"the phone it self was excellent, but when i try to charge it, it wouldn't. i tried how many times, and it still wouldnt charge.",18,1
Samsung,"I'm a big fan of the GALAXY'S! Anyways this phone is great, its 4.5 inch screen is perfect to watch videos or movies. The camera quality is great and also the front camera quality is good. It also records videos in HD. I love this phone because its very fast and it doesn't slow down if I have various apps running at the same time. Only problem I had was that the phone wasn't unlocked when I received it. I called my seller and they kindly provided the unlock code. If your buying this phone buy it from WIRELESS EXPERTS they have good customer service.",15,4
Samsung,"I bought this ""unlocked galaxy S II cell phone"". First of all it didn't come unlocked, it took 4 days to solve the problem.Now the cell doesn't charge when I plug it nor connects via USB.I went to a Samsung dealer and the result was that the main board contains sulfates (it happens when you got your cell phone wet, the humidity and the electricity create sulfates, that's what they told me I am not an expert). Of course I didn't put the cell phone on water!!!! I am not sure if I received a brand new galaxy s II.Completely disappointed of the galaxy I received.In the other side, I was an iphone user for the last 4 years. What I have seen of the galaxy is amazing, most of the apps I paid for in the appstore are free in the android market, it is bigger in area, but slimmer and lighter.I hope I can solve the issue and enjoy the galaxy.I will write more to tell you how it ends.",16,1
Samsung,"First, The phone came before the estimated time of arrival, wonderful! I normally don't like buying refurbished or used phones but I was in need of a new phone and the price was too good to resist. The phone came in its original box and upon opening it the phone was fully intact, all stickers on the screen and back door, brand new! Usb, charger and headphones included! Unfortunately, The battery seems to not charge all the way to 100% but I just got it so I'm working on that and I hope I can get that fixed....Also, It says tmobile and I have tmobile unfortunately my SIM card was too big to fit so I had to cut it down to fit...i guess tmobile sim chips range in size....I'm just hoping I'm able to fix the battery life(battery life is important since I use my phone for everything, that's why I gave it 3 stars)..other than that the phone works and looks good....bought refurbished from Apex Trading....",10,3
Samsung,"If you are not patient enough, this review is about online seller Wireless Experts Inc., who sold me a new ""factory unlocked"" Samsung Galaxy S3 that is reported as stolen 5 months after purchase. It cost me 3 Months (and counting) to contacting multiple sources including the Seller, Samsung, AT&T, and T-Mobile, dozens of email conversations, time and energy trying to return a defective item to the Seller that I didn't know it was defective until 5 Months later this phone doesn't register to network at all. If you are patient enough, please read on. I think it would be beneficial for inexperienced online shoppers looking for unlocked smartphone. I sincerely hope they won't make the same mistake I have made.Last November I purchased an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S3 T999 from Wireless Experts Inc. on Amazon, at $564. Seller said this phone is unlocked and works with GSM carriers.That phone was shipped to me with nice factory packaging, and it was working as expected. However 5 Months later, on May 5th, it can't register to network anymore. I tried everything I could but somehow my SIM card works on other GSM phones but their card won't work on mine phone. I contacted seller and they told me it has passed 90 days and there is no way I could return it to them. Seller suggested I contact Samsung for solution. Samsung replied and agreed to repair my phone. I shipped this S3 to Samsung in TX and they diagnosed and changed parts related to signal reception, and shipped the phone back to me.After putting my SIM card back and switched it on, this phone still not register to network.My friend told me my phone may be blacklisted by carrier. I submitted IMEI number to T-Mobile, and T-Mobile says this phone was reported lost and blocked from registering networks.Here comes the email communications, counts up to 43, summarized as follows:1. I contacted Wireless Experts Inc. that this phone was reported stolen. I want to return this phone to them and get my money back.2. Seller said it still may work with AT&T and asked me to try an AT&T SIM card.3. I insist it was seller's fault to sell me a stolen phone that is blocked by carrier 5 Months later.4. Seller said a stolen phone is USUALLY reported lost in 90 DAYS, 5 MONTHS seems ABNORMALLY LONG to him.5. I said REALLY I didn't knowing this phone was defective, or I would definitely return it in that so called 90 DAYS.6. Seller said he would ask his supervisor.7. After long waiting, the Seller said he will refund me $200 for returning this item to him, after 3 months contacting him.SUMMARY and LESSON LEARNED:1. Checking IMEI after you bought an unlocked smartphone won't work since it might be reported after months of usage.2. Even if you received a factory sealed new phone, looks just from ""factory"" rather than another person, it still might be reported as stolen.****UPDATE on Aug 9th, 2013****This long lasting case was closed, when seller agreed to 1. refund $200 for this phone WHILE I can keep it, in addiction, 2. refund $400 AND return this phone to him if it doesn't work with other carriers that haven't banned this phone yet. Both parties are OK with this result.",63,1
Samsung,"This phone only lasted 3 months. Maybe only a few weeks after receiving it, it started having charging issues. It would not hold a charge and took forever to charge up. Eventually, it stopped charging completely and wouldn't turn on anymore. Also, when I uploaded it to my Verizon account and activated it, it came up as an ""Amber Brown"" phone despite being white. So when I had to get it replaced by insurance, both Verizon and Asurion would not replace it with a white phone because the code in the phone is for an Amber Brown one. Do not order from this seller.",10,1
Samsung,"Great small phone!I'm apparently the last man on earth who thinks a phone should fit in your pocket, and primarily serve as a phone. Yes, I love the smartphone features - email, video, websurfing, etc - but most of my life I'm easily within 10-20 feet of a real computer - with a real monitor and a real keyboard. And if I'm doing email it's way more efficient to do it on a real keyboard, web surfing is infinitely easier with a mouse and a 20"" monitor, and video is best seen on something properly sized. The difference between a 4"" screen and a 6"" screen for all is miniscule - it's like saying I prefer to use a 3/4"" garden hose to put the fire out instead of a 1/2"" hose - when there's a real firehose hooked up to a real hydrant right next to you....Meanwhile, aside from the size being perfect, this phone works great with my T-Mobile service. It also has an SD card slot, wihich I love for moving large files and pictures off the internal memory but the recent Android updates that prevent most apps from storing their data there limit that usability.I understand the issues preventing you from moving apps to external storage, but why would anyone in their right mind not allow a camera app or a podcast app to store it's data on external SD? That's just stupid, but that's out of our control.Meanwhile, battery life is good - but not great. It's a small battery so I understand. I get a day out of it and that's about it.If you're the type that thinks the difference in screen resolution between X and Y pixels is a make or break issue (which obviously means you put far too much importance into watching entertainment on a screen that is far too small for that...) I'm sorry but I can't either gush about the fantastic resolution or gripe about the low resolution - whatever it is. Cat videos look fine, as do pictures.I've used six or seven different phones now including a couple varieties of I-devices, and so far I like this one the best.",45,5
Samsung,"I purchased this phone for my wife and I have to say it is excellent. I have an iphone 5 and love it, but would recomment a samsung galaxy for people who want a great phone which is cheaper.",10,5

Samsung,This item was advertised as a NEW USA Samsung smartphone.What I got was a USED MEXICAN Samsung smartphone with a SPANISH User Manual.The box factory seals wear broken on both ends.I have photos to prove all the above!I want a $US 100 Goodwill CREDIT from AMAZON and this Vendor.,11,1
Samsung,"BUYER BEWARE! The factory seals on the box were broken and the seller attempted to cover them up with seals of their own. The phone, box, instructions, etc are in Spanish. This was not posted in the listing anywhere. While you can change the language once you are in the phone, there are things like the email signature line that are still in Spanish. I can't figure out how half the functions work on the phone without the English instructions. Also, the shipping was so slow, I could've walked to the state it was being shipped from faster than it took the postal carrier to get here. Huge disappointment.An update since my original post: I contacted Samsung for help. This model DOES NOT EXIST...IT IS NOT A SAMSUNG PHONE! IT IS FAKE!",11,1
Samsung,This is the smaller version of the Ssmsung sIII. It fits smaller hands perfectly.The screen size is larger then the Apple iPhone.,11,5
Samsung,"After having it for a week now I definitely got a good feel of the phone now. Out of the box I loved it!!! It was stylish, fast and pretty easy to use and set up. I loved how ez it was to customize everything. The phone is lightening fast running multiple apps seamlessly and for an average cell phone user it was more than enough to run tasks like light web browsing, media and messaging. There were some things I had a little problem with for example if your a big music person the stock music player doesn't have lock screen functions which is a BIG thing for me but winamp easily fixed that seamlessly syncing your playlists, etc from the stock android player. The stock messaging keyboard didn't have very good predictive text and it wasn't very good for typing long messages quickly so I ended up downloading swiftkey which is definitely worth it if you're a big texter and like typing quickly and accurately. The phone's internal memory itself comes out to be barely 4 gb compared to the 8 that was advertised and you aren't able to store apps onto the SD card which could be a bit of a problem if you're an app fanatic. But for personal files and media, expanding it with a 32gb sd card is no problem. The last issue I had with this phone was if you plan on using this phone without using mobile data, you won't be able to view multimedia messages using wifi because the s3 line requires you to download it through the carrier's network. All these were little hiccups in an otherwise amazing phone. You can't beat the features and design of the phone with the price. I would definitely recommend this phone in a heartbeat.",28,5
Samsung,I've bought this unlocked cell phone when I was in the states and now I am using this in my country here in Turkey. If you are looking for an inexpensive smart phone this is what you need...,22,5
Samsung,excellent product work well in venezuela. it is worth the price. recommended phone to frustrated iphone users that want to change phone,20,5

Samsung,"This is a truly unlocked international phone, the UI can be set to any language from the long list. It's sad and understandable why Samsung won't sell it in US as it is twice as cheaper than its big brother Galaxy S III. The screen is gorgeous, the phone is very fast and responsive. The size of this baby is perfect for both men and women, unless one prefers all those ""bricks"" with huge screens. I love this phone!",106,5
Samsung,"el envio llego a tiempo el producto en perfecto estado , nuevo!!!... es totalmente desbloqueado , sirve perfectamente para movistar en venezuela",86,5
Samsung,"I researched this product and looked forward to receiving it. I even paid a fee for fast delivery. However, the seller, SurgeTelecom, sent the same model number but with an ""L"" at the end of the model number. The ""L"" means the telephone is configured for Latin America and it is NOT the telephone I ordered. I tried to use the phone in the U.S. but its speed never went over EDGE or H because the phone is not configured for the U.S.Even though the phone I received has the same model number as this phone EXCEPT FOR THE ""L"" AT THE END, the ""L"" model phone is quite different. As I wrote, it is configured for Latin America. The box the telephone came in showed that the phone was manufactured in Vietnam and most of the writing on the box is in Spanish. Worse, however, is the fact that the phone with the ""L"" requires a mini SIM card while this model requires a standard SIM. That makes a huge difference.I will be ordering again and hopefully, a different seller will not substitute my order with a phone that is configured for a totally different geographic area.A friend has this phone (the one I ordered, but not the wrong one I received from the seller, SurgeTelecom. The phone is great and is perfect for my needs.UPDATE -I returned the wrong phone that I received (discussed above). I then ordered a replacement phone and, INCREDIBLY, I received another phone with the ""L"" after the model number and the wrong size SIM card. This makes two separate times I received the wrong phone within one month. Be careful when ordering. Even though the model number you receive is correct, if the model number has an ""L"" after it, the phone will not work properly in the U.S.Doesn't anyone bother to check items before they are shipped?",52,1
Samsung,"I've heard a lot of back and forth reviews on this. I love this phone. I live in the U.S. and i have consumer cellular as my phone provider. I bought this phone, stuck my sim card in it, and had no trouble at all setting it up. All i had to do was go through initial set up steps like language settings (it was in English (ireland) and i changed it to english (united states)). Connected to our WIFI and the WIFI at my work without any problems...this phone amazes me with what it can do in a phone that's not overly bulky. My brother got one of these as well and i set it up exactly like mine without a single problem.",52,5
Samsung,"Samsung did it again great product. This phone is about the same size as the iphone 5, but i like it more.",38,5
Samsung,I am so confused why this phone is not more popular. I had a normal Samsung SIII which I promptly lost due to its ginormous size (can't fit in any damn pockets). This little guy fits so nice in my tiny lady pockets and honestly I can barely notice a difference in processing prowess. Don't forget it takes a full size sim card unlike the SIII normal.,31,5
Samsung,This phone came unlocked as I hope and all and all I am very please ^_^I am using this phone with net10 working off of the ATT network. $54 unlimited monthly plan...good bye Verizon better than paying $90!! OH and yes I have 3G/4G speeds coverage is excellent very very satisfied.,12,5
Samsung,"I love this smartphone, it has the optimal size, not too big as the SIII and not small as others smartphones.The dual core CPU gives the correct performance and speed to this phone.I must really say that I'm impressed with the touchscreen, sensitive and smooth.I bought the International version, sold by Amazon due I read some ""1star"" comments of different buyers; like users received an used phone, with logos of AT&T or others. This one, sold by Amazon is almost USD 40 more expensive but you'll receive what you want. A new phone, unused, without logos.The only thing I need to mention is when you turn on at first time, the Languge is in Hungarian (or something like that), I used google traductor to change it to Spanish, the one I need. So this is not a big matter, but I need to mention it.Until now, I am 100% satisfied with this phone. Hope this satisfaction last for a few years.",24,5
Samsung,"This phone fits very well on the palm of your hand. It runs so fast that you may think it is a quad core phone. Battery is good not great. You do not need a micro-SIM for this phone. The camera could be better but it takes good pictures considering it is a budget phone. If you want to purchase an unlocked phone that will not break your bank, this is a great choice.",17,4
Samsung,I was looking for a smart phone to upgrade to with out having to spend big bucks for the newest unlocked phones. Un talking like$ 500-$800. This is great for the price no problems hooking it up to my att prepaid service. Also I live in the US and worked fine. Very fast shipping and I cannot express how happy I am with this phone.,57,5
Samsung,"I love this phone!! It is easily the best phone I have ever owned. I came from the LG Optimus One (p500) and I love the candy bar style, but more I love having a dual processor, tons of storage, two cameras, LED flash, super AMOLED screen for reduced energy use and glare reduction, and the overall design of the electronics and user interface is great :) and so reasonably priced! I highly recommend this phone!! Plus it works very well with my existing T-mobile account so I was able to use my existing SIM and keep my number.",29,5
Samsung,Item was delivered on time and brand new. No problems so far. Great buy!,12,4
Samsung,"The only reason to buy this phone is if your current cel broke and for whatever reason you can't upgrade to a replacement, you can't get the insurance to get you a new one, or you don't want to drop hundreds of dollars on a brand new handset.Do yourself a favor and get something else. You might think you're getting a proper s3 but you're not. Here's why:1) Brutally slow processor. As in, every app takes a second to load, draw the screen, and let you start using it. That doesn't sound like a lot ('one second? how bad can that be?') but imagine if EVERYTHING you do makes the phone work... one... second...... slower......... every........ time............... you..................................... use ............................................... it.....................................................................................................................2) Reception is crap. It's a mini, so there's no real antenna. Like to use your phone to talk? Forget it. Crackly and dropped calls, always.3) All apps work for crap. Native, google apps (such as maps, the only reason to get an android anyway) hang up, crash, won't start, and run so slow as to be unusable. I used to have a G1 and this phone's navigation is slower than that.4) Crap battery life. Half a day... and yes, I turned off EVERY SINGLE NON NECESSARY APP to reduce battery drain. Half a day is all you get.One good point: after the phone navigation got me lost 3 times in half an hour (in a 20 block radius) I smashed it repeatedly on the steering wheel and it didn't break. But, since it's a hundred dollar paperweight I wished it HAD broken. So, even the good stuff is kind of bad.Don't get this phone. If you get it for your kids or your grandma, their friends will make fun of them for having such a slow, crappy phone. Don't let your grandma's friends make fun of your grandma!P.S I'm looking at the other 5 star reviews for this phone. 90% of them are one word reviews ('excelente'), and all from South America. Everyone I know from South America has an iphone, for realz. Also, no one is gonna bother to log into Amazon to write a one-word review for a product they like... so, astro-turfing. Don't get this phone.",18,1
Samsung,It already comes with a screen protector installed.,10,5
Samsung,"You'll need to buy a SIM card if you use Verizon. Sometimes it's better to buy this phone and just go to a corporate Verizon store and have them put the SIM card in when you get it activated. Chances are you'll have to go to that store to get the phone activated anyway.The phone I bought here on AMAZON didn't have the SIM card, just an empty slot.You'll want to buy a SD micro memory card if you don't have one already. I recommend at least 16 GB if not 32 GB. The phone I bought here on AMAZON didn't have the SD micro memory card, just an empty slot.This is a fairly bare bones purchase option. You're still going to want to buy an Otter Box Defender series (or equivalent) type case. You'll want either that or a silicone slip cover for it, and screen protector sheets. The phone is seriously thin, and tough for big guy hands to hang onto. You might want a stylus if you text a lot.You get the phone, a battery, a charger, a USB data cable, and that's about it. If you want the manual, go online to Verizon or to Samsung websites.I had the Samsung Galaxy S4 (next size up) and didn't like it because it is so big; I may as well carry a tablet or laptop. I have also had the Samsung Continuum (which is the very first Galaxy class). The Continuum is reminiscent of the banana phone early cell phones, and has an inadequate camera, plus a very small screen. The Samsung Galaxy S III is a great bridge between, the 8 megapixel main camera is far superior to the Continuum (5 megapixel), but not quite as benchmark as the Galaxy S4 which has a 13 megapixel main camera. The S III and S4 have front cameras for webcam style video communication (not much difference between the S III and S4 front cameras - 2 megapixel or less).I like the Samsung Galaxy S III and consider it to be easier to use than the Samsung Continuum, however, this AMAZON listing would have had happier customers who bought here, if AMAZON mentioned that purchasers still need to buy the SD micro memory chip and be prepared to get their own SIM chip for this phone.",81,4
Samsung,I purchased phone used. It arrived fast & in great condition. 100% functional.Have been using for over two months. Its the best phone I have owned yet. Hardly ever crashes or freezes and throughput speed is excellent. Works & connects even when signal is weak.,31,5
Samsung,I bought this phone to replace my daughter's that had been damaged. She previously had the Samsung Galaxy SIII and liked it so much that she wanted an exact replacement for it.,12,4
Samsung,"The phones worked great once I found a place to buy a Verizon sd card. When I first received the phones neither one of them would even do anything without the verizon card in the back of it. By the time I bought the phones and paid for the verizon cards, which you can not purchase at verizon I had spent over 500.00. The phones actually work great, but I wish I would have known about the missing Verizon card in the description of the phone.",28,4
Samsung,"I particularly like the feature that silences notification and calls during certain hours unless from specified people. Since my phone used to bing all night from random emails or being tagged or someone responding to a thread, I particularly love this feature!",15,5
Samsung,"My wife's Galaxy III phone recently died and was un-repairable. With our contract with Verizon being up in a few months, I just wanted to purchase an inexpensive replacement for her. The phone we purchased from ""Custom for All"" through Amazon was perfect. It looked better than new. There wasn't a single scratch on it. Took it to Verizon right away to get it set up and the Verizon technician was impressed at the quality for a used phone. The delivery time from ""Custom for all"" was also great! I would recommend them to anyone! Thanks!",16,5
Samsung,"I purchased this item through Amazon Prime from a company called ""Breed"" and it is not authentic. The sticker on the inside of the phone is something printed on a home printer (with poor print quality).I called Samsung customer service and the IMEI number was a legitimate one (the phone was made 11 months ago) but it was mysteriously out of warranty already. Next, I called AT&T and told them I had bought this new phone and would they be able to accept it. They looked up the IMEI number and it turns out that the phone had been through their liquidation department. The rep explained that this meant that the phone had been returned and it was considered defective. This explains why the phone no longer carries the 1-year warranty.I called Amazon customer support and they will give me a refund but they seemed very relaxed about the whole thing. They will not report this back to ""Breed"". I am outraged! I paid almost four hundred dollars and got a knock off or, at best, a refurb. I had stayed away from e-Bay because I did not want to get a phone that was not authentic. I put my trust in the Amazon Prime program. This phone was warehoused and shipped by Amazon on behalf of ""Breed"" which is a business name for a company called ""Unlocked Cell Phone Kings Inc.""I am so disappointed that Amazon Prime is not a brand that can be trusted any more. All fellow Amazon customers, beware!",160,1
Samsung,Brought phone to lower my phone bill and works perfectly. I was able to go to Straight Talk service and get unlimited use of text and data about half the price. Compared the phone to Iphone and has the same capabilities and similar apps. Great product for a change.,105,5
Samsung,"Firstly, I'd like to point out that this review is primarily regarding the product received from Tablet Distributors (a featured seller under this listing, posted as New condition). When the item arrived, it was immediately evident that I did not have in front of me the box in the photos. It's technically carrier packaging, but it's a generic box from AT&T, with no printed information on the outside pertaining to this specific phone. The phone inside was in near-perfect condition, save for two very small blemishes that I can't seem to remove from the screen. It may be worth noting that these imperfections were covered loosely by a misaligned factory screen protector with the usual ""don't text and drive"" slogan AT&T is known for. Also, while the charger and battery door (and the phone, itself) seem to be genuine Samsung products, the battery is not. This creates problems when one is trying to get the phone to charge consistently, or to maintain a full charge if you ever do get it to that point. I've since ordered a genuine Samsung dock and spare battery, which comes with a handy one-piece wall charger, instead of the AC adapter/woefully short USB cable combination that comes in the phone's box. This new battery and charger seem to have cured all of my problems with charging, which is definitely a relief for me. The phone itself has proper specifications, as far as I know, to prove it's the exact model that's advertised here. The screen is absolutely beautiful, I must say. HD YouTube videos look flawless, though I may be easy to impress in this respect. I've previously owned a Nokia N900 (lovely phone, broken USB port) and a Motorola Atrix 2. The S3 seems to have so much more potential than these other models. I'm using this phone with Straight Talk and without any trouble. I can't really speak as to whether it's truly unlocked or not, since I've yet to have trouble using AT&T-locked phones on this service which also uses the very same network and towers. I CAN say that it's probably wise to find out which network your prepaid SIM-based service operates on in order to give you the best chance of having the same signal quality available to you. It's also good to know that these phones are capable of wireless charging, with a few accessories you can purchase here on Amazon. This is something that interests me, as I'm a bit paranoid about microUSB ports nowadays.All in all, this seems to be a great phone with enough tech packed inside to keep it feeling current for some time.",92,4
Samsung,"This will be my third Unlocked Samsung Galaxy SIII. Upon receiving this phone I immediately notice it was packaged in an opened generic style box with sliding cover instead of the sealed lid covered box all original Samsung Galaxy SIII's come in. This was a immediate flag due to my previous phones came in unopened larger and fully detailed packaging. Upon opening the box the phone was not package like the company models; there was a generic sticker on the screen that said ""Don't Text & Drive."" Clearly not from the AT&T company. The phone and other items were also wrapped in resealable plastic covers. Though the phone looks to be authentic, I am left to believe this item is some after market copy, or back door promotion item. Even some of the pieces in side of the phone are different than the original modes, i.e. SD Card and SIM Card slots are designed differently. And the serial sticker looked as it was printed wrong and slightly cut off (Definitely not present on my previous S3's).I have only turned the phone on at this point and all seems to work fine. But at this point I am lead to believe that this item was sold to me as some cheap copy with the authentic price tag. I am going to open the phone and if it does not have the Snap Dragon processing hardware, than this will definitely be a rip off! FOR SHAME!",62,2
Samsung,"After taking longer than advertised to arrive, I found out that it is not actually unlocked. It is at AT&T phone, that will not connect with my T-Mobile network. I am able to put my SIM card in to make calls, but unable to use any smartphone features. Can't even connect to wifi.",54,1
Samsung,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AS NEW BUT RECEIVED A REFURBISHED PHONE WHICH DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE ORIGINAL SAMSUNG BATTERY IN IT OR EVEN THE BOOKLET WHICH ALWAYS COMES WITH THE PACKAGE.

Samsung,"I concur with Mr. Love, a previous reviewer with basically similar experience.I ordered WHAT I EXPECTED TO BE NEW, my Samsung SIII 1747 white model. I set up the phone and immediately found that the phone was not taking charge fully. I figured the charger port may have had a fault so I purchased a charger docking system but to no avail. Witihn 10mins of use, the entire phone would turn hot to touch.Eventually, I carried my phone for technical review at a cellular phone company only to be notified that my phone was not an original model and that it was made up of all non-authentic parts.I still had to resort to purchase of a new Samsung SIII phone thats working perfectly.Lesson learned: take not of reviews (had I read Mr. Love's review prior, I don't think I would have bothered with this agency through which I purchased my phone)I hope those persons who are selling these faulty phones get whats coming to them!",44,1

Samsung,"This review describes my experience with this product and vendor, plus a little info I learned about shopping for unlocked phones.Pros: The phone works well; most of what I like is part of the product description and typical Samsung phone features - fast processor, huge clear screen, touch-screen that is more sensitive than my wife's iPhone 5s, super clear calls - receiver, and the speakerphone is best I've ever used for myself and callers AND there's a volume boost feature just for calls, 2 gb memory (opening tons of Chrome browser tabs at once without noticeable slowdown), 16gb storage (lots of music and apps), self-adapting brightness sensor, 8 mp camera, Jelly Bean (4.1.1) etc. The 4G LTE through my carrier is as almost as fast as my fiber optic internet line at 13mb down, 9 mb up. Netflix and Skype work very smoothly. Still a fan of Samsung's Swype keyboard, very accurate and it works great with a large screen space. I appreciate the Assistive Light widget, too. Still a few features I've yet to explore.Cons: Battery tends to run out quickly even though I'm actively using it about 3-4 hours a day. My usage is primarily from the display and browser/bandwidth hogging apps.Other comments: The thing about finding this particular item with this specific description (my original search was just for an unlocked Galaxy sIII) is the Amazon results only come up with one at any given time. The price seems to drop each day, and there's always a different vendor. Mine was ""Art Lobby"" - no major complaints, phone arrived on time, intact, mint condition. However, I found it strange that it was an AT&T phone with AT&T logo on the back cover of the phone and loaded with AT&T bloatware. After doing some research, I understand that the I747 model was sold by AT&T, so that makes sense.I also understand that while there's the ""Galaxy sIII"" there are different variations of the same phone, each with its own model number. The Wikipedia page describes the models and their differences in detail here: [...]Also, with some Samsung phones, be aware of the differences between the ""full"" models and the ""mini"" models. They're not the same phones, and this difference is poorly advertised by the company and a few carriers.What I learned/what I did: Do the research, deflate your mobile bill. My experience to look for an unlocked phone was driven by years of buying an overpriced, marked-up phone from my carrier whenever I changed my plan. Something to consider when buying an unlocked phone - make sure your phone and a particular model (see above on that I747 business) are compatible with your carrier. I did a ton of research before I made this purchase, and even as the price seems to drop every day, it was still worth paying $360 or so (just phone mind you, the talk/text & data plan with the carrier is separate) than $600+ over two years with my carrier for a phone that's been out for over a year. And that $600 is the phone only; when you do that, you either pay in full or pay so much down, followed by the 2 year monthly payments. Wish I had done this years ago - would've saved on my first smartphone and likely the phones before that back to 2003.A caveat here on the AT&T bloatware - I'm a tech, and rooted (i.e., gave myself administrator-level access) my phone in about 5 minutes as soon as I took it out of the box. It took a good 30 minutes overall to find and remove the bloatware, since I preferred not to do a full install of Android and further risk bricking my phone.",41,4
Samsung,"I ordered this phone on may 17 and was supposed to Arrive from the 21-24, it arrived on the 20th new product in safe condition and the best price on this article, I bought it from the seller US Wireless!But the low price is due that this phone does not come in the original box and seems the accessories that came with it are not authentic from Samsung. The USB cable seems and feels cheap although it says to be Samsung, The Battery's tag says to be a replacement battery for the Galaxy S3 I9300 and does NOT have the NFC chip (For S Beam and NFC wireless comunications). HUGE DEAL BREAKER IT DOES NOT COME WITH WARRANTY, but it works well its new no damage at all and it is in fact unlocked. Also no documentation of any kind, no user manual, no papers from At&t. Paying an extra 50 dollars and buying it from At&t directly or with Amazon's Wireless shop would be a good idea, that way you'd be getting your product completely sealed on the box.P.D. it comes with Android 4.1.1 not ICS **UPDATE**Day 2, since day two i noticed the wall adapter and USB cable didn't work properly. As soon as i connect the wall adapter to the electricity the phone starts ringing and notifying me that it needs to be charged. I had to use my old LG phone's USB cable and adapter. Although software and hardware work properly the Accessories and box are a total deal breaker. seriously i can only recommend this product if you do not care about these inconveniences. And if you prefer the authentic accessories and to take it right out the Samsung Box buy it from Amazon Wireless or other sellers who actually mention the imperfections. ** Final Upadate**Dont buy this Article buy it from Amazon or trusted sellers",34,2
Samsung,said it was new...it was not. but. it was fine for the price. not sure I'd get anything from blutek again though,24,3
Samsung,"Got this baby in the mail about two weeks ago and immediately began setting it up. There's not much inside the box, just the charger usb cord, small touchpen, micro sd chip/adapter combo and battery. (In the original order it had a docking charger and hip carrying pouch) Also should note that there was a generic replacement battery instead of the SAMSUNG one.Battery in, Excitement on - Or so I thought, I quickly learned that I have to keep the charger nearby. Either from this being a faulty battery or just the low quality of the generic replacement. It never seems to fully charge to 100, and if it does it drops back down to 90-94 within a matter of 10 mins of use. Even with all the apps cut completely off, no data or voice being used it cut off from 20% down to 0 during the period of 1 hour. Really disappointing. I would recommend purchasing an extended battery (but you do have to get the extended case as well which makes the phone bulky)As for the actual usage. I'm switching over from the iphone so I'm enjoying the new swipe type texting/keyboard. Unfortunately with these I find that I'm fat fingering it more the iphone. The feel of the keyboard touch is so smooth that you don't really sense the actual keys (I guess it's something I'll have to get used to). Also the autocorrect, doesn't seem to be correcting as it should.I've also noticed some lag (during screen transitions, swyping while using whatsapp, and the back out process when you're in a app)Music/Media - Changing/adding music was a breeze, adding pics to the external sd card was simple and it picked up everything and loaded it to the media gallery already in folders (if you have personal pics you DEFINITELY want to reorganize it - also download safe gallery free to password protect some folders/pics)VPN/Tethering/Hotspot - now by default this DID NOT WORK. I was highly upset at first and did a bunch of reading to see how to enable (yes I know the basic steps but it kept saying ""not a valid sim"") So I finally downloaded hotspot toggle widget and it activated it for me. I'm guessing it was either a software malfunction or security issue which was stopping me from turning it on/off through the regular interface.Pictures - look amazing and so does video... Absolutely no complaints thereCellular network - I went with T-mobile since they have the best package here and 4G... Well let's just say T-mobile sucks in a lot of areas but it's great to be able to leverage that hotspot when you're in a 4G area. Also, I had no trouble switching over (since it's a ATT unlocked device). The SIM was popped in, and it registered on their network in about 2 hours.Screen - I constantly worry when I'm going to crack it when it's in my pocket, but it seems pretty sturdy. I've dropped it a few times (it's slippery due to its nice finish). Background light is great indoors but once you get outside, it's all over. This is a downside of most phones but not all!Volume/Ringer - Felt the need to add that it's really not that loud, nor does it vibrate that hard (even after maximizing all settings) Will probably create and amplify my own ringtones for a decent noticeable ringer.I would have liked to see a hdmi output on this one and possibly a slot for the touchpen, louder volume, outdoor contrast and less bloatware (that'll drain the crap out of your battery as well - I disabled 7 apps that came with the phone and haven't needed or noticed them since)",22,4
Samsung,"I purchased this phone to work with the Straight Talk $45 dollar plan on AT&T's network. It took some time to set it up the way I wanted, but it has performed flawlessly since. This phone is a nice step up from my Samsung Exhibit II which took a bath (no, not in the toliet, why does everybody ask me that? lol).The only downside is that if you want to get rid of the extra AT&T apps, you'll need to root the phone. I decided against it since those apps aren't seemingly causing any problems with the E-Mail and other applications I've set up on the phone. And with an additional 32 meg memory card, I don't need the space they take up.I highly recommend this cellphone.",21,5
Samsung,Fast shipping. Retail box packed in bubble wrap and packed inside another box to insure it survived USPS. 13 GB of internal memory minus 1 Gb of ATT bloatware leaves lots of space for apps. Fired it up and stuck in a bring your own phone Straight Talk micro sim card (my old phone had a mini sim). Followed the instructions and was making calls in 15 minutes. Set up the APN info from Straight Talk site to get internet. Amazon is the best.,15,5

Samsung,"I love the iphone's reliability after years but hate their proprietary restrictiveness, and of course that stupid iTunes. I love the Android's versatility but they all go buggy and unreliable after 6 months or so. I almost bought the iPhone 5 over the Galaxy S4, just tired of my old unreliable android that kept freezing at the worst times. Then I saw this ""Active"" version that is waterproof and Dust proof. I was sold.Could not have made a better choice! It's also slick and better looking than the regular Galaxy S4.The keyboard is actually great, I thought I would have issues typing, but it works perfectly, and I like how aggressive it is at correcting--Only problem is, you can't edit the dictionary to add words...which makes it useless. I can't write s*** or a*s and not even OMG or IDK. So I downloaded the Google Keyboard for it, and it's perfect.It didn't seem to come with much bloatware, and it's the smoothest running phone I've ever had (I've had plenty).I am infatuated with it.",12,5
Samsung,"I'm deployed to Afghanistan, and was worried about the dust. I knew I wanted an Android phone, so I did my research. After learning that Samsung made a water/dust proof Galaxy phone, I figured I had to give it a try (as I wanted an S4, and thought this was the best of both worlds). I was a little nervous about the screen, as this phone has a TFT LCD (where as the Flagship S4 has an OLED screen), but so far I haven't had any issues. In fact, as I was researching this phone to make sure it was the best choice for my needs, I read that the TFT LCDs are actually better for outside use (as they don't get as washed out by the sun - something I was concerned about), and so far I haven't had any issues viewing the screen outdoors (even in direct sunlight).I would absolutely recommend this phone for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors, but still want's a smartphone. My only complaint about this phone is that I can't use a lot of the really cool add-on's/accessories that are available for the S4 (such as Qi wireless charging, or the flip cover that shows the time through a window on the front, etc...) Other than that minor qualm, I've been extremely satisfied with this phone.P.S. - Yes, I've tested the ""waterproof-ness"" of this phone, and it works like a champion - just make sure you do what the directions say and verify that the back is completely on (being mindful of the clip/latch under the camera on the back).",18,5

Past couple days it has been restarting itself out of nowhere and when I try to turn it back on, it wont even come all the way on. It flashes the AT&T logo then turns off again. Really frustrating when I'm in the middle of something.",11,3
Samsung,DON'T PURCHASE. The phone I purchased had the serial number altered. Unit purchased was WHITE but serial number was for a RED phone. The phone I received was water damaged(verified by AT&T) and they screwed me out of money. I will contact the Attorney General to file a complaint.,30,1

Thanks for nothing.,63,1
Samsung,"Received damaged unusable phone. With sticky gunk on the inside of the back case, shattered screen, gashed corners, pink face that was not mentioned in description.

Samsung,"I am from Argentina and I purchased the phone ins the US. I would have never expected the ""so called"" Samsung flagship to have a faulty camera. Accordign to what I checked online this has been a common ocurrence in many cellphones (s4) and even after following every advice I found online I was not able to fix the issue. It seems to be a hardware problem.Basically the camera does not work. Whenever I want to uses the camera the phone freezes and then it display an error message. Only the front camera works.Maybe it was my fault for not checking it, but Samsung does not provide international warranty for the cell phones, though it advertise the S4 I9500 as an international version.So, imagine my dissapointment when someone ask me to take a picture and I have to say, sorry my brand new S4 does not have a working camera. jajaja it is shameful.I can now understand apple user who would never change their iphones.I have had a Galaxy S, an S2, an S3 and an S4. However, I now know that my next phone will be an Iphone 5s (as soon as I can get one)!",12,1
Samsung,"Be forewarned. The product description led me to believe I was purchasing an UNLOCKED international version phone. When I received the phone in Afghanistan (for future use in Nepal), the box was clearly labeled ""FOR US SIM ONLY"". Upon powering the phone, I was faced with the sim unlock code screen. I contacted the seller on July 13th to inquire about this issue and was informed that he would forward the issue to his ""tech department"" with a reply within 1 business day. It is now 10 days later and I have received no response from the seller and ended up purchasing an unlock code.The phone itself is a good product but others (who may find themselves in a similar situation as myself) need to be careful. I am led to believe that the seller has either misrepresented the product or does not stand behind his sales. I would think twice before purchasing from the seller ""SNOWMAN"".",15,1
Samsung,"I was very disappointed to see my order- Samsung Galaxy S4 Factory Unlocked phone. As I opened the box, I saw T-Mobile on that and I was like this is not what I have ordered. I ordered Factory Unlocked phone and paid for it, but what I am receiving is T-Mobile unlocked phone. Upon enquiry with the seller they said it is as good as Factory Unlocked phone. But, later when I started using it with a different service provider, it was asking me for T-Mobile Id and password for so many applications. I was getting frustrated.I was not expecting this and I felt like tortured with my order delivery... :(",174,1
Samsung,"It worked, for exactly 1 month. On the 31st day, the phone started to shut itself off, reboot, shut off, reboot, shut off, reboot, ...Many people suggested it might be the battery.

Samsung,"This is not my first time buying from Amazon nor will it be the lastThe phone arrived on time and in new sealed perfect condition. All accessories are very nice except the adapter needed for US wall plugs (connections are a little loose).I was surprised at the quality of ear buds.I have three phone lines with AT&T set up for the LTE mobile 10 gig share plan.Long story short after trying a new micro SIM and working with their tech department i have been told that I can not access my data plan because either AT&T system doesn't recognize the S 4 IMEI (from the CSR/Store Manager) or that this device isn't compatible with AT&Ts LTE network (from AT&T tech department)In good locations (outside & not too far from towers) I can connect to H+ and get about 6 mg download & a little over 1 mg up.The phone is exactly what I'd like. I have to check with AT&T to find out if using a 'non' LTE device will cause any problem with my current data plan. If so, I will have to, sadly, request a return with Amazon.Also please note that there is more than one company selling this phone for close to the same price.Pros: The phone is just like everything you've seen/heard but unlocked. The battery (2600 mah) lasts over a day with heavy use IF most of the fancy Samsung settings are turned off. GPS locks are fast and very accurate (within 30 seconds and 5 meters in the house!)Cons: At first start up you have to switch from German to English. Also there are a lot of German & T-Mobile apps pre loaded and of course no AT&T LTE.If AT&T will let me keep my current plan using this phone I may not return it.I don't feel right returning something I've opened if it's not defective.If I do a return it will be my first.",25,3

Samsung,"I needed a lighter phone than my Google Nexus and was very close to getting an iPhone 5 due to the size and weight, but thankfully a colleague told me about the S4 mini before switching over! This phone is absolutely awesome. I am one of those people who HATE big screen phones, so this is a Godsend for me. It's fast. Perfect size. Light. Built extremely well for a ""mini"" model. Many many features. It's the perfect iPhone killer and has a much lower radiation output too.Its SAR rating (radiation level) is hardly 0.33 watts per kilogram of body mass (on a scale of 0 to 1.60!). Phones with such a low SAR rating are very rare, and much lower than the iPhone 5 which is a whopping 1.6 watts per kilogram!The best part, it's UNLOCKED so you can use tethering all you want with no extra charges. Just be warned, LTE may not work on many carriers so check that ahead of time. Mine runs on AT&T HSPA+ and I'm happy with the speed.Don't listen to the bad reviews here. People complaining about the Micro SIM are just delusional, any major carrier will provide a new SIM for free. Just make sure you get a SAMSUNG SEALED PHONE or send it back! The first one I received was not sealed and wasn't even LTE. Amazon exchanged it for the right one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",178,5

I bought it to use it out of USA, but I had a family that was able to bring it to my country. Due to a problem with the delivery, my cousin could not bring the phone when she returned and because of that, my aunt had to send me the phone by UPS to my country.

Because of that, i received the phone 28 days later than when i made the purchase.Anyway, I get the phone and i started use it and i was working very well the first 4 days, after that, the phone start to fail, the screen remained paralyzed without making any movement, and none of the functions worked up after a while of being immobile, one of the days, the battery overheat and i had to pull out the battery fast and leave the phone off for around 12 hours.I contacted the seller telling the situation, thinking that maybe was the battery, the told me how warranty works with Samsung and the gave the steps to follow. The fact that i was out of USA, in Costa Rica, I had to contact Samsung Latin America and the will give me the places in my Country authorized to cover warranties of the Samsung items. The gave me the numbers and i went to the place hoping the will help out with the problem of the cell phone and of course using the warranty, because the phone was New, only 4 days of use. When I went to the place, they told me they were not able to help me due to 2 things: 1- The IMEI of the phone belong to Europe specific FRANCE and in my country the only cover warranties of IMEI's that belong to Latin America, that way the weren't able to cover the warranty, neither can fix the phone if I was willing to pay for it, because they can not even fix item that doesn't belong to Latin America, that way I had no choices to can fix the phone in my country.When I told the seller what happened, they never tried to help me, they just sent me an e-mail saying they will not cover the warranty and that was it. I had to speak with Amazon customer service to put a complain, and because of that, they tried to be in touch with me again (the seller), but the fact that the phone had more than 30 days since the day of the purchase, they were not able to received the phone back due to the returns policies, even when i explained that I received the phone 28 days later of the purchase and I had just 4 days using it when it started to fail.TO ALL BUYERS: PLEASE BE AWARE, when buy a phone like this one, ask the seller first the IMEI and double check if that belong to the country you live before to make the purchase, because, i know that most of the buyers think that the sellers have to cover warranties or be responsible for defecting items, but in this case Samsung works different and warranty is based on the IMEI of the phone, and they give support and warranties only if the IMEI belongs with your country. In my case, I received a damage item and now i can't have warranty neither support..... and the seller was not what i expected.. they were not kind, neither polite, very disappointed with the seller.To all Buyers, before to make an expensive purchase, please make sure you know everything about all this issues that happened to me, that way you will not lose the money. PLEASE BE CAREFUL!",128,1
Samsung,"I love this phone. It is awasome. It is beautiful, fast, camera is really great. It works with all operators here in Venezuela and with digitel you get 4G. So yeaaaah!! What more can you ask for?.",10,5
Samsung,"Okay. I was definitely worried about buying this phone at first because it was an international, factory unlocked phone. But, I really wanted the phone so I decided to go with it. When I got the phone, it looked awesome! The only sucky part was that the instruction manuals were all in French... But, ? can just watch reviews on YouTube about it. No problem. However, when I went to put my SIM card in, it would not fit. It was WAY too big for it because the phone takes a microSIM card. So crap. But I was so determined to use the phone I was not going to let that get me down. I contacted my local provider- I read reviews from other people on here that said to do so- but they weren't much help. This one lady was like ""Oh, you just break open your SIM card and the micro one I inside of it"". I was like umm okay that's not gonna happen. So, I googled it and then found this DIY on cnet that instructs you how to make a microSIM card out of your regular SIM card by cutting it. I felt really adventurous and decided to give it a try because if worse came to worse I would just have to pay $25 for a microSIM. So,I watched the video, followed the instructions, and I did it! It was not hard to do at all. Then, I took my freshly cut miroSIM card and put it in the phone. It fit perfectly. I turned the phone on and first it couldn't find my provider but then I selected a different option in the service section in setting and up popped my provider. This phone is amazing and is so fast and fun to use. Definitely worth the money. Love it!",109,5
Samsung,"This smartphone is a top line smartphone in a not gigantic size. Although is not for playing, is an excelent option for the standard use.

Samsung,"Unfortunately my experience was bad, yes the phone was delivered on time, and visually everything was ok. But when I tried to connect to my home WiFi I noticed that it didnt work, I tried everything but nothing. Since I was naive enough to by this phone without an international warranty (I live in Venezuela), trusting other reviews now Im stuck with this phone and I had to send it to a technician on my expense to see if he can fix it.Bottom line, don't buy phones that dont have warranty, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, WHY NO WARRANTY? VERY FISHY.Back to my faithful IPHONE!Oh! And I wrote to this seller to seek help and they never wrote back. I GOT A VERY BAD DEAL.VENEZUELAN BUYERS I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER AT ALL.",11,1
Samsung,"There are many good reviews and a few bad so I decided to weigh the odds and purchase. The phone was in good cosmetic condition upon arrival.Upon startup, the default language was French. This was an alarm as I had noted from another reviewer that the local Samsung repair center (Caribbean) would not service these as they are from another zone.Worse: the receiver speaker was not working! After some digging around, I realised that there was a bad connection at the speaker which would work if the speaker was pressed firmly against the case. This appeared to be an uncommon problem globally and I contemplated contacting the supplier for action but realised that cost of return within warranty period may exceed the cost of the unit since I reside in the Caribbean.I decided to forego the warranty and dismantled the phone and confirmed my speaker was faulty. I was able to pad the space between the speaker and the case and reassemble. It works fine now!This is the risk that Caribbean shoppers take when purchasing directly from the USA but it usually is still cost beneficial. Perhaps I just got a bad apple from the orchard.",11,3
Samsung,"The seller says the phone comes unlocked, but that is nor true. The phone is locked and I will have to pay to unlock it.",40,1

Samsung,"If you're lucky and you get this phone, it's great. But BEWARE of fraudulent sellers (e.g. S***TY_Services_WORST_Practices)Let's face it. Someone buying am ""UNLOCKED International Version No Warranty "" phone, is doing it for only one reason: To use it outside the US.So a crook seller sees an oportunity to commit fraud: Let's sell them some $50 used cel phone with a sticker that says i9195 for $300 and when they noticed they where ripped off, they'll be out of the country and won't be able to complain.That was almost my story. Luckily I was able to notice ON TIME, that the model number behind the battery was for an used S7562 (a $50 cel) and not a new i9195 (a $300 one). The worst was that this is a fraud and not an error, since the sticker outside said i9195. They know what they where doing, and they do it on purpose, to criminally cheat us. I tried to contact the seller, but they didn't want to solve the problem, they even insulted me. Luckly, I contacted Amazon and they refunded me the money and I bought it again in another seller, and got the i9195 I wanted (which is great). But I was almost ripped of by this ""Quality_Services_Best_Practices"" crooks. Do you want to risk buying from crooks like these?Read the other reviews for this phone. And you'll se some happy people and some angry ones. This is not due to the phone itself. Some sellers are S***TY_Services_WORST_Practices and they commit fraud to people, hoping they can't complaing from abroad.The i9195 is a GREAT phone, just google i9195 review and you'll see. But you are reading this review, because you pay for the phone YOU GET, and at first I didn' get what I ordered.Be extremely aware from what seller you buy this ""international"" phone, because some are just waiting to rip you off",18,1
Samsung,"I'm not happy, I got a phone that doesn't read the sim card, or is locked, I can't use it in Venezuela. I also came with a charger that used in Europe and its manuals and box are in French language. I had to pay extra money for install a program to read the sim card. NOT RECOMMENDED!",17,2
Samsung,The phone arrived within two days as promised. The phone looked to be in very good condition. I had the phone activated and it appeared to be working fine for about 30 hours. The phone then powered off on its own and would not work again!,10,1
Samsung,"Let me tell you the truth about this phone, and also about what is being offered vs what you get. I work in the Telecom market so I know the details about this phone.The phone itself is great. The problem is the type of S4 you are gettingFirst thing, this phone is NOT unlocked, once you insert a SIM card different from ATT, it will tell you that the phone is locked and you need to insert the PIN code. So if you want to use a different SIM from other carrier-country, you need to find-buy the code from the internet, then the phone is fully unlocked and any SIM will work.Second thing I encounter when trying to use a T-Mobile SIM Card. The AWS bands of T-Mobile for 3G/4G HSPA+ service are closed so you need to look on the Internet to find a way to open it if you want to have coverage on those technologies.Phone connects to T-Mobile LTE only after I dialed a number !!!Bottom line you are not getting a fully operating unlockable phone that can be used anywhere.You have to play with the configuration and search-change its configuration to make it work as a fully unlocked phone to be used with any SIM Card worldwide.",428,3
Samsung,"This review will be less about the product itself (because we all know this is an amazing, powerful, fast, feature-packed flagship smartphone) and more about SIM Compatibility/Network. Because that's why we're looking at unlocked phones, right?I digress. In June, I bought the Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy SIII from WalMart for $459.99. I thought it an amazing purchase that I would not regret... I was so wrong. Little did I know it was a CDMA phone (locked to Straight Talk) and it ran on the SPRINT network. This meant little to me then, but it means the world to me now, because I now know that Sprint is the most awful, bogged-down, spotty, insert-derogatory-phrase-here network on this entire planet. I live in Hawaii, and Sprint's network in Hawaii is an absolute joke. I had no service at my own house OR my workplace that was right on the convergence line of two Sprint towers (Sprint can't switch towers very easily so just went into roaming). The closest Sprint tower to my house had a coverage radius of roughly 1 mile, and still does. And worst of all, it's a 3G-only network. Not a regular 3G network, either. I got EDGE speeds at best. I've never pulled more than 1Mbps on the up or down. Straight Talk's S3 was also very watered down, with a locked bootloader and very limited software accessibility. It was a sad life for me.I had had it. I was done with this pitiful excuse for a carrier. All my friends had either AT&T or Verizon, who both had full LTE buildouts here. They always pulled webpages and videos like lightning. Their coverage was broad and consistent. I figured it was time to pinch a few pennies. I had heard that Straight Talk had released an LTE-capable AT&T SIM Card, and I needed a phone for it to power. I had my heart pretty much set on the S4, but didn't know which one to get.This was the one.The product arrived brand-new and completely unopened. Shiny new S4. I put it in the wall, popped the SIM in, edited the APN settings ([...]) and BAM. The 4G LTE icon popped up in the status bar, as well as two consistent bars of service. My experience thus far has been wonderful - I've been pulling a pretty steady 15up/19down everywhere I've been thus far. I now have coverage in my home. I have yet to see the NO SERVICE icon. This may not be a problem for many of you as you may be already coming from AT&T's network - but it's a whole different world for me.TL;DR? This phone works perfectly with Straight Talk's AT&T Micro SIM card. There is no hassle and no fuss - I set it up entirely online in 10 minutes. If these qualifications meet your criteria, buy this sucker - you won't be disappointed.",111,5
Samsung,"I needed a new smartphone since my iPhone's battery was acting stupid (although, a few months after I bought this Apple recalled my phone for battery issues and now it working great...). When it comes to Android there are so many choices. I chose Samsung since it is about the best contender in the Android market. They frequently update and their software is great. I compared this to Sony Xperia Z and the HTC something (comparable model, but do not remember which). I chose the Samsung mainly for price and battery. I got the AT&T version (at the time this item was listed as AT&T version), it appears to no longer be listed that way. I use Net10 and like not having a contract, so I have to be proactive in finding a great deal on smartphones (no carrier subsidy). I got this for around $300, which is great for this new of a smartphone. It not the current version, but now a days nothing you every buy will be. The specs are still great and it has amazing speed and battery life.The phone has great audio (one of the reasons I chose this over the Xperia Z), the sound is super loud and even out does my iPhone 5. I was disappointed that my iPhone headphones would not work properly in this (could hear and talk, but could not skip or change volume). You do get some nice headphones with this, but I cannot wear the kind that sticks in your ears, they always fall out, and my iPhone headphones have an adapter that makes them over the ear. This is not related to the phone, but Android is annoying with the headphone volume warning.During my time using the iPhone, I have gotten used to Siri. I tried the Samsung program, but it was not that great. I then found Google search and started using it. Not that easy, since you have to disable some stuff to get Google to be the default voice assistant. After some research and messing around I finally got it where I can use Google search and the OK GOOGLE. At first OK GOOGLE worked all the time, but randomly it started only working when I had the phone active (screen had to be on).The camera is amazing on this phone, it offers a lot of neat filters and special shots, but truthfully you are going to use the normal camera, which takes amazing photos (if you change it to 4:3 you can get the highest resolution, not default). I have played with the camera features, and while they are cool, they require more prep than normal use (getting subject ready...), so I do not use them often, more of a 'check out what my phone can do' thing.Stock browser is terrible, use Chrome. Chrome is great, and I am not sure why they still even load the stock browser. Chrome works as expected and is super fast. You can sync with desktop Chrome (linked to your account) and I have not had any issue browsing the web, ""Request Desktop Site"" is about the most useful feature ever for mobile browsers. There is no Flash, but that has been long removed, and most sites have moved on, so not a big deal to me.When I got the phone I spent a lot of time removing the crap apps, these are the apps that AT&T loads and Samsung loads, and that you will never use. They are also made where you cannot remove them (I am not rooting). You can at least disable/hide them from launcher and that makes life a little better. I think I should be able to remove any apps I want (that would not cause the OS to become unstable).I was able to update to KitKat after a painful waste of time dealing with the AT&T updater. Apparently you cannot update except with OTA. Everytime you try to update, if it fails you will get a check again in 24 hours. Really annoying. I found that you can change system time 24 hours in the future and it will let you check. I had to do this several times until I could finally get it to work and say Android KitKat was available... Do not go crazy jumping into the future; just do the minimum each time, so when it finally works, you are not locked out for years... You could always repeat this process for future updates, but it is still annoying.I find Samsung Kies useless. Just put the Micro SD card into the computer and copy your stuff over to it (Movies, Music), and pop it in the phone. If you want you can copy it from the phone to local storage, but I personally keep apps on internal storage and images/music/movies on the SD card. This works great for me.Fancy features on the phone are endless, and for the most part not going to work. All of the fancy voice commands and gestures are very sporadic and sometimes work. The only one I find useful is the wave your hand over to get a quick view, it looks cool in meetings and shows you a quick glance of content. I have not used any of the other features and I did try, but most just stopped working properly. A cool feature I was looking forward to was the eye detection (look away and the movie pauses). I found it often doing the opposite, look away it keeps playing, look back at phone it pauses. I found it more pausing when I tried to watch than anything. I disabled this. Cool in theory, but I guess it cannot detect my eyes properly.This has Google Play and Google Services, which is really the only way to enjoy an Android based device. Without those you will not be able to use Google apps and other apps that rely on Google services. This allows this device to use the Amazon Appstore (great for free apps and loads of giveaways and free credit) and Google Play, the home of pretty much all Android apps.It does offer a feature where you can use split screen with certain apps and can put some content on the bottom and other on top, this is a neat idea, but a screen this small does not make it all that useful. I keep it off, but made it one of my main items in the notification center, so I can enable it quickly if I need to type an email while looking at a webpage or something.I am not going to go over the petty problems I have with Android (like difficulty of quickly seeing emails, and my hatred of the primitive notification system), because it is tough going from iOS to Android, and apparently Android L will fix most of my problems, and this being a Samsung device it will probably get the update pretty quick (I would say Samsung is about the quickest with Android updates).The battery life on this phone is amazing and it works great, I do keep it in Power Saver Mode all the time, and I do not see any different in use vs regular mode. By the end of the day I usually still have 30-50%, and only when I was at the airport playing games for several hours, did I ever get below 10% at the end of the day. You can also keep a spare battery on you which is nice, I personally have a backup battery device that allows me to plugin.Games on this are amazing! I have been playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and it is super clear and fluid with no lag. The device handles it amazingly and it looks and feels the same as it did playing the game on my PS2. I will note playing games will drain the battery, but that is expected (as the CPU,GPU and screen are all working overtime).All of the regular things works as expected, GPS works great, Bluetooth works great (it has Bluetooth 4, but very few apps offer the same level of support as they do for iOS), screen offers great brightness, but is easy to see and work with in very low levels (for battery saving). I have not had any issues with WiFi or cellular. I use Net10 with an AT&T based SIM and I have full LTE service and speeds are as expected. MMS and SMS work (if coming from iOS, be sure to disable iMessage or your iPhone friends cannot message you). The device arrived unlocked (it was an AT&T branded device), and accepted a T-Mobile SIM with no issue.Comparing Specs to the Galaxy S5, I would not pay the price difference. I am happy with this and it is a great phone. It was much cheaper than any current S5 deal, and if you are like me using prepaid, this is a great choice for a super amazing phone that is affordable and gives you the power you need. I am happy with this phone and highly recommend it! Compared to the other Android devices you will most likely not find as many accessories or get as fast of updates as you will with a Samsung flagship phone, even if it is a previous model.",51,5
Samsung,"This phone was not new; it was refurbished. I know this for sure because It had the previous user's personal information on it - his work and home emails were still logged in. This is a serious violation of privacy meaning not only was it refurbished, but the phone had not been wiped. There was no disclosure to say the phone was used. A used phone can be purchased for $100 less. And now, it is malfunctioning. After only two days of light use, it is unable to connect on 50% of calls.",42,1

DONT TURN ON AGAIN now the phone is in SUDDEN DEATH... so now i have the most expensive paperweights of my life... so think twice before buying.",12,1
Samsung,"It arrived on time by Prime. The phone looked new out of box and worked very well. I was worried after reading some of the reviews, but I am the lucky one I guess.

Samsung,Working great on Straight Talk.,21,5
Samsung,"I was excited to purchase the Galaxy S4, however this buyer has misled me by selling me a phone with an apparently bad IMEI which is continuously reported as stolen after a service update by my provider. The phone is not unlocked and is unusable on AT&T.",15,1
Samsung,"For those that are leaving reviews based on what you've read or watched, please purchase the item first, use it for at least a couple weeks, and then give us your ""user experience."" We appreciate the help that you may be trying to accomplish, but if you haven't used the product how can you rate it? Anyway, below is my review of the product.I'm sure you can find all the specs and un-boxing videos as well as picture quality reviews and so on all over the internet, so I won't waste your time typing about that. Instead I'll talk about my personal user experience and you can relate to it or not.I took the GS4-Z (or ""Ph-amera"") for a spin when my wife decided to take us on a mini 5 day vacation. I have to say, this thing is pretty useful. It takes quality photos and at the same time, you can share the pictures with your personal network without having to upload it to a computer or swapping micro SD cards (Although swapping can preserve image quality). If you share images on Whatsapp or other messenger, the quality of the photos will decrease due to their file size limitation. Instead, I chose to send them through email, and they turned out very good. The 10x's optical zoom is great, just be sure to keep your hand steady or place the gadget on a tripod. NOTE: Don't plan on standing this on it's side like a common compact camera to take timed shots, as the curves make it impossible to position it like so without some type of assistance.The camera is heavier and thicker than your average modern smartphone, so be prepared to have this brick swinging in your pocket should you decide to run. I'd say it's just about as heavy as the Galaxy Note 2. I wore the S4 Zoom around my neck with a metal camera lanyard (wrapped in clear rubber), and it worked out very nicely. I hear people complain about the plastic body, but the weight gives it a ""quality"" feel. Battery life is great when using it as a phone. You will however notice a drain if the back facing camera is used a lot. I'm planning to purchase a 2nd removable battery as a backup, so I'm not too worried.If you're planning on using this on a car dash/window mount as a GPS or small viewing screen, start planning on doing heavy modifications or forget it at all. The lens on the phone (as thick as about 3 s4 minis) makes it really hard to fit on standard mounts. Again, I just used my neck lanyard (If you don't mind the occasional swing) on the rear view mirror, and it was fine. Just adjust it a bit shorter, or it'll crash into your window if you happen to slam on the brakes.This device is definitely for a target audience. Currently the GS4 Zoom only comes in white, and although I enjoy the screen quality, many will not be pleased with the resolution provided. If you like thin light phones, this is definitely not it. There are many people that say this device is ugly, but I've handed this over to people to take our photo and they were intrigued! I've heard comments like sleek, nice, different, and very useful to name a few.I'd recommend this camera to anyone on a budget,who no longer wants to carry a compact camera and a smartphone at the same time. You could get the Nokia Lumia 1020 ($700-$1000 No contract/Unlocked price estimate as of 8/2013), but for $400, the GS4 Zoom is a great quality buy at about half the price of the Lumia 1020.",132,4
Samsung,"I mostly wanted a camera with some phone/msging capabilities and this fit the bill. Compared to my Lumia 920, this is a big sluggish when going in and out of camera mode. It is fairly thick and most wallet/smartphone wristlets or clutch bags didn't work with it. Seller was fast/prompt with delivery. Overall, loving the phone and optical zoom is fun to use.Update - 11/6/2013Still enjoying the phone/camera. Husband ordered two Nexus 5 devices and we compared the camera/video recording features. I prefer the way the Zoom handles and takes pictures over the Nexus 5. The Xenon flash is phenomenal. I have tweaked my phone a bit by removing some of the bloatware that comes with Samsung devices. Hoping when the Zoom is launched stateside, more rom options will be available.I can take some good pictures with the device, but I wanted to add that Lumia is better at taking pics in low light settings (talking about auto mode). The Zoom's ""night"" mode helps, but I tend to take pictures of fast moving beings (toddlers and babies) so I end up utilizing the flash and/or manual mode very often when the light isn't optimal.When using the video camera setting, the sound of the lens extending and retracting can be heard--it's not a big deal for me since my subjects are loud anyway, but for others this might be an issue.My son has dropped my phone several times and at quite the distance. I've had no issues with the device malfunctioning despite the treatment. I do have a thin bumper/cover on it, but it helps more for scratch prevention than anything else.",10,5
Samsung,"I purchased the S4 Zoom because I wanted a versatile all-in-one Smartphone/Digital Point and Shoot Optical Zoom Camera/Video Camcorder so that I wouldn't need to carry around multiple devices either for everyday use or for traveling. I would rate the S4 Zoom differently depending on how I am using it.4.5 stars as a Smartphone. The S4 Zoom has a smaller, lower resolution screen, lesser processor, and may be missing some of the non-essential software and interface tricks (such as hovering gestures) found on the regular Galaxy S4, but for the most part it does a great job making calls, running apps, giving GPS assisted directions, surfing the web, video and music playback and most every other function you might want your Smartphone/mini-computer to do.4.0 stars as a Camera for taking digital photographs. I also own a two year old Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS10 with 16x optical (21x digital) zoom range, but which like the S4 zoom has a 16 megapixel CMOS sensor. I consider the DMC-ZS10 to be very good for taking both photos and video. While I knew I would be sacrificing some zoom range with the S4 zoom, which is only 10x optical zoom, in most other respects, both in image quality and functionality, I found the S4 Zoom to be nearly as good or in some case better than the DMC-ZS10 when taking photographs. (Please note that my opinion on image quality is based on viewing the images on a computer or hd television screen, since I do not generally print photographs to paper anymore).2.0 stars as a Video Camcorder. The S4 Zoom takes good quality video as long as you are not using the zoom function. Once you start using the zoom the problems appear. The most glaring problem is a lack of continuous auto focus while zooming. (The lack of continous auto focus can also be a problem when using the burst function in the camera mode). The S4 Zoom isn't the smoothest performer when zooming in and out, and it easily loses focus when doing so. Whenever you stop zooming, the autofocus function pushes the lens in and out to refocus the image, but this results in very jerky video. Another problem is a very noisy zoom mechanism which is picked up on the audio, even in the quiet zoom mode. My DMC-ZS10 is a far superior performer in all of these respects when it comes to taking smooth focused video with minimal camera noise while using the zoom. I do like the fact that the S4 zoom has a micro SD card slot for extra memory when shooting hd video. An extra battery or two are essential if you plan to shoot a lot of photos or video during the day without recharging.3.5 stars is my Overall Rating, which I rounded up to 4 stars above because I like the overall functionality of the device (and Amazon does not allow you to give partial star ratings). I very much like the idea of the marriage of a Smartphone with an optical zoom camera for those of us who would like the ability to take high quality photos and videos in a variety of situations including when it is not always possible to get closer to the action, without the inconvenience of having to carry around multiple devices. To my knowledge the S4 Zoom is a first in this regard. The poor video performance when using the zoom was a big disappointment to me, however, and I may still need to carry around my other camera when I want to record high quality video using the zoom. Had I known about this weakness beforehand and I hadn't been in urgent need of replacing my old Smartphone, which had died, I might have held off until an upgraded version of this product came out. My hope is that Samsung and other companies will not abandon the idea of such hybrid devices but will continue to develop products along these lines. The technologies already exist on separte devices, the challenge is to combine them in one truly high quality all-in-one device.My wishlist for the next iteration of the S4 Zoom: (1) Fix the autofocus and noise problems when using the zoom during video capture. (2) Add a manual zoom ring or lever around or near the shutter button, to allow for one handed operation of the zoom when shooting video or taking pictures. (3) Up the optical zoom range as much as possible, as long as you can keep the dimensions of the device within reason, i.e. something that can be carried around in a pants pocket.",66,4
Samsung,"Great blend of camera and phone! Got it a month ago, and loving it so far. I'm still discovering the cool camera features. Tons of photo settings including color tints for nice sunset pics. The screen is crisp and clear. I've also seen the full Galaxy S4 with higher resolution, but I couldn't tell the difference in display quality. I got some nice pics in sharp focus with the macro mode.It doesn't have the right frequency band (1700) for TMobile's 4G LTE, but makes no difference. Most of the country only has 3G which is more than enough for regular use - email, maps, websites, etc. I figure by the time 4G LTE is available around the country in a few years, Samsung will have the next version of this out.Don't listen to the naysayers. I held off buying this after reading some negative reviews a few months ago. But the defective refurbished piece of HTC cr@p that AT&T sold to me (after charging me full new device price) gave out and I decided to get this. The alternative was Nokia 1020, which costs 70% more and is on windows 8, without the 10x zoom. three big drawbacks that don't offset it's slightly better camera quality.",12,5
Samsung,Solid Device.....Don't be deterred by reviews that claim the S4 Zoom is too bulky...you get used to it and is easy to hold....the pics from this camera are definitely a step above.....the videos are stellar also...BUY IT !!!,16,5
Samsung,Phone was in good shape but when I tried to do software update it wouldn't take I called att they told me it had been under a different number and had a history of not accepting updates. Do not purchase from Super 18 Deals,13,1
Samsung,Purchased this with the thought that I was really getting an UNLOCKED phone as it stated. In reality I got a phone that was not unlocked and still has money owing on it so I can not put it on any carrier nor a prepaid carrier. I can put it on AT&T and pay off the installments plus $45-60 a month for services. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cover it!,14,1
Samsung,"After nearly 2 years using my Moto G with a severely cracked screen I knew that I needed a significant upgrade. The phone arrived in the original packaging and it looked brand new, no scratches, dings, or nicks. It came with about a 20% battery charge. It was a previous AT&T phone so it has alot of branded unnecessary apps and software that I'd rather not have, so I'll take off one star for that. The Uber app wasn't cleared off the phone, which I found strange. I have Straight Talk and the only thing I had to do was take out the SIM card of my old phone and put it into this one. I did have difficulty making calls and sending text within the first few hours of activating the phone.I contacted Straight Talk and they couldn't figure out why I had connection issues. I finally was able to figure it out after turning the phone on and off, and reinserting the sim card,...I had to TURN OFF ""Enhanced LTE"" in the mobile data settings. This was set to default when I got the phone, so just an FYI on connection issues. Overall, I'm pleased with my new phone.ProsVery new conditionIt's fairly big but not obnoxiousWaterproofTONs of featuresExcellent cameraBeautiful screenLong battery lifeConsThe charger that came with the phone died in less than a month, luckily i had another charger on handSelfie ""beauty shot"" camera is grainyVolume is kinda low even on highest settingTextured back looks and feels cheap and flimsyDoesn't come with manual or headphonesBlue notification light too small, hard to see in bright conditions",11,4

Samsung,"When I first ordered my phone it came from Breed/Amazon : May 2016Samsung Galaxy S5 G900A in Black - AT&T GSM Unlocked------------------------------------------My phone gave me issues with connectivity.I bought this unlocked phone to use on my AT&T network.* I had people tell me during calls that they cannot hear me, I can switch to speaker phone but sometimes even that doesn't help.* I got a circle with a bar alerting me to NO SERVICE several times a day. I have to go into airplane mode and back out to get this to go away.* I could not consistently make calls. I got a pop up on my phone telling me ""Network Error. Emergency calls only"".* I also had a lot of trouble sending simple text message and 90% of my MMS (pictures) would not send.I had factory reset my phone twice. I didn't have any third party apps that would cause these issues. I had taken my phone to AT&T and had them put in a brand new SIM and check my settings... Still no fix.----------------------------------------------SOLUTION: RETURNED PHONE / Same model purchased through a different Seller via Amazon7-14-16 UPDATE:Reordered new phone and it shipped via ChubbiestechSo far, so great!!

Samsung,"I was duped on this deal. The phone was supposed to be 4G unlocked. First it did not work out of the box, next the seller refused to take it back without restocking fee and me paying for return shipment. AT&T said that it was not unlocked properly and certainly not done by Samsung but was done (attempted) probably by the Seller after importing it into US (evidenced by the pins of the wall charger) which already voided the OEM warranty.So instead of incurring the restocking fee and return postage I took to a local guy who did the unlock but regardless he said this will not run on USA 4G network unless unlocked properly by Samsung. So I am stuck with a 4G capable phone working on HSPA+. My recommendation, do not buy an unlocked phone unless it is factory unlocked by Samsung.",97,1
Samsung,"The original Samsung seal was broken and SHOPEBEST seller put a non-original Samsung seal instead. I can tell that because the logo was not in same quality as original. I could carefully open that seal (which with original i wouldn't be able to) and found out the Wall chager was an european one, so they had to put a non-Samsung adapter. So i dont know if they broke the Samsung seal because of that or because it wasnt a Factory unlocked pone. They could say that in description or something like that.DONT buy from SHOPEBEST.",12,1
Samsung,"Returning this product because it does not support all of the bands this page says it does, including but not limited to the bands necessary to use 4G LTE service with T-Mobile. The actual box says it only supports these LTE bands: AWS/700/850/1900/2100/2600.",10,1
Samsung,"First off this is my second review. My first review was a 1 star and did not get posted after I submitted the review. I like the phone but need to point out a few things. This is an international phone. Support has to be handled through a country outside of the usa. It is difficult to identify what country that is. This works for me in this case as I spend lots of time in mexico. However, for most people this is an issue and if the country it is attached to is Africa it becomes a very big issue. This phone was not identified as an international phone and the details on this are not made clear to the buyer. Support becomes difficult and I would at least like to know the details on this when I am buying the phone. I would highly suggest to anyone in the USA buying this to just go to bestbuy and pay an extra 50 bucks. I really do not like that my one star review was not posted. When I talked with Samsung support they told me most of the phones sold as unlocked Samsung phones on amazon are from outside the usa and cannot receive support from within the usa. This is the last Samsung phone I will buy on Amazon as this was very nerve racking trying to figure out what the deal is with this phone. When I first tried to update the software it said the software had been modified and could not be updated. This fault later went away. Also, when buying this it was identified as ƒ??by Samsungƒ? the seller was not clear and as I purchased it with prime I assumed it was amazon. This is not the case. Please save yourself some trouble and just buy Samsung phones unlocked from bestbuy. Amazon is great for a lot of things but I feel like this borders on fraud. Apart from this the phone is great so far.",43,3
Samsung,"A stellar phone compared to many out there on the market. It is slightly bigger than the S4, but not much difference. It is incredibly fast, very light and has removable battery and storage (for music, movies, etc.); I had a 64gb Samsung micro SD card installed with plenty of movies.The battery is great depending on what your doing and how your settings are on the phone. It can last anywhere between a whole day to two days; again, this all depends on your usage and settings. If you want, you can always buy an additional battery and just switch it out; that's one of the biggest pro's of having this phone. It also charges extremely fast with the new charging cable.The screen is amazing and crystal clear; by default comes saturated with bright colors that pop out at you; very nice. I have an iPhone 6 and you can tell the difference between the screens. If the color is too saturated for you, there are settings under the display menu that can tone it down a little or even change it to the natural color tone. The speaker is pretty good, doesn't get too loud, but its probably cause it sits on the back of the phone :(. Calls are clear and never had a problem from both ends. I would say the phone is more water resistant than waterproof. There is confusion with many consumers complaining that their phones broke cause they went swimming with it; I wouldn't recommend that. However, I've seen a friend of mine run it down the kitchen sink and drop it into the toilet on accident and nothing happened to it. So I guess it varies from person to person. Other than that, if your looking for a phone that will do almost everything with no restrictions, then this is it.",61,5
Samsung,The first phone I received was damaged and I don't believe it was brand new. The second one amazon sent was perfect ! I could tell from the set up and all the protective coverings that it WAS brand new !! It was an easy exchange and I'm very happy with the phone !!,11,4
Samsung,"Just the best phone ever... period the end. It lives up to the hype. All kinks worked out either by Samsung or verizon. The 5.0 update has been fixed because Verizon waits to release them after they see how it works on other providers and doesn't update until after they are fixed.The many features have been seamless so far. The battery life is very good but it almost doesn't matter because a twenty minute charge gets you up to 60 to 70 % charge that lasts the rest of any day. A ten minute charge can get you back to 30% from 10%. The 30% charge lasts for hours.TheRe are features I didn't think I would use like hover to enlarge pictures. I use it all the time.Turning on ""OK Google"" to respond without touching a button let's you make calls search the internet and more without picking up the phone... and so on.I think it's better than the s6 because it has a replaceable battery (although after market batteries don't charge as fast as the Samsung battery ) and you can add 128gb of SD card memory!The video camera and still camera have been well documented. But the panorama, dual camera mode, low light settings, and much more are amazing. There isn't a need for other apps to do the different things like HDR and fast burst. The slow mo is great and the ability to take still pictures while recording video without stopping is actually kind of brilliant. There is much more but I'll stop here. I completely see why people who have this s5 aren't upgrading. Too good is hard to improve on.",25,5
Samsung,Great phone absolutely love it ! I'm using straight talk & upgraded from my Verizon Galaxy s3 to this s5 & the transition was unbelievably smooth. I just removed my Sim & SD cards from my old phone & put them in my new one & never missed a beat. Would highly recommend !,25,5
Samsung,"The phone was a knock off Galaxy S-5. It had Samsung written directly under the camera lens. REAL Galaxy S-5 only has the lo-go of the company;i.e., AT&T-the blue ball, Verizon-the ƒ??then Verizon, T-Mobile...so and so on, NOT the actual,"" Samsung "" manufactures name. There are U-Tube video's about the knock off Samsung's Galaxy S-5 and/or any version of cell phones I'm sure however, I didn't look for other cell phone knock off's, so I can't say anything about other manufactures cell phones, don't want to get myself in trouble there. Anyway, when I opened the box, the phone was wrapped, then I pulled on the cardboard separator and lo-and behold, crap, where's the instruction manual,? MISSING?! YES! So then I looked at the charger cord, not wrapped and it was,"" THE WRONG ONE!"" and the charger wasn't wrapped either. I thought to myself, ""man this is a knock off, manufactures always have the pieces wrapped and /or covered in some way or fashion."" I have shopped here at Amazon for almost ever it seems, and I never have had this problem with a seller selling junk. I did contact Amazon, they were awesome as always, seller shipped out the charger wire and owners manual three days later after being contacted. O.K., in all fairness you have to give them,""the seller"" time, I understand, their busy and stuff, and/or have a crap load of returns! Sorry, being sarcastic, by the time I received cord and manual, heck I had already returned the phone because after borrowing a charger cord, the dog-gon-cell phone wasn't working correctly. This was supposed to be an,""UNLOCKED"" cell phone. On start it said,'Verizon"" o.k., then I turned it off. Put in the sim card and restarted the phone, same thing,""Verizon"" on start up, then it said that my sim card wouldn't work on this,""verizon cell phone and that I needed to contact verizon for one of their contracts and sim card."" I just got away from Verizon cell phone.So I said,""crap"" of course and did some more searching, well I didn't purchase it on Amazon, sorry Amazon. I went to, yes being honest here,""New Egg!"" Bam, awesome around the same price, they also have 100% returns, offer extended warranties and so forth. The cell phone I purchased at New Egg was original. AT&T lo-go under the camera lens, Galaxy S-5 at the bottom, awesome!! Finally, the phone I really wanted and I was able to use any sim card I wanted to!!Long winded I know, sorry but you needed to get all the intel possible. Thank you.",13,1
Samsung,"I love this phone. I bought it to go on Verizon prepaid. If you are doing that, make sure you take it to an actual verizon store NOT an authorized dealer. But it's fast,great battery life and charges quickly. I bought it used on here and made sure it was prime eligible so if I didn't like it or it was broken I could return it free of charge.",19,5
Samsung,"This phone really did as advertised. I wanted to buy a phone that could be carrier independent since I do a lot of travelling, and shortly after I bought this I got to take it with me to Mexico. Once I landed, I stopped at the local Telcel and put in one of their SIM cards (need to understand the local language of course) and it booted right up! There were a few oddities with using the phone there, but that was due to the provider, not the phone itself.All in all this is one sweet phone. I love most everything about it, from the ability to upgrade the memory size, to being able to change the battery (take THAT apple!). I have since sold my buddies and girlfriend into getting one as well. So won't you join android and get with the REAL cell phone company?",15,5
Samsung,"Bought 2 of these, they are great phones, They have almost all the features of the full size S5, but at a much better price. You do loose some memory, and the back camera is not as many pixels, but It is a Samsung, So even the mid range Samsung cameras on phones are better than other phones with more pixels that cost much more, but that's a whole different issue. OK so I am using these with Straight Talk, It takes the micro SIM card (and can hold up to a 128GB micro SD card.) you just need to call them and if you already have an account its like 4 bucks for the SIM card and free overnight shipping if ordered before like 2pm or something. Or buy one at Walmart.The Finger Print scanner: Felt the need to do this review for this reason.As I know 5 other people that bought this phone, and 4 out of the 5 were telling me how crappy the scanner feature is. The scanner is the BUTTON, not the screen. The screen is for viewing and yes you can touch it, however it cannot scan anything. It is the middle home button that has the biometric scanner in it. The screen arrows do make it look like you should swipe the lower middle part of the screen.(but that is because they cant make the arrows go past the screen to the button) So if you were having this problem, Go to settings, fingerprint scanner, and re-do it the setup using the button and when you swipe, you are not supposed to try to get your whole finger print like taking a finger print on paper from the tip all the way down, you only want to scan the center part of the finger/thumb you are using(shoot for a spot on your finger you can aim and hit every time), as currently it allows up to 3 prints , as i have each thumb as that is how i hold it to unlock it and then a pointer for backup or if the phone is flat on a table or something. See how the feature works once set up and used the correct way, I'm sure its probably in the user manual, but then again I didn't even open that, nor did anyone else i asked that was complaining about the scanner. So this maybe in there, but I seen so many people complaining when talking about this phone, and 4 out of 5 people I knew personally all were doing the same thing wrong. So i hope that helps someone.Overall this is a great phone, not top of the line like its big brother, not as much memory, or pixels in the back camera. but the average person wouldn't even notice the differences anyway when using the phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone who asked me, I would buy it again today in a heartbeat!",91,5
Samsung,Met my expectations. Works perfectly in Venezuela.,70,5
Samsung,"Replaced an S3-mini with this. No doubt there are a lot of haters of the Samsung line period, and the mini is NOT a smaller version of the S5. Understanding that, and not needing anything more than a solid phone, I like the minis for their size and the Android system. The display is clear, the system is more than fast enough for me, and the 64gb sd-micro card gives me all the storage room I really need. I really like the phone. Hate dealing with the iPhone proprietary everything that badgers my wife and kids (HAD to have the iPhones!). Worked flawlessly with ATT here in the states (the phone is getting the 4-stars, not the provider...not by any means). They did supply a sim card with no trouble, just had to take the phone into the nearest shop. Rep was shocked that the S5 mini was on the market, first one he'd seen. About half the price of a non-contract S5 from ATT. Satisfied.",38,4
Samsung,"Not unlocked. I called Samsung to see why this thing wouldn't work with my SIM and they told me it was from India and not covered under US warranty. It's also not a dual-SIM and the package had been opened and had a US charger adapter thrown in that would go over the European/Indian charger plug, like I wouldn't notice.It's no big deal since I can send it back and get a refund, I'm more disappointed about how long I had to wait in order to get it delivered. My girlfriend ordered a full size fold out couch off the internet and that didn't even take this long.All in all I'd say the S5 Mini is a great product just be careful who your seller is when you buy it off of Amazon.",12,1
Samsung,"Love this phone. The one I received is a G800F Duos and I don't need the extra SIM card capability atm but it might be nice to have in the future. Works great with my Consumer Cellular service.

Samsung,"The service via Amazon and vendor is excellent. Now to the phone. The phone is great, features and ease of use are also excellent, network connectivity works well on GSM carrier T-Mobile in central Florida, basically I get 42 Mbps speed using their 1700 and 1900 bands for HSPD+ speeds. Quality of construction is excellent, nice AMOLED screen, perfect size for my wife that doesn't need a 5"" tablet phone that is hard to balance in one hand. The items that one has to be aware of are it is the S5 mini 3G WCDMA, 2G GSM phone, it a international version made for the African/Arabian markets (Persia in particular) and therefore there is no US warranty on this item at all. Get a SquareTrade warranty! As a matter of fact, you can't even register it on the http://www.samsung.com/za/consumer/mobile-phone/ website. This model has the G800HXXU1ANGF modem that is compatible on North American carriers, the Android version is the G800HXXU1ANH5 (KitKat 4.4.2). For less than half the price of the S5 locked version from US carriers, it is well worth the price and one is not locked in to a specific carrier. This vendor had an excellent price that beat out Ebay vendors as well.",16,5

Samsung,"Both a warning and some good news. The sellers do not seem very well informed, so here is the result of my research.WARNING - This is not warrantied in the U.S. You have to call the Samsung EU for assistance.Samsung UK 0330-726-7864GOOD NEWS - Unlike the U.S. version of this phone which is only warrantied for 1 yr, this actually has an automatic 2 Yr Warranty of parts, 6 months for battery, and 12 months for the charger.If you live in the U.S., you will have to check the bands (4G: LTE 800 / 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 / 2100 / 2600) against what your carrier offers, as some, like T-mobile only use 1700/2100, and thus you will not get as much 4G coverage as when you order a phone from your carrier and it is set up for their bands. This may or may not make a difference to you, but you should research this first, and test the phone when you get it to see if you are getting the service level you desire.",205,1
Samsung,"This has been the worst purchase of my life! First of all, this is a knock off phone and not the actual one, and when they still refused to return it and I tried to use it it would not even work! and their reply is simply, ""refer to the manufacturer of this product as it is under warranty.""

Samsung,"Instead of offered international model SM-G900F, I have received a chinese SM-G9006V re-flashed with G900F firmware. All labels on the phone and on the box say it is G900F (fake labels I guess), but when you boot it into the download mode it shows that it is actually SM-G9006V with Knox counter ticked (which means it was re-flashed).There are a lot of fake Galaxy S5 phones on the grey market and one of the only few good ways to check if the phone is genuine is to boot it into the download mode and see the real model number.And the charger that is included with the phone is not powerful enough to charge it. The phone see the charger connected, but it doesn't charge at all.Seller: BlutekUSA.Update:More problems discovered:1. This phone can't connect to the secured wireless network when MAC Address Filtering is turned on (phone's MAC is registered in the list of allowed devices). At the same time Galaxy 4 mini, Galaxy Ace, iPad-2 Mini and HP Touchpad connect with no problems.2. The first screen of download mode is all in Chinese symbols. When you get past that it shows the model number SM-G9006V. It also shows that Knox Counter was tripped (0x1 (4)), and that the system installed is a custom system, not official. At the same time it shows official G900FXXU1POEC system in the ""about the device"" tab in ""Settings"".3. The recovery mode is not accessible, so there is no way to restore this device to the factory settings. When booting into the recovery mode, it shows the following message: ""Recovery Booting.... Set Warranty Bit: recovery"" and after a little bit reboots into the normal user mode.My guess is that in attempt to sell cheap SM-G9006V as a G900F, the phone was flashed with partially modified G900FXXU1POEC firmware, as there is no way genuine G900F firmware can be flashed into the wrong device).4. There is a half millimeter gap between the bezel and the glass on the left side of the phone.I'm looking into returning this item before it is too late.",10,1
Samsung,"Okay, if you're here you probably have made your research about the S5 so you know it's an awesome phone. I do, however, wanna talk about some aspects of this version since it's and unlocked version.First of all, yes, do you get the SM-G900F version. So don't be afraid you'll pay for that one and get a SM-G900H instead (that was one of my concerns when searching for it since a read different reviews that talked about that). Also, I read in some of the questions that it didn't came with a box; that it was new and had all of the plastics but that it didn't came with a box. False, the box is there with no signs of being opened since all of the stickers are still intact. If you compare it with the box of a phone that has been bought at a carrier, the specs list is in a different order, uses different words but in the end it's all the same. The biggest difference, I think, is the fact this one says LTE while carrier ones say 4G LTE. But then again, no big deal.However, although 4G capable, I am NOT able to get 4G signals all the time. I have an AT&T sim card and for the first days I wasn't able to get 4G at all. I then called costumer service and they updated my phone info (cause apparently the system registered it as a 2G phone rather than a 4G device) and guided me through creating the specific APN settings for AT&T's network. Sadly, even after that it didn't worked. But after that though, I started having problems with my network signal. I didn't always had all of the signal bars and my phone even started disconnecting from the network completely displaying the ""Only emergency calls"" sign. To which in many occasions I had to reboot it more than one time in order for it to get signal again. Long story short, I am now able to get 4G speeds in SOME areas for a little amount of time. And it's 4G, not 4G LTE. The rest of the time it's stuck at H or H+. Yes, I know that not every single area is 4G capable, but I live in Boston and I know for a fact we're pretty much set. Also, it's frustrating to be sitting next to someone on the train and seeing how their phone has 4G LTE even underground, when mine disconnects from the network and enters ""only emergency calls"" mode. And, to make things worst, although my browser and apps work, I'm am NOT able to send multimedia messages. I've spent more than 3 hours total speaking with AT&T's technical support and they assure me they've done everything in their power but that the problems seems to be my phone. Of course, they can't guarantee that a phone that isn't bought from them will get 4G speeds or any data whatsoever and the only thing they can recommend at this point is for me to reset my phone and call back again in order to be guided though the process from the beginning.Honestly, I don't even have an unlimited internet plan, so I have to be cautious with my data usage and there for only use it when I'm on the train. The rest of the time I'm either at home or at work, both of where I have wifi connection. H+ is almost 4G and the speed isn't bad, really. So if this isn't a deal breaker for you, buy it! Also, I'm not saying every single phone and carrier will have this problem, I tend to be a little unlucky when it comes to this things so it could just be me! I'm just disappointed because the phone itself says 4G on the back where it usually says ""Galaxy S5"" so it's quite ironic that I can only get 4G speeds at certain locations for a couple of minute...Also, the phone does NOT bring a USB 3.0 cable, it brings a 2.0 cable with no Samsung branding... I don't really know it that means anything at all, but been the SM-G900F version I did expected it to bring the USB 3.0 cable.",120,3

I decided to give this as a Christmas gift for that special woman in my life however a good deed, thought and gift has turned into a nightmarish experience. I'm not sure if it's Samsung's fault for not having better measures in place to prevent false CHINESE copies of their phones leaking into their inventory or if it's a planned ploy to get over on less educated customers. Also I think Amazon hold companies passing off fakes via their website to the highest level of responsibility because it does affect one's thought towards making future purchases of certain items.Yesterday after opening this gift my loved one plugged it up to charge the battery as anyone would do, but when we return later that evening I noticed immediately there was a problem when the recharge light was still red. So I unplugged it, removed the battery for 1 minute, and revered the process again, but there was no change for it appeared as though the phone wouldn't charge. My lady unplugged the phone and powered it up, but she couldn't get past the ""Language Selection"" menu which was English (UK) ONLY so she asked me to look at it. I attempted to navigate through the phone without any success. When I pressed start the phone did nothing and when I hit the power button the phone shown only ""Turn Off and Restart"", but wouldn't do either when selected, so I had to remove the battery to shut it down.The next morning after breakfast I started doing online research into the problem after booting the phone to the Android ROM upgrade window. First before entering that screen a window appeared and all of the characters were written in Chinese versus Korean. As a veteran that have served overseas I can clearly distinguish many of the Asian languages from one another especially Korean which is more distinctive. Also I work as an IT Specialist and have been in the field for over 20 years. I downloaded the latest versions of Kies and Smart Switch, but neither software would recognize the phone and at that point my suspicion grew even more. I started conducting a search online of the ""ODIN MODE - Product Name: SM-G9006V"" and then is when I discovered I'd received an ETREMELY well made and PROFESSIONALLY packaged CHINESE made SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 knock-off!I'm glad the events that occurred happened otherwise if everything had functioned as it should have I'd probably NEVER EVER known I'd purchased a Chamsung Calaxy S5! No offense to anyone Chinese!I've added photos to substantiate my claims. Amazon please post this for it would be in the companies best interest to let other prospective buyers beware. I want to give SAMSUNG and Amazon a fair chance at righting this VERY WRONGFUL act before taking to social media.",20,1

Samsung,"I have to preempt this review by stating that it is not about the Android operating system or the Samsung hardware, but rather about the usefulness of having a dual-SIM phone and how to use it.I do extensive travel and as a long-time AT&T customers with an iPhone since day 1 have been plagued by sky-high international fees. I decided to take the plunge and use this phone for when I travel. To do that, two things are required: (1) a deep understanding of how Android handles multi-SIM, and (2) a way to 'trick' the AT&T SIM into believing it's still in the iPhone.(1) Android handles 2 SIMs as follows: there are 2 slots in this phone for micro-SIMs. Through the SIM management program you can select which SIM does what, and how both work. For example, you can designate SIM 1 as you data SIM (only one SIM can be a data SIM at any time). Another example: you can select whether the two SIMs accept simultaneous incoming calls. My experience is that it is pretty intuitive once you get the idea that you now have 2 numbers and 2 providers. In my case, when I travel, I use SIM slot 1 with the local SIM and SIM slot 2 with the AT&T SIM. For data I use SIM 1. I allow simultaneous incoming calls.(2) This is more tricky. First, you may have to buy a SIM adapter. For my AT&T iPhone nano-SIM, I got this one:?ÿMediaDevil Simdevil 3-in-1 SIM card adapter kit (Nano / Micro / Standard)?ÿand it works very well. Second, you have to configure the APN settings for your provider since the SIM is not pre-configured to be in the Samsung. In my case, the AT&T settings can be found here: http://apn-settings.com/us/att-apn-settings/. Once you input them, you restart the phone and you're now on the AT&T data and MMS plan. Note: you don't need to do this if you're just going to make voice calls. If you buy a local plan in the country of your choice, you will have to go through the same routine by following their APN instructions. I have found that most SIMs/plans you buy internationally are very different from local US plans as they assume you're going to put your SIM in a non-sponsored phone and need to configure it.My verdict on the usefulness of 2 SIMs is decisive: very positive.On the Samsung and Android: I'm actually impressed. Yes, I wish there were a dual-SIM iPhone but that won't ever happen I guess. Hence, this is the best choice and Samsung made it a very good one.UPDATE 1On a trip to Switzerland I noticed that Android does a lot of data 'checks/pulls', unless you configure your apps not to do that. Most notably (of course) email where default settings make it pull data every 15 minutes, but also location services and Android updates. You have multiple choices how to deal with this: one is to tell these services never to pull, causing you to always performmanual syncs, or another is to tell the services to only pull when you're connected to WiFi. Since many folks that use this phone do so because they roam extensively, I wanted to give this heads-up.",77,5
Samsung,"If you are looking for a Dual Sim phone but don't want to compromise and have a crappy phone. Then look no further.Bought this phone because i travel a lot and hate to be removing covers all the time and switching sims.Tested this phone in the US with T-Mobile in Boston area and it work great pics HSPDA signal from T-Mobile and was always blazing fast between 5 and 10 Mbps (more than enough to do wathever you need on a cell). haven't been able to verify if LTE would work in US, because it's a UAE phone. So far it doesn't go 4g with t-mobile.The phone itself is blazing fast with a quad core cpu and 2gb of ram it multitasks very well.The battery life is also very impressive for a dual sim high end phone travelled with it for 8 hours and i still had 46% charge when i got to the hotel (i was streaming music for the whole trip).",47,5
Samsung,"Be aware you may not be getting a 100% new device. I bought my S5 G900FD DUOS from a vendor here called SHOPEBEST and it came in what looked to be a sealed box, but upon closer inspection, it turned out that the seal was a larger fake one designed to cover and hide the smaller official seal. Inside, the plastic protective cover had been damaged on a corner and there were signs that the contents had been moved around.That said, I'm still very happy with the smart phone itself. The version I received came from the UAE. I was able to update it from Kitkat to Lollipop 5.0 using Odin 3.09 and using the G900FDXXU1BNL9 (Russia) firmware. G900FDXU1BNL3 (Malaysia) version did not work for me, but it may have been because I was trying to use an earlier version of Odin. If you google the terms, ""S5 DUOS Lollipop update"" you'll find some sites with instructions on how to manually update the firmware. Knox security counter was tripped too, but I'm uncertain if it was because of the update or if it came to me this way. I had forgotten to check prior to updating so shame on me.Hardware-wise, my S5 Duos runs well and both SIM slots work using US SIM cards. Primary SIM card slot installation is a bit tricky as the slot is *underneath* the microSD slot and there's no spring ejection mechanism to help pry it out. It accepts and recognizes a 128GB microSD just fine btw. Just HSPA+ speeds in the US, but I'll have a good chance to check out the LTE speeds in Europe next month. I have a wireless charging flip cover and it fits very securely. I often use my phone as a GPS, so I have the cover folded around the back against the car cradle. Even so, the wireless charger I have is able to continue charging the phone. I was a little concerned the charging signal wouldn't penetrate, but glad it worked out.I'll update more as I get some additional play time using this smartphone.",11,4
Samsung,"The product met my expectations partially, since the LTE band doesn't work in my area (Uruguay). Despite the local company provides the LTE service, they say that even the phone is international version the LTE band from this phone is not useful in some providers of different countries. This is very sad.",13,3
Samsung,"Samsung S5 dual sim phone arrived promptly and all brand new packaging. My only complaint is that production was intended for Kazakhstan, and it does not have a USA power plug on the battery charger. I got an adaptor and it charges fine, but I think if it is going to be sold on Amazon, it should have an adaptor or the correct power plug.The phone is amazing with lots off additional features over my previous S4. Dual SIM is awesome and I can choose which SIM to send texts, make calls or use data. Either phone number can ring and call wait etc all works great. I use one SIM for USA and the second is a local SIM for whichever country I am travelling in, which is much cheaper to use than roaming.",19,5
Samsung,"I have used it for one week and I like most of its features (especially those subtle ones such as I can use the camera or change my sound setting even when the screen is locked) except the following ones for the time being.(1) I cannot write any data to the external SD card of SM-G900FD by using 3rd party apps. Can anyone give me a procedure of rooting it ? I cannot find the rooting procedure of SM-G900FD in the Internet.(2) I like the encryption feature of it very much. However, I cannot use the finger scanner feature of it when I am using its encryption service. Why can't the user use both features at the same time ?(3) When using the browser provided, the font size is too big for those items in a pull down box/button. I can only see 3 to 4 items on the screen at the same time.Remark : It provides handwriting feature to input both English & Chinese. (2014-09-14)",15,4
Samsung,"My phone was defective when it arrived - it wouldn't read any SIM cards. I returned it and they refuse to exchange it. They claim that I flashed it and lost the IMEI#. I did none of that. I returned it exactly as I got it, with one exception: I left the USB cable at home. Since I didn't want to go back home to get it, I expected to get charged for a new one. But they made stuff up about me flashing it to get out of exchanging the defective phone.If you get this phone, DO NOT BUY FROM SHOPEBEST. Get it somewhere else. I got scammed for more than $700 and have nothing to show for it.Watch out for this fraudulent seller.I've already made a claim with Amazon, but haven't heard back yet.Edit: Finally got a refund, but I got hit with a $300 restocking fee. Contacted Amazon again, and they fixed it. I now have the full refund. Very happy with Amazon's customer service, but never again will I buy from Shopebest.",356,1
Samsung,"I ordered the phone Friday April 11th before lunch time, and selected one day shipping. I then called the seller to confirm they had it in stock and it would be going out. They told me shipping cut off for the day was 5pm (plenty of time) and they were just waiting on Amazon to send them my order details to their computer system.The phone did not arrive until Wednesday April 16th. I am disappointed it took 5 days when i paid for one day shipping.Second issue was when i opened the package they sent me the SM-G900F model. As you can see they clearly state more than once in the item description they are selling the SM-G900H version. After researching the difference it looks like the G900F is supposed to have LTE bands 800/850/900/1800/2100/2600 MHz which the G900H does not have. However when i put my T-Mobile SIM in, i can not get LTE, I only get HSPA+.Third issue is the manufactures seal on the box was broken, the box had been opened. All of the accessories appear to be accounted for. The clear plastic static shields where still attached to the screen and back of the phone. However when i turned the phone on someone had already went through the setup screens. You know when you first turn on a new phone it ask you your language, owners name, basic setup questions, etc, before getting to the home screen. So i went into the settings and did a factory reset.Other then that the phone seems to be working fine, minus not being able to get LTE with T-Mobile.",127,4
Samsung,"First of all, I returned this Galaxy S5 because it came defective (display issues and charger not working properly), but I was able to try the S5 for a few days...I don't understand that the S5 has lag issues, I had performance issues while I was playing REAL RACING 3, frame rate dropping... Which I can only think is the samsung bloatwares installed... Even though, with the Exyon Quad Core; 1.9GHz,1.3GHz (8 cores CPU), the S5 must have been running very smoothly...The cam is not good in low light conditions... Which is crazy... The heart beat scanner is silly, because it's gimmicky, it takes more battery life and nothing more... Also, the Heart beat scanner brings inconsistent readings all the time...I am very disappointed for a device that cost more than $600 not having a premium look and performance... I had the samsung S3, it was a great device. Don't get me wrong, Samsung S5 still a very solid high end phone but it could have been much better. Also, Be aware this is the International version 3G... Paying more than $600 where you are going to get only HSDPA+ speed... I didn't appreciate it at all...If you want to buy the S5, I tell you this! WAIT for a couple months... The S5 will get cheaper. Or wait for the S6...And I feel relieved now... I am going to wait for the LG-G3 instead...",15,1
Samsung,"Hello !!I am writing this review so maybe I can help someone not waste 600 bucks on this deal.Bought this phone 2 months ago and shipped it inside the US.You might initially think this phone is sold by Samsung as Amazon states on the seller name. Well, it is not. It is really sold by a company called Worldwide Distributors.The model that this company shipped me is originally built to be used in Africa so the charging cube isnt useful with US power outlets; had to buy an original in the US to get started with it.This model will work almost with any US operator or at least mine worked with AT&T, Verizon, Telcel (Mexico), Claro (Argentina, Colombia).The issue I am having with this phone is that after 3 weeks of normal use, the display stopped working, the screen will go blank and it will remain unusable for maybe an hour. After this time period the display will come up but all tinted pink, that lasted for an hour and then the display will go blank again. This cycle repeated every day so you may imagine how frustrated I got with this hardware issue. After getting my old iphone 5 up again, I took the phone to a Samsung service shop and they refused to honor the warranty arguing that this product was not purchased through an authorized Samsung reseller and they can't even be sure that it wasnt a stolen one. After a month and 5 days I issued a return request to Amazon explaining the challenges I was facing with the product and the warranty claim. Amazon forwarded this return request to Worldwide Distributors and they answered the claim: ""Dear BuyerYour unit has a 1 yr warranty through the manufacturer. Please contact them for further assistance. Samsung Contact: [...]""I responded that I have already taken the phone to an authorized Samsung repair shop to honor the warranty and they refused to service my unit.Since then I havent had any news from Worldwide Distributors or Amazon, so I'm stuck with a 600 usd unusable phone and really frustrated with this company's customer service.Hope this helps !!!",645,1

Samsung,This was the 2nd one of these phones that I purchased and had to return. Both of the T-Mobile phones were never paid off by the original owner and both had a permanent lock on them by T-Mobile. When I asked the clerk in the store what I would need to do to activate them I was told I needed to locate the original owner of the phone and have them pay off the balance on it.Don't buy this phone on-line it is not worth the problems.,10,1
Samsung,"I had never purchased a certified pre-owned phone before. I was a bit skeptical, but really wanted to upgrade from my old LG, but didn't want to spend $600+ on a phone. T-Mobile sells the certified version of the Samsung Galaxy S5 also, but it was $100 more, so I decided to give this a try. The delivery was fast (I have Prime) and it came in original Samsung Galaxy 5 box. All the accessories (power cord, earbuds, battery) were included and the device looked new to me. I pulled my sim card from my old phone and put it in this one (luckily both were micro sim), put the battery in and turned it on. It worked perfectly. T-Mobile had 3 updates to the operating system which downloaded and installed with no trouble.",45,5

But after all these weeks, it is now too late to return the phone through Amazon.When I received this phone, it appeared new--the problems were not so glaring that I noticed them at first. After several weeks of use however, I noticed a few problems. The screen is partly burned out. It looks like it was left on the Facebook home screen for most of its previous life--ghosts of the icons are visible at the top of the screen. Most of the screen does not display true colors. It has a yellow cast.The phone also is quite slow, and I am in general not too particular in this area, but it is slower than the galaxy S4 that it replaced, and it freezes up frequently. This leads me to believe there are internal problems as well as the screen problems.I am not happy with the functionality of the phone, and am not happy with the seller.",18,1

Samsung,"Ive never had an issue with certified refurbished items with amazon before so this is kinda disappointing. No big flaws or damage, screens fine and almost 0 body flaws on the phone, however the volume rocker is jammed in, so you cant actually do much because it constantly pushing a volume up command and pop up, ive tried resetting and taking out the battery but no dice, and it is stock so not an app conflict or anything. Just sucks but i guess ill try returning it but this has definitely made me wary of their certified refurbished quality",12,2
Samsung,"The phone is nice looking but is defective. It was not charging. Don't know if it's the phone or the battery that is defective, definitely not the charging cable. I just sent it back. But just a head's up.... you pay for the cost of shipping it back. Which is a big negative for me since it is their phone that's bad.BTW, the back cover has a logo of AT&T on it which did not show in their picture. I know it's an AT&T phone because of the ""A"" in G900 but I thought the logo won't appear in the back cover like it showed in the picture.",11,2

Who buys a new phone and expects it to fall apart in 3 months?How insane to spend more than $700 on 2 new phones, they both break and the seller refuses to assist on the second one because it is a few days past their warranty. Unbelievable! Terrible product and terrible customer support.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. AND DO NOT BUY FROM BREEDFURTHER UPDATE: BUYER BEWARE - apparently this phone is not new even though it is sold as new. I contacted Samsung as the phone was supposed to be under manufacturer warranty. WRONG - the phone had 'unauthorized repairs' according to Samsung. The IMEI number tells everything about the phone. The phone that I purchased was gold but according to Samsung' records, the IMEI number details it was supposed to be Charcoal black so they wouldn't honor the warranty because it was changed.

Samsung,"I ordered this phone to replace a Samsung S4 that had a broken screen. The shipment arrived quickly, and seemed to be in good physical condition. When I started the phone up for the first time, I began to activate it (Verizon). Once activated, the phone began to update its firmware. I few minutes into the update the phone restarts by itself without finishing the update...odd. I restart the phone and it indicates that the update failed. I then try again, and minutes later the phone restarts randomly again. I took my phone to both Best Buy and Verizon and they both said it was defective. I requested a replacement through Amazon, and they promptly shipped me another phone. This time before even turning it on, I notice the screen is cracked right out of the box. What kind of certified pre-owned/ refurbished garbage are you selling? Do I have to cross my fingers and hope for the best when I get another replacement? I would stay away from this phone.

Samsung,"Hard to give anything a 5 but this phone is smooth and so much of a step up from my old Galaxy. I was considering a Samsung Note or a Iphone 6 plus but I liked the fact that this phone , while not water proof was at least water resistant and that it has a replaceable battery . Both things are getting hard to find. The fact that I am also a new T-mobile customer might be adding to my satisfaction. After Verizon for almost 30 years I felt that they hung me out to dry because I was grandfathered with unlimited data. They would not offer me a new phone or a decent priced plan so along come t-mobile and while I had to buy my phone the plan is over $100 a month cheaper and gives me more data than I use. Verizon could have kept me but like a lot of businesses they don't value their existing customers. I got a new phone that I love and trying a new service provider that is great so far.",12,5
Samsung,"Phone was perfect for my needs. I was a bit nervous about it being Certified Pre-owned, but I quickly realized that these phones are not a bad deal. You get the same 1 year warranty as if it were new and if I had not been told it's Certified Pre-owned, I probably would not have known, LOL. The box is original OEM and all the accessories were OEM/original. There is a sticker on the front of the box that states it's Certified Pre-owned. Great bang for your buck here, Go for it if your thinking about buying this phone.",27,5
Samsung,"*******UPDATE********* Still works great and am starting to get into the health functions, like heart rate monitor and stress tester. Trying to get one for my wife who had a bad experience (still is) with an International version of the S4. The T-Mobile visual voice mail is a nice feature that apparently comes standard with Apple devices, but I'd much rather have this phone than any of the iPhones........enjoyI've had the phone 4 days and other than it initially hemming up new download applications while it was attempting to load a ton of previously installed google play applications from my old phone (definitely recommend stopping all downloads and manually download and/or update only a couple at a time), it's running great!!! I was worried initially because while it was downloading a ton of apps, when I would move my fingers toward the top of the screen it would start to glitch, but have not had that issue since - of note, an S4 I purchased seems to have the issue where you move your hand anywhere near the top of the screen and it shuts down the screen - think it might be a hardware issue, but could be a software issue related to shutting the screen off when making phone calls that is doing the same thing in other applications.....Any rate, this phone came in new packaging, looks and feels brand new, and has some really great features compared to my old S3. The phone's operating system takes up about 4 Gigs, which appears to be standard, but it did some really helpful things automatically like changing my phone storage and picture storage preferences to my micro SD card and asking if I wanted to keep that setting. Battery charges fully in 1-2 hours depending on how low you drain it. I typically will charge once it gets to 10-20%, but even when it was down to 5-7% it charged in no more than 2 hours. Plugging the charger into the phone in the dark is a task, but I'm hoping the wireless charging kit I bought will alleviate that issue.I only gave this 4 stars because it's way too early to give it 5 stars. If all is well after a month or two, it will be well deserving of 5 stars.",17,5

Samsung,"a nightmare - I have ordered factory unlocked device and I got a locked phone - nobody takes responsibility , no one at any support is willing to help and provide the code is needed to unlock the sim card",10,1
Samsung,"Initial Review 1. Build - Hardware: The build quality of S6 is top notch, if not better, then as good as the iphone. The photos in the website or in the samsung portal do not do justice to the actual look and feel of the phone. There are reviews that mention the s6 look similar to iphone 6 and I would agree to that. I moved from an S3 to S6. The S3 after 3 years of use, had become slow, but moving the same apps to S6, the apps worked seemlessly. 2. Screen: The 577 pixels per inches is pixel density results in a screen with crisp displays and super sharp and smooth images. 3. Software: The android build on the S6 has so far run smoothly for past 3 months and so has all the apps I have used so far. 4. Camera: I havent played around with the photo as much as the video. The video on this is just incredible.4K ultra-HD video. The color reproductions are like something out of Downtown Abbey.Yes, the battery life on a single charge is nothing to talk about. I get a whole days use. The upside is that the phone comes with a super charger that charges the phone to 90% within 30 minutes or so.Long time Review1-Month: We end up finding some new feature every time we use it.i. GPS navigator - We used S6 as a navigator while travelling to New York. Compare the 60's cartoon screen of an Garmin with 577 ppi screen of S6 and you willl understand why you WANT to use S6 as a navigator even if you dont need to. Google maps has an offline mode, as long as you have enough storage on your phone to download the maps of the location. The best part was that during navigation, an incoming call, would just should up as a smally rectangular bar with information about the caller and accept/decline button and at the same time, the navigation would still be displayed.ii. Finger Print unlock. Setting up is a breeze. there was a bit of apprehension whether if it will work. For one, the fingerprint unlock worked every time, the first time and again, there is a backup password (in case finger print doesnt work)6 month review:i. iphone6 and 6s have come and gone and after comparing the S6 to iphones my vote is for S6.ii. S6 continues to work without issues. The phone accidently dropped from 5 ft and there was no scratch on it - I did have a protective cover.",94,5

Samsung,Well I received my phone today and by reading the reviews last night I was extremely worried so when my phone came I checked my phone step by step based on the reviews. for example: 1. The package/seal was NOT broken. 2. It was UNLOCKED. 3. Phone language was in ENGLISH. 3. My phone is a REAL Samsung S6. 4. Phone works GREAT on Cricket network. 5. My camera front and back WORKS GREAT. So based on the reviews I did NOT experienced non of that (THANK GOD) I LOVE MY NEW PHONE.....,29,5

Samsung,"LET THE BUYER BEWARE. This phone had already been formatted for SPANISH and certain security options (Knox) were uninstalled. Hardware was damaged, too.

Samsung,"MISLEADING. There is NO DISCLAIMER that this phone has to be unlocked using AN AMERICAN SIM CARD before you can switch to an international carrier. The device description says that it will work with ALL GSM carriers; however, when you get the device there is a warning inside the box that the device must be used for a total of five minutes with an American sim card before it can be fully unlocked. THIS IS NOT STATED ON AMAZON.VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON'S LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.",19,1
Samsung,"The Galaxy itself is an awesome looking phone with possibly the best display out currently. The colors are vibrant and the camera is excellent. The platinum gold is very unique and it seems to change colors depending on lighting - silver or gold. It's very slippery, but the dual glasses makes it feel premium. The performance is smooth as well. The phone itself is 5 stars. The one I received however is a 1 star due to the front glass panel being tilted. And yes, please read the critical reviews about the factory seals being broken or nonexistent. Mine came with no factory seal, just a one sided sticker that contained a barcode and place of origin. And please read their policies, because some of them are ridiculous. If you get this phone from the wrong seller, you will be screwed. I have a suspicion some sellers are actually selling refurbished (or phones that has been fixed) phones as brand new. All I can say from my experience, beware of WWD. Other than that, the phone is awesome, just be cautious.",15,1
Samsung,"My last Samsung phone was an S2 Plus. Disappointing battery barely lasted 6 hrs, this phone's (S6 Active) battery life reminds me of those days.

Samsung,"Im very disappointed. This seller gives you only the real phone. Fake headphones. Fake charger. Thats right. You guys have to open your eyes and look closer at the headsets, those are counterfeit replicas. They rattle when you move them and sound quality is terrible. I compared them to a genuine real headphone my dad has and realized that these have holes that are bigger and the samsung print is very weak. Comes off with single scratch.

If you want to contact me, send an e-mail, or send me a phone where I can call.",107,4
Samsung,"I don't know what some of these negative comments are talking about. No this isn't a scam, I received the g925F not the I (the F for international, the I for the India version. Although both have the EXACT same specs.) and the box doesn't have extra letters.... I must say, being a die hard iOS girl, that this is a nice phone. The screen is beautiful, it's android so you have to know it's not as simple (they have a toggle for a simpler version which I have yet to try), it's very presonisable. I was able to easily connect to my iPhone and transfer everything over, and when I say everything I mean everything! They matched my apps and if they didn't have the exact one they found one that was similer, freaking great option. Now for the people complain about battery life? WELCOME to the smart phone world, you wanted a mini TV screen that can multitask and be able to power a s*** ton of apps and keep up with what everyone is doing on facebook, twitter, myspace, tumbr and IG then yes the battery's suck. When you first get this phone you are going to sit there and program it to death, tweak everything to your liking. So the first week yeah your battery life is going to suck even more than normal. So androids I don't care which one has a s*** ton of apps that stay on in the back ground. So the apps with the screen saps your battery. So now you have two ways to fix this: a. Figure out to how to toggle all the apps from running in the background yourself which means you have to check up on them, or b. Download a app that does that exact thing for you such as juice defender or such like (no it doesn't turn off your fb no worries your gossip will come to you). Now with that being said the battery life and the way the phone is built has nothing to do with this seller. Why are you rating someone a horrible rate when it wasn't them who built the phone in their backyard?What you need to know when buying from this seller:* Crazy fast delivery, man got here super quick.* the phone was in it's box sealed and came with an American adapter for the charger.* the product works and works well. I bought it for cricket and works great. No damage.* Would I suggest you buy this phone coming from an iPhone? Yes! I like it, I definitely don't regret switching.* Would I suggest you buy it from this seller? Yes I gave the seller 5 stars. Awesome and would buy a phone again from them in the future.",47,5

Samsung,"Third time is a charm! FINALLY I got what I paid for, after returning two suspicious devices!DEVICE No. 1:So... I ordered this Galaxy S6 Edge for my girlfriend as her birthday gift. I did not want to purchase it through a carrier, so I got the G925F model, knowing it won't be covered by Samsung's warranty because it's a global version. However, when I received the phone, I couldn't help but think it has been opened. As you can see in my picture, the original Samsung seal has been cut open (clean cut) and then a new sticker was on top of that to cover that up. I thought I saw two stickers, but when my girlfriend lifted the first one, the second one at the bottom was revealed and we could immediately see that the case has been opened. Even thought this was sold at a ""NEW"" device, my girlfriend felt like it has been opened previously and she did not want to keep anything that was suspicious. I purchased the first one from WIRELESS PLACE. I contacted the seller, asking for explanation and the seller just said I was accusing him/her and basically provided no explanation. I left a seller feedback, and Amazon immediately deleted it saying they fulfilled the order and it wasn't the seller's fault. However, how is Amazon responsible for an item when it was supplied like that by the seller? I don't get it. Anyhow - I was able to return the first device. I do not recommend Wireless Place at all.DEVICE No. 2:Because we returned the first one, now my girlfriend was sad because she didn't have the gift on her birthday. I immediately ordered a second one, this time from SHOPEBEST. This time, before I placed the order I reached out to the seller and asked specifically, ""I have purchased it from another seller and the seal was tampered with- is your device 100% brand-new, never been opened?"" and the seller confirmed the device was a brand-new device and it's never been opened. So I was confidant in my purchase and ordered it from this seller and I thought everything was good to go....Well, we received the device from Shopebest, and there were a few things that were wrong with this order. First, the seller said it was G925I model (very confidant seller, guaranteed it was the i model) but the one we received was G925F model. We did not complain at all about this - just thought the seller did not keep good track of what they were selling. Because the F model has more LTE bands, it was a plus.However, the case had a problem..... it did not have the Samsung seal on the short side of the box, it was just put on the box, rather randomly, on the long side of the box and it wasn't even straight. Also, my girlfriend opened it up and checked the phone, and guess what? The OS was already upgraded to 5.1.1!!!!!!!!!! That means someone has opened it, used it, and upgraded the phone to the latest OS. And even if you reset the phone to factory setting, you can't uninstall the OS (without rooting the phone). So we had our suspicion, but wanted to make sure and check with Samsung before we make false accusations. So we e-mailed Samsung UAE (the phone said it was from UAE) and received the following answers.An excerpt from the email we received from the Samsung UAE agent (what is in the parenthesis is my question):(1. Where on your S6 Edge box do you place the Samsung warning seal that says _quotdo not accept if this seal has been broken_quot? Is it the top or bottom, or the sides where it''''s longer in length?)""For your inquiry, Samsung Gulf Electronics supply all Mobile phones to two Authorized distributors in UAE (Eros & Axiom) and you can find two Samsung seal placed on the device box at the narrow sides then the distributor seal placed on four or two sides of the device box after packing using transparent plastic.""(2. What Android OS did this come out of the factory? If a phone is straight from the factory, should it have OS 5.0.1 or 5.1.1?)""Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (Gulf model) come with Android Lollipop 5.0.1""(3. Based on my IMEI number, do I have the 925F model or is this a 925I model?)""We have verified the IMEI number and found that the device having the market code of UAE the model number is SM-G925F.""So there you go, we now know for sure that it wasn't exported by an authorized dealer and also the seal was not put on the longer side of the case by Samsung - they always put it on the short side. I knew about this because I have purchased Galaxy phones before from Korea, from Samsung store and they all had the ""DO NOT ACCEPT"" seal on the short sides. So we got confirmation that this device has been upgraded by someone else who has opened the box and used the phone. Of course, returned it. At this point, the only reason we were able to remain calm was the Amazon's policy and its customer service reps. It was ridiculous.DEVICE No. 3:FINALLY! I purchased the last one - was going to just go to AT&T and purchase it outright if this one had problems too - from the seller OPEN GROUP WIRELESS. As soon as we opened the package, we knew we got the real deal this time. Please refer to my images that I attached below. They have all the seals where they are supposed to be, no double seal, no misplaced / randomly placed seal, etc. This one had the Samsung seal on the short side and the dealer sticker also. We carefully examined the package and opened the box. The GF checked the phone, OS, and everything and everything was good! She is now super happy that she got the good product. We called the seller before placing this order as well, and the person who answered the phone at Open Group Wireless could not be any more rude. She was extremely rude, but we don't even care because we finally got what we paid for. The reason why we purchased from this seller is because when we asked what side the seal was, the woman said it was on the short side.Now, we are getting more information about the device through Samsung Korea customer service center (located in Suwon) to see if this was exported by authorized dealer and to trace it back to the country of origin because now the device does not say where it's from. Based on their answer, if we find anything contrary to our belief that it is a good, genuine, unused product, then I'll update the review then.I am posting this review on all three product pages.",165,1
Samsung,This phone is awsome; beautiful design beautiful screen. Plus being unlock is icing on the cake. This phone by far to me is better than the iPhone. This unlock version allows me to create mobile hot spot which AT&T restricts because of my service plan if I buy a phone from them. They will also charge you more for the same phone. I also get 100 GB of free online storage space from One drive app. AT&T bought phone does not support this.,11,5
Samsung,"The product is fine.Seller did not post that it was preloaded with special app from a carrier (not able to be removed), Android version do not include Spanish, the charger is for a europe connection with an adaptor and sometimes it does not charge.If I knew all this before buying I would not buy it at all.",39,3
Samsung,"I love this phone so much, coming from an iPhone user. I'm so infatuated with all the things I can do with it! This phone amazes me! The quality and shortcuts it provide! Not to mention the camera quality on this phone is superb.The one thing I was worried about on this phone was the battery life, I been reading reviews about it and I have also noticed battery life like losing about 2-6% in between 5 mins of just browsing on Facebook, But medium to normal use will get you through the whole day. My phone has not died on me yet and I'm also planning on using a power bank or a charging case for it.This phone is just too good to give up for an iPhone 6 it has way better features while leaving apple in the dust.Great phone overall! Came in a sealed box with fast charger and earphones, Gold is simply beautiful! Took me a couple days to genuinely call it mine with debating on if the battery life would be a problem or not. I took the phone off the charger around 4:30pm and it is 2:14am with 62% batterylife with about 11 hours left on my phone! It's all about preferences and a little bit of sacrifices. Overall this is an amazing phone and I'm gonna go with my gut feeling on this :D",30,4
Samsung,I am pleased to say that I received my phone one day before it was due to arrive. Phone is perfect and works well. Anyone in the caribbean who is thinking of buying this phone you can go right ahead. I am from St Lucia and it works perfectly with both Digicel and Lime.,29,5
Samsung,"The Emerald Green is absolutely beautiful and a must have for green lovers out there. Its a sexy, subtle, classy color not an ostentatious one, I have no problem carrying it with me to a business meeting. Ladies it fits in a curvaceous back pocket with a little hanging out with no troubles. You MUST get a case unless you don't mind fingerprints and potential damage.I'm a long time HTC girl and got the phone to try something new. The display - there aren't words for it, just stunning. Camera is worth the switch. I'm using the camera and video to capture my nieces first steps - all the pics and videos look amazing.I do prefer HTC Sense over Touchwiz but not enough to make me settle for an HTC atm in comparison. Touchwiz is just awkward to me and I'm still trying to tell if its because I'm coming from Sense or if it really is just awkward.On an Android you have access to plenty of add ons - games entertainment etc - supplied by Samsung, Amazon and Google Play (I have no idea why someone would want an iPhone). For the S6 Edge there are Samsung apps customized for it including a bunch of apps that can run along the edge called ""Edge Specials"". The Samsung Theme store...blew me away, so many good looking themes for free and a small fee but they REALLY bring out the phones vibrant screen. The one I have active atm allows me to play with the center image - totally comes in handy during those moments of boredom or when riding an Uber.Seller comments: shipped on time, received on time, original packaging but warranty card was removed in comparison to store bought versions, Phone and all accessories were in 100% good shape, clean ESNs and valid IMEIs,",23,4

Samsung,"Did a lot of research before making my purchase. Great phone with outstanding style but one thing that got me worried was the startup of the phone, it didn't start up like a new phone would so it got me thinking that ""wireless everything"" might have sold me a used one. Also I checked the phone app and it shows 2 calls made on this phone. For me I'll keep it as it looks brand new with no scuffs but just keep that in mind when purchasing through Amazon.",65,3

The list of accepted countries is Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, UAE, Western Sahara, Yemen. Apparently Amazon has already had several complaints about this, but doesn't care about putting this in the description of this phone. I was told by the Customer care representative herself that I should go on and put a negative review here on this item so that people will find out about this particular issue with this phone and it will help them !!. Also, apparently Amazon has no policy about the description/specifications of items (including this phone) on the website that are shipped by Amazon, let alone by third parties.",15,1
Samsung,"Excellent. This was a replacement of the same phone. My previous s6 edge plus took a drink and all of the retailers don't even sell the s6 anymore because they are pushing the s7, I like the Samsung phones but I was stuck because they don't make a s7 edge plus and I don't think the regular s7 edge is wide enough. The Note 7's are catching fire and recalled and s8 edge plus doesn't come out until Feb 2017. I didn't want to pay 760 for the s7 when I'd rather wait for the s8 in a few months. I still owe 576 of the original phone so paying that off and starting over on a s7 didn't sound good. I really like the s6 edge plus I just wished it had 2 missing features. 1) microSD 2) water proof.My other option was to make the jump to iPhone but I'd want the iPhone 7 plus and it doesn't come out for another month. It's just a bad time to need a new phone.I ordered the phone at 10am and it was at my door at 6pm same day. I simply put my SIM card in and bam I'm up and running just like nothing happened to my original phone. All of my contacts and text history populated. I did have to charge it and let the software updates run through but it was done pretty quick.I'm very happy with the phone, I didn't even know I could buy phone's like this on Amazon. I was feeling like the man had his thumb on my head forcing me to the s7. I'll never buy from retail shops again even if they offer Zero percent interest, I like half the cost!",10,5

Would definitely recommend purchasing.Works with straight talk, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. All you need is a SIM card that is compatible for this particular phone, but those only cost around $6.00.",14,5
Samsung,"Gorgeous. gorgeous phone. I am so in love with the color it's not even funny. However, since this is an international version it does not come with/is not compatible with some features released in the US. For example, it does not have Samsung pay and Swype (keyboard function). Additionally, I took it to 2 T-Mobile stores here in CA and they could not get it working on their network. They said it was not compatible. As much as it pains me to give up such a promising phone, I have to return it.I was able to mess around with the phone before resetting it and packing it up. It is extremely light weight. The screen was responsive and the phone seemed to process the basic pre-installed apps well. Unfortunately I was not able to download any games or other apps to test.According to the posted information and questions this phone should work with T-Mobile. If you are a TM customer and would like to give this phone a shot anyway, be aware that it is not a TM phone and will not have TM features. It does not have WiFi Calling, or the TM account apps.",10,4

Samsung,"The phone is great! However I was very upset to open the package only to realise that it was not factory unlocked, as indicated by the seller. To compound issues, I am not in the US and can't even return for a different handset. Do not purchase if you are NOT in the US or in the Americas.",12,3
Samsung,"I wish people would not slam a product and skew the ratings without doing their homework before buying. Since it appears that isn't going to happen, I have done the homework for you, and I will give you the exact references to verify for yourself. This will be a long review, and I hope it will encourage those who take the time to understand what they are buying to go ahead with this phone, because if used properly, it is amazing. I am far from a ""techie"", so I'm writing this in layman's terms everyone should be able to understand.First and foremost, THIS EXACT MODEL (SM-G920TZKAXAR) IS THE ONLY FACTORY CERTIFIED UNLOCKED GALAXY S6 WITH U.S. WARRANTY THAT SAMSUNG OFFERS! Don't believe it? Check Samsung's own website. In fact, this is the only factory certified unlocked Galaxy that Samsung offers at all in the US market, and only in the 32GB version, NO OTHER COLOR, NO OTHER SIZE MEMORY, NO OTHER ANYTHING. If you purchased ANY other model it is NOT Samsung certified unlocked, you will probably not be able to register it or have the warranty, no matter what the seller may claim! Amazon may ""fulfill"" other models, but they are being sold by a third party.Now, for the model #s, what they mean, and who they work with. Don't trust the descriptions provided by the 3rd party sellers. If it says ""sold by _____ and fulfilled by Amazon"" it's a 3rd party seller. Only if it says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"" is it really sold by Amazon:This model I am reviewing will work on any carrier who utilizes GSM technology and towers. This means T-mobile, AT&T, and any other independent carrier piggybacking off these GSM towers. It will work with Straight Talk wireless, but you MUST purchase the GSM SIM card kit, NOT the CDMA version. If you purchase the right SIM card from Straight Talk, it will work fine, as they piggyback off all towers and the towers your phone will use just depends on which type phone and technology you have. This model will NOT work with Verizon or Sprint, they utilize CDMA technology and towers. I don't know why people are slamming this phone for this as it clearly states this in the description. Buyers need to check with the carrier they want to use (if not using one of the big 4) and find out which towers they will be utilizing before making a phone purchase. To do otherwise is irresponsible on the part of the buyer, and not the phone or the carrier's fault. Stop blaming them!The locked version of this model is optimized for use with T-mobile (hence the T after the SM-G920 in the model number). If you purchase a model that starts with SM-G920A, that phone is optimized for use with AT&T and is NOT a factory certified unlocked phone and will not have the US warranty. It will be sold by a 3rd party. If your phone model has a ""V"" after the 920 in the model, it is CDMA and optimized for use on Verizon. It will not have the US factory warranty and will be sold by a 3rd party. If your model has a ""P"" after the 920 it is CDMA and optimized for use on Sprint, no warranty, sold by 3rd party. US Cellular optimized phones will have an ""R"", no warranty, sold by 3rd party. With an ""I"" means international, never meant for US market, no warranty, sold by 3rd party. Get the idea??? Don't believe it? CHECK SAMSUNG'S WEBSITE!I for one did my homework, made sure I got a true certified factory unlocked phone with US warranty (sold by and fulfilled by Amazon), and knew which carrier I wanted to use. I personally wanted T-mobile as they have numerous no contract plans to choose from, excellent customer service and brick and mortar stores you can walk right into for help, so this was a perfect match. I purchased this phone along with the wireless charger, and bought the correct T-mobile SIM card. It all arrived in perfect condition, sealed package, clearly brand new and never opened.Rather than attempt to activate this phone myself or do it over the phone with a rep., I simply took everything right to my local T-mobile store and asked them to do it for me. The phone I was using was nearly 4 years old, an antiquated model and I wanted to port my old number, all my contacts, photos, etc., from my old phone to the new one. The SIM card from the old phone was also not compatible with this new one. They were completely different sizes. I was out the door in literally less than 10 minutes with a perfectly functioning phone and every single file, photo and bit of data I wanted to keep right there on the new phone (they transferred everything through cyberspace). They were only too happy to accomodate me, because after all, I will be on their network and paying for their service. They told me I didn't even need to have purchased the SIM card, they would have given it to me for free because, again, their network, their service, their revenue. Once activated, I had it registered on the Samsung website and warranty activated within 5 more minutes, right from my new phone while sitting in the car in the T-mobile parking lot. They would have probably even done that for me had I asked. Will every carrier do that for you? Probably not, that's why you should check with the carrier you want to use before doing the BYOP (bring your own phone) thing.I did everything right, and I have a flawlessly performing phone that will do things I could only previously imagine. The transition was not only painless, but downright pleasant. I could not be happier. Since activating the phone I have loaded Microsoft Office, Samsung Pay, Square Register and numerous other apps, and still flawless performance. You need to understand that when you want the most advanced technology and you want to use your phone to do all the ""newest"" things, there may be bugs from time to time. Most of the bugs are in the apps themselves, not just Samsung's apps, but everybody's apps. Just uninstall them already! Reinstall them when they become more stable. Sometimes when a brand new app does a huge update, your version may hang up. Uninstall it and reinstall the updated (fixed the bugs) version. It really is simple as that people.Does the phone come with some useless stuff? Sure it does, don't they all? Just go in and disable them. Don't know how? It would behoove you to download the user manual, free from Samsung. You will find all kinds of great things this phone will do within those pages. I've had this phone for several weeks and I'm still finding amazing things this phone will do.So.......Pros: Blazing fast processor, fabulous camera, good battery life if you take the time to optimize your settings. Crystal clear display, loads of features, lots of available accessories. Will run numerous apps at once with no detectable slow down. Connects to wi-fi flawlessly, both at home and when out using others. Stays connected, does not drop. Syncs flawlessly with other products. Wireless charger works like a dream, even though a protective case. No problems with fingerprint reader or touch screen, etc., etc., etc. There isn't enough time to list them all.Cons: I didn't buy it sooner. I could have been enjoying it earlier. As for the phone, none that I've seen yet.Finally...no, I do not work for either Samsung or T-mobile.",79,5
Samsung,"Disclaimer: I have no issue with the phone features, etc. - mostly because I haven't been able to use it. This receives 3 stars because this phone is primarily designed for T-Mobile, NOT AT&T (and, yes, I understand that had I done even more research, maybe I would've seen this, but you'll notice Amazon currently is no longer selling this item due to customer complaints).The model is model: SM-G920T...the ""T"" in this case stands for T-Mobile. I discovered after purchasing 2 of these (one for my wife) that it's not compatible with AT&T. Without a super thorough understanding of the background tech, it looks like this model isn't compatible with all of the different AT&T bands.We've tried replacing the SIM card, we've been to the AT&T store two times and they can't get it to connect to 4G or their signal at all. My wife's phone does actually connect at times (mine wouldn't at all), but half the time she cannot receive calls and it's taken me up to 6(!) tries to get the phone to ring when I call her. Needless to say, we'll be returning these phones.The model # compatible with AT&T is SM-G920A (instead of ""T"").",43,3
Samsung,"Just tried to register the product today. Confirmed that I ordered the US version for the order. However I received an international version which I cannot register with Samsung. The phone itself is very nice, but cannot get any support for it. Will be contacting Amazon by phone.",43,2
Samsung,I have received phone which is not made by Samsung.When I called Samsung for technical issue they said that IMEI number doesn't exist.As soon u buy mobile call Samsung and get it verified.,12,1
Samsung,This product is refurbished with parts from who knows where. They are not legit parts. The screen went out within 2 months. Turned blue. Return request was denied and it cannot be repaired.If you purchased this good luck. Maybe you will get a good one. But it should be illegal to scam people into paying hundreds of dollars for junk products like this.,11,1
Samsung,The phone works perfectly and will work with metroPCS LTE for anyone who wants to know.,33,5
Samsung,got the phone to work with 4g with straight talk. im loving the phone. cheaper to buy here than from at&t or bestbuy. this is a legit phone.,30,5
Samsung,"This Phone is Lite, Fast, crystal clear screen and voice. Plus easy to use. I have vision and hearing loss. This Phone is great for people like me when set up to Easy mode. Battery life is outstanding, add wireless charging, no cables to mess with, just pick it up and talk! YES! I Am Blown away to say the least! Lastly my iPhone friends have all fallen in Love with it. Added a clear case from Amazon real Wow factor. Buy this Phone!",12,5
Samsung,Great deal sim phone that is excellent in every way shape and form. Love that I can easily switch between the two sims and both are always active and capable of receiving text and phone calls. Stellar device and features.A+ seller with great items.,13,5
Samsung,"I purchased this phone to replace my Google Nexus 4. Though I was happy with the Nexus phone, after nearly 3 years the battery appeared to be deteriorating. Google's new phone offering is much larger and I didn't want what amounts to a Phablet. The Samsung Galaxy S6 is only slightly longer and very thin and light. The camera is superior to my old Nexus. Apps are simple and easy to locate and adjust. So far, the battery life is quite good, but I'm usually using only basic text, phone and minimal data programs.My biggest concern was whether an ""international"" dual sim card phone would be compatible with my existing StraightTalk prepaid plan in Illinois. I ordered my new NANO SIM card and got the phone up an running without a problem. Originally, I struggled with getting the phone to receive data, which is included in my carrier plan. After an unsuccessful call to StraightTalk tech support, I realized the problem wasn't due to inaccurate APN settings, but because I had not selected the installed SIM card in the settings/SIM card manager option.The dual SIM card feature in this phone is pretty cool. You can easily purchase a prepaid international SIM card if needed, and use the phone abroad. Then you have the option of toggling back and forth between SIM cards whenever necessary.",16,5
Samsung,"As my name suggests, I am a college student so I mostly use my phone for texting, Facebook, Instagram and other social media. Thus I would say I'm not an intensive user of all of the phone's features. I also do not play any games on it as I prefer to use my iPad for that. That way I keep my phone's storage pretty much at less than 50%. I switched from a Galaxy SII the T-989 version two weeks ago and have never looked back. I had a 16GB microSD card on my old phone and at first was wary of not having an option for expandable storage but soon realized since the Galaxy S6 has 32GB of storage that's more than enough for me and my daily needs. Thus, the non-removal battery and lack of the microSD slot is a non-issue to me.This phone is certainly a huge upgrade for me, basically everything is different about it. My personal favorite features are the LED light which my previous phone lacked, the fingerprint scanner, and the fact that I am able to reply to a text message from any app because there are pop up notifications. Previously, I wanted to switch to the iPhone because it had those notification features like pop-up notifications and notifications on the lock screen but now that the Galaxy S6 has those too I no longer feel the need for an iPhone. As previously mentioned, I do not use my phone extensively so I've had no issues with it so far. It is smooth, responsive and fast. I haven't any issues with apps crashing or the phone freezing (knock on wood!). I also really enjoy the battery life. With my previous phone I would have to charge it twice in one day if I used it constantly, thus I resorted to using airplane mode to salvage my battery life. With this phone, I charge it every other day if I let it go from 100% to 5%. It also charges very quickly. 1 hour at the charger without using it can get me somewhere between 20-40% extra life (I haven't paid very careful attention to how much I get from an hour).As far as the design and the exterior goes. It is not as gold as I had expected. It's definitely not as flashy gold as the iPhone but I still like it. The phone is thin and light weight and took maybe a day or two to get used to from my previous phone. I do have a clear case on it from Best Buy which protects everything it needs to protect and has a good grip. I also noticed that the screen is less fingerprint prone because I can easily wipe it with a shirt or my pant leg and all my fingerprints are gone.Also, I bought this phone from the seller SHOPEBEST and there was absolutely no hassle. With Prime shipping the phone was in my hand in 2 days as promised. THERE WAS NO BROKEN SEALS OR DAMAGE TO THE BOX. The phone is international so I was expecting a foreign charger, my phone is from the UK which I am actually thankful for. It IS the model SM-G920F. Everything was in the box, the little thing to open the SIM slot, the headphones, all the little booklets of information, and the UK charger with an American adapter. The phone was in perfect condition, no scratches or little nicks. I have Walmart Family Mobile as my service provider and I had no issue switching my service from my old microSIM to the nanoSIM. It took maybe 5 minutes on the phone and 15 minutes later my service switched and the phone worked like a breeze. My 4G is also working perfectly. I ran a speed test on my old phone prior to the switch and on this phone and this phone has much faster download and upload speeds. I am attaching screenshots of the speed test results from the SpeedTest app as well as pictures of the phone.",56,5
Samsung,"The phone is beautiful, however this review is specifically about this unlocked version of the Samsung Galaxy S6. I had the hardest time trying to get a network connection on this phone. I took it to the corporate store of my service provider (Metro PCS) and even they couldn't tell me why I couldn't get a network connection. Luckily the people there could refered me to someone who worked in the vicinity and knew about unlocking cell phones. He told me that because this is an International phone he had to install extra things on it to get it working. I have a 4G connection, not LTE. My guy told me LTE isn't capable on an International phone. So beware the extra steps you will have to take to get this phone working like it's supposed to. Despite that, now that I have a connection I do love it. Besides, there's really no difference between 4G and LTE.",11,3
Samsung,My samsung s6 was clearly opened and blocked with TAG I can't access internet or google play without a user and a password!!!,26,1
Samsung,"My amazon prime box came in completely sealed. Inside there was the Galaxy S6 box looking normal but the seal was broken once I took off the slip-on covering. I found this weird but I didn't realize what this meant until I opened the box and everything seemed fine except there was no phone. Instructions manual, check. USB cord and charging dock, check. Weird metal loop thing to get the SIMs card slot out, check. Headphones, check. Phone? Not so much. I'm currently contacting Amazon about getting a refund but you can bet I'll be more cautious before ordering phones on Amazon again (this is the first time this has happened and the first time I've tried ordering a phone online). I'm not saying this can happen to you, but I was pretty pissed when I saw this and now I'm definitely going to a store and buying it in person.",13,1
Samsung,"I have read many reviews who h say that the phone gets a weaker signal than the at&t or the T-Mobile version of the phone which S are me a little but I decided to buy the phone anyway. I got the phone and I compared it's signal with my S6 Edge at&t version and this international version did show less bars but I believe it's because it's programmed slightly differently but the strength of the signal is the same if not better. I noticed that is some places where my at&t version couldn't load stuff because of a weak signal this international version loaded it my much better, also the phone came with the factory seal untouched, no fake one on top of it",19,5
Samsung,"I normally go back and forth between Apple and Android but I started a new job so I bought the Samsung Galaxy s6 as a means of new efficiency. I think its great so far.PRO1. Great UI. There are many things the user can control to his/her preferences which is a huge plus. Finger print password, managing apps, shortcuts, etc.2. Great color and clarity of screen. Good use of large screen without feeling bulky.3. Functionality. Works well with 4G. I've use Apple for most of my professional life and I can't believe how flawless and seamless the Android system functions. It hasn't crashed despite the memory-hogging, data-centric apps I use - unlike my previous iPhone.CON1. One annoying thing was that my SIM card did not originally fit so I had to go to my local mobile store and get it cut - no charge ofcourse, but they did seem surprised that a new SIM did not come with the package as it seemed the norm. But that was a small inconvenience to bear.",18,5
Samsung,Thanks for the cellphone. Though it took time trying to get a prepaid US carrier to work but it works well.,17,5
Samsung,"The phone is very nice -- not too many bloatware, lightning fast, sleek, except, as reported in many places, the battery is not long lasting. On the other hand, the charging speed is superior -- less than 80 mins from 0% to 100% with the adaptive fast charger.The one start I'm not giving is for the phone not straight from factor. Claimed by the seller in the reply to my inquiry email as ""factory sealed straight from the manufacturer"", and in another email where I complained not true after getting it ""verified that there was not usage on this unit prior to it arriving to you"". But I still believe this is not true. Before opening the box, I saw a smaller factory seal (broken) covered by a larger one. After opening it, I immediately noticed a fingerprint on the phone protecting wrapper. I didn't return it because this was the 2nd time (returned once to another seller) and no longer wanted a 2nd long wait -- certainly, I checked the CPU/memory/SoC etc. to be the same as S6 specs before making the decision.In sum, this is an almost ideal phone. Buy it from stores if possible.",17,4
Samsung,"Being an Iphone lover, I was bit apprehensive earlier to switch to Samsung for it's hot selling product. After one week of using it, I have completely fallen for this one. It actually justifies of being the 'latest' mobile gadget available in the market and it gives you every bit of it. Few points which make this one a must buy:SUPERB Gaming experience : I just couldn't stop myself from downloading a couple of games and the playing experience has been fantastic.UNBEATABLE Camera : Just give a cluck shot and you will fall for this one.DOESN'T HANG UP: Yes you heard it right,Get ready for a flawless experience.MARVELLOUS looks: This device feels so sleek in hand, for those who want performance and looks, this one is certainly the best steal.",16,5
Samsung,"I ordered the International model of the Samsung S6 from Surge Telecom. It took a while to arrive. The box states the phone is an international model, but there is a sticker attached that says it only accepts American SIMS.You have to peel off the sticker to read""American SIM Card Only: This product is only compatible with SIM-card issued from a mobile operator within the Americas (The North, South and Central Americas and the Caribbean)."" There is a warning about the phone not working if an attempt is made to activate with a SIM card from another region - it will have to be reset by Samsung.I needed a true international telephone for use in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. This phone will not work for me. I am sending it back.",10,1
Samsung,"I've previously owned the Galaxy s3 for 2 years and I decided it was time for an upgrade. I bought this phone Refurbished and the phone came in brand new! sealed and in its original package with the charger and ear buds and SIM tool. I'm a full-time student and part-time worker so i most of the time keep my phone on Ultra power saving mode during class and work and when i get home 4 pm I still have 50% of battery or more. The Phone is definitely an upgrade for me. this phone is twice the generation of my previous phone. Whether or not you need this phone and is worth the cost is up to you. Camera is amazing, very sharp those 16 mega pixels don't disappoint. Fingerprint sensor recognizes your finger pretty easily,never had an issue with it. I also love how fast it is when you press the home button twice to open the camera it literally takes a second or less. Also i hope you take care of your phones because this phone has a glass back with a camera protruding out of it so be careful. I recommend getting a case ASAP. Although you can take care of your phone no problem it's still good to have a case just in (case)lol you might drop it one day since it is a slippery phone. Display is very crisp and beautiful. Also to help you fix that little problem with the button lights for the galaxy s6 next to the home button. Get the app called Galaxy button lights to control that feature because the settings do not include that option to change the duration of the lights or to turn them off permanently. - K bye!",12,5
Samsung,Got the phone and it was stolen T-Mobile put a lock on it and said its jail broken and not even a real T-Mobile phone also bank information was stolen from phone as well DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON ITS A SCAM!!!!! also I filed an a to z claim,16,1
Samsung,"I'm happy with my phone. I decided to take a risk and buy this refurbished phone instead of spending almost $700 on the Galaxy 7, which seems ridiculous. I researched the sellers and this seller had lots of positive reviews. The phone arrived, looking brand new, and it works like a new phone also. So far, so good.",11,5
Samsung,"Samsung Galaxy S6 (SM-G920V) - 32GB Verizon + GSM Smartphone - Black Sapphire (Certified Refurbished)So inserting a product link, since if you search for Galaxy S6 for Verizon and are looking at the refurbished ones, this one and the one linked are the top two. One of the sellers sells on both of them, and this one is slightly cheaper by about $20. I guess this is where they sell their duds.So first and foremost...this is not ""refurbished"" in the way you would expect. Lots of scratches. On the back, the camera lens, the home button, by the sim tray, and below near the charging port/speaker. I have no idea what the heck the last person did to this thing, but there are way too many scratches for anyone to sell this as ""certified refurbished"". Very used at best.Now I was thinking about this for a while and thought ""Maybe this is the standard with these guys.."". Then I got to the camera...Upon launching the camera I heard this incredibly obnoxious noise, from what I assume is the camera module on the back ""trying"" to focus, but apparently never does. I've never heard a phone make a noise this loud though from focusing. Something is very wrong with it. Almost every photo comes out blurry, because it never finishes focusing. Whoever did the repair on it or decided to pass the buck and thought ""hey..no one will everrrr take photos with this anyway."", should be reprimanded. Not cool.Anyway this is going back. I've bought used and refurbished stuff before, and that's usually not a problem. But for something costing several hundred dollars, they could have spent maybe more than 60 seconds trying out some basic functionality first.TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read): Phone itself is a great phone. The seller? Not so much. Don't but refurbished for this phone. Camera module is shoddy and makes a lot of noise and too many scratches. Try someone else.",38,2
Samsung,"This is my second s6. Ruined the original last summer while submerged in the Bitterroot river. Hot phone, cold river sucked the water into the phone. Replaced it with a used S5. Got a good deal(this one) on a refurbished phone. The phone looked brand new, no scratches and works perfectly. The S6 is the ultimate smartphone, a finished product. I enjoy being outdoors and running long distances while listening to music. The display is excellent and you can see it in direct sunlight. I use my Garmin 235 with the Garmin Connect software on the phone which turns out to be the perfect combination for outdoor sports. The camera takes great photo's and it is fast. Video is excellent. They have an improved sensor for heartrate, oxygen and stress. Unlike the prior S5, the sensor displays a sine wave and seems to be consistent and accurate. The glass and metal is a beautiful combo and feels expensive in your hand. I used an Otter Box on my destroyed S6, while it provides excellent shock resistance, it is not water proof. Water will destroy this phone, more so than any electronic device I have used in the past.. I purchased a S6 Waterproof Case, Caka [Newest Version] Full-body Underwater Waterproof, for my S6 when I am near water or when it is raining. the battery seems to last a long time depending on how I am using it.",28,5
Samsung,"This phone is really fast and works great. Plenty of memory and a SD slot to boot. Can install lots of apps. Cannot move apps to the SD card, unlike my Samsung Galaxy J1 dual-SIM phone.The Galaxy S7 can accept two SIMs, but the second SIM would take the place of the SD slot. That's unfortunate: You can not use the SD slot and second SIM. Either or. Thus, the four-star rating.The GPS works really well. The bluetooth works well. Wifi works well. No problems with the Android.The phone comes with a European style plug, a USB cable, a little pin to eject the SIM tray, and earphones w/mic.I tried to register the phone with the US Samsung website and Samsung did not recognize the serial number nor the IMEI numbers. I don't know if that's because the dual-SIM phone isn't out here in the USA or it's a fake phone. Of course, the listing says no warranty. Seems real and works great, anyhow.Supposedly it is water resistant, but I didn't test that.",10,4
Samsung,"Absolutely love our new phone. The international version works perfectly with our cricket service and we saved over $100 versus the US version. My research claimed that the processor of the international version is actually better than the processor that comes with the US version. I can not confirm since I only have the one, but i am completely satisfied and would recommend this phone.BONUS - It does not spontaneously catch on fire like the note7",13,5
Samsung,"I like it. As some others have pointed, I don't the 4G LTE signal ever. Not quite sure if it's the network operator issue or the phone. I can't imagine it being the phone issue. Even so I can stream Youtube videos on 4G without any issues. Compared to my old S3, S7 is a huge upgrade. Everything is faster. Network pages load so much faster than my old S3, on par with my gaming desktop.",13,5
Samsung,"The things I am satisfied:- This phone is beautiful. Honestly, I love looking at this phone and I find myself wiping down the phone to maintain it's reflective dark reflection.- Stunning display. Impressive 5.1 QHD AMOLED display is beautiful and vibrant. It's largely the same as the S6, but that's not a bad thing.- Camera has a great rear camera compared to the S6. Even though the megapixels have been reduced to 12, it has a much better sensor and takes great photos in low-light environments. It auto-focuses super quickly, so you can take pictures as quickly as you can pull up the camera app. - 3000mAh battery is like having a phone + battery case without actually having the thick battery case. Hard to kill that battery in a day. And it comes with the fast Qi charge technology which is charged from 0% to 50% in 30mins only!- Always on mode constantly displays notifications without the need to unlock the phone. - Water resistant. IP68 rated which means the phone can be totally submerged in water up to 1.5m deep and 30 minutes. - up to 128Gb Micro SD expandable memoryThe things Samsung have to improve: - Not removable battery pack. 3000mAh is not enough for a busy day. - No USB-type C so it's not future proof, but then again the lifetime of the phone is 1-2 years.- Only 32GB storage. But you can overcome this with micro-SD storage.- Dual sims function: you have to remove the micro-sd card for the sim 2, otherwise, there is no any other slot for sim2. - I am using T-mobile, the speed of LTE of the dual sims international version is very not stable and slow than the one I used on my iphone 6s GSM unlocked ver.- For some reason, my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My iphone6s had fingerprint readers and its quicker or more accurate than the S7",36,4
Samsung,"While I am generally happy with the phone overall, I did encounter a MAJOR PROBLEM with Samsung, this phone, and buying international phones in the domestic USA. The sim tray on the Galaxy S7 is incredibly cheap plastic. It broke in half - with part of the tray stuck INSIDE the SIM assembly on the phone.The Amazon ad clearly designates that there is no warranty. That's helpful to know. However, when I contacted Samsung asking for help (i.e. - LET ME PAY YOU TO FIX MY PHONE) I was told that because this was an international phone, the domestic Samsung people will not help me.So I'm left right now with a device that I cannot use (that I purchased 3 months ago) because I cannot remove the plastic component that broke inside the phone. This would typically be covered by warranty, but there is no warranty on this device. I cannot pay to get it fixed by the manufacturer because they won't touch it.So because of poor support and lack of recourse I really would not recommend anyone go the route of purchasing an international variant Samsung device in the US.",25,2
Samsung,"It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, this is the best phone I have ever tried. Slick, light, balanced, fantastic screen, fast, water proof, and so on .... its only caveat (and an important one) is the lack of removable battery (Samsung lost the removable batter starting with the S6). I like this phone much better than the Edge. The S7 Edge has a bigger screen, but the resolution is the same as with the S7, and its edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the Edge's edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case - not a problem with the regular S7.Finally, the only difference between the G930F (single sim version) and the G930FD (dual sim version) is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card, which is recognized by the device's OS.",168,3

I have not witness any Lag so far. the focusing on Camera is really good I have to say it's actually better than my DSLR. which is kinda sad. and the Quality of photos are coming out perfect especially on PRO Mode which you're able to adjust the ISO, Focus, Tint etc...Screen: far better than my LUmia 1520 I think. the AMOLED Screen is amazing plus on top of that 2k Quality.

Samsung,"Should I buy the Samsung Galaxy S7?I am speaking of the Asian version with duo slots not the north American version.I had an iphone 6s , went overseas to work for a few months I was using the iPhone 6s it worked fine , except for a 4G connection and lte use overseas , I called apple ask them what type of bug they put in their phone for limiting service providers on the speed of the Internet, they did not fix an issue which I am not going to details about an apple freak would know the problem my of the public is not aware about . Any way I did a lot of reading and research on the better phone . I came across the Samsung s7 specifically the Asian version . At first I was very hesitant about getting it , I was not convinced till I tested the phone now I am convinced it is the world's most fastest phone to surf the net .I have put up a screen shot of the proforma center and no restrictions like Apple on network speed . Now I have placed my iPhone 6s as a paper weight . There goes apple support. The fix is the Samsung s7 . Yes it works well in Africa , Asia, Europe in any network without a certifications need without carrier is not certified issue unlike like Apple.There isnƒ??t a better Android phone out there right now. The Nexus 6P comes close, but itƒ??s much larger, and the Galaxy S7 Edge is a lot more expensive. For the majority of people, Iƒ??d say the Galaxy S7 is the phone to pick.It looks great, feels a lot better than the Galaxy S6 due to the curved back, and it performs like a champ.It also has the best all-round camera on any phone, thanks to crisp images and a fuss-free app thatƒ??s fast to open, focus and shoot.Samsung has taken the Galaxy S6, an already excellent phone, and fixed just about everything wrong with it. UPDATE .. dated 28-7-2016 , if you buy this phone get a cover and a screen protector , I accidentally dropped the phone from a 2 meter escalator facing the screen head on the phone survived the fall with a single shatter on the screen , still working but the shatter is visible from an angle, I purchased a screen seal so the shatter won't spread all over , I did a search on replacing the screen , no one is willing to replace the screen due to some type of a glue on the system Board, I have to wait until a phone technicians know to prefect a replacement screen on the s7 and 7edge. I would not take the star due to my fault . Be careful not to drop the phone on a hard surface , prone to shatter if not protected !! Like any other smart phones . I did get the cracked Glass on the front replaced with no hassle . The waiting was about 3 hours at the Samsung center in bejing , it can out like new , no cracks that bothered me for a while , I had to pay for the service of replacement on the front Glass, now learned , I did get a screen protector and a solid cover . If you buy a glass shatter phone it is a must to buy the cover and glass shield.. love the phone as far as proformance and speed ..Here we go apple .. watch out ..",12,5

Called Samsung (had registered the device and everything), first they collected info on the phone and said they will call back in 24 hours. Waited a week, no call.

Samsung,"I have never bought a phone outside a carrier. That and the fact the label said International and No Warranty really had me concern. Not having ATT branding and stuff cluttering my new expensive phone was enticing though. Not having ATT block or delay my phone updates also was interesting. Having a white phone was a small but nice benefit too. So I cancel my ATT purchase and bought from Mercate Group. ATT said it would ship at the end of month, Mercate said I would have my phone by the end of month. Reality was Mercate quickly sent me my phone within a week. Did not have to pay extra for quick shipping either. When I contacted seller about warranty they said they would honor the 1 year warranty. With no sales tax through Amazon I saved $55, got my preferred phone unbranded and unlocked, quicker and cheaper than ATT. Though I must say ATT activated the phone to my GOPhone account quickly and easily with no charge either. So far I am extremely satisfied with everything regarding this purchase. As far as warranty we will have to wait and hope not to need it. Another thing is that the AC charger included has a European plug but an adapter was included, I think by Mercate,",80,5
Samsung,"This is a review for SM-G930UZKAXAA. The ONLY non-carrier based, Samsung U.S. warranted, factory unlocked phone. Too bad Amazon lumps all the 'unlocked' S7 reviews together. This was very confusing as I gradually figured out that numerous overseas and carrier based versions of the S7 exist. I won't waste time reviewing the phone itself other than the primary differences that this version has.1) - It is has both CDMA and GSM receivers optimized for the bands and channels used by U.S. carriers. In the U.S., Sprint, Verizon and U.S. Cellular use CDMA. AT&T and T-mobile use GSM. I.E. - it is theoretically compatible with any U.S. carrier allowing you to take your phone to any U.S. carrier including the pay as you go services such as Cricket, Boost, Virgin, etc. Set up flawlessly on my Cricket account.2) It does not come pre-loaded with carrier bloatware. Although Samsung does load some of its own that can't be removed. The most irritating being Samsung pay which occasionally generates popups reminding you its available.3) It is warranted by SAMSUNG with full U.S. warranty. No battery issues on the S7, but nice to know it's warranted if something similar to the Note 7 debacle happens.4) Updates are pushed out directly from Samsung. Presumably at a quicker pace than from many experience from carrier versions. I have received one update so far in 60 days.",163,5
Samsung,"(I did purchase this phone from this page and decided to do a quick review of it)This phone was everything I could have asked for. I always had this predisposition that the Samsung phones were made with lower quality materials, but I was dead wrong. This phone is Beautiful! The materials they put into it are top notch and in my personal opinion this device looks and feels much better than the iPhones!When I first got I was worried because I was switching from Apple to Android, which can be a pretty daunting change. BUT the transition did not seem to take long at all. I got into the phone pretty quickly and was doing my normal daily tasks in no time.It is sad that I had to give up FaceTime but I feel like it was worth it and my friends quickly adapted and started calling me on Skype or Oovoo instead.Unlike the name says, this phone did actually come with some type of warranty I believe. On the box there was a ""24 month warranty"" sticker,.. So I am assuming that means I have a warranty!I also was curious to see which phone is faster (the iPhone 6s Plus vs the Samsung Galaxy S7) so I ran a few easy tests. In getting into apps, the Samsung got in just a hair faster. In loading webpages, the Samsung again beat the iPhone just by a hair.The camera on the Samsung is by far the superior camera when there is ample amount of lighting but in low light, I would give it to the iPhone. The front-facing camera, works the same way. In low light the iPhone wins, but with enough light, the Samsung does better.There are many really cool customization options on the Android software that you would have to jailbreak your iPhone to do, and with the type of person I am I feel like the Android software works better for me. On the other hand, Android may be more confusing to use. Things are not always quite right there where you want them to be and you have have to search for them. BUT Android helps you out with this with search bars when they are convenient.Overall this device is everything I could have asked for. I really enjoy it and I hope I can continue enjoying it for as long as possibly",137,5
Samsung,"This ""factory unlocked international version"" came with a big sticker on the box saying it needed an American SIM card.(Update: I was lucky ƒ?? I was able to borrow a US nano-SIM from a friend, make a five-minute phone call to it, and after that the phone does seem to be working so far with my own SIM card.)",74,1
Samsung,"Are you F***** serious right now? I paid 540$ for a brand new phone and it comes with the seal broken and also the F***** box damaged. Who the hell is in charge of this, did a terrible job. You should not be selling things on Amazon. I don't even know what the hell is happening with my phone now, if they took the liberty to open it before hand.",11,1
Samsung,"The GS7 is an awesome device. However, if you're getting the international G930F, know that Samsung pay won't work and Android Pay will be limited. In addition, if you're expecting faster updates from Samsung, just know they have the G930F extremely fragmented by country and specific firmware to each country... so not all will receive updates as fast as you might expect for a ""carrier free"" device. That said, the Exynos processor on the G930F is superior to the Snapdragon processor in the US variant, as is the battery life.",11,4
Samsung,this device did not bring the Spanish language and also allows him down. the seller told me that only guarantee English . A trap,44,1
Samsung,"Software crashed five days after my replacement availability ended.The phone was just in front of me then suddenly shut down and restarted. Then it got stuck on a boot loop. And that was that.I tried everything. Even restoring to factory settings.The only thing that could work is that I need a specific firmware version from Vietnam that can't be found online (yet).Apparently, this is a common occurrence from Samsung phones. So just keep that in mind. Might be better to buy it from your service provider.",31,1
Samsung,THIS IS A US ONLY VERSION. Actually unlocking it requires you to purchase an unlock code online for an extra $30. Some reviews say you need to use a US sim before leaving the country and it will work fine. Unfortunately I left without unlocking it. The seller needs to emphasize this because this is false advertisement. The phone works fine otherwise.,30,1
Samsung,"This phone is marketed as international version, but box has a sticker that says it will only accept American SIM.",13,1
Samsung,No problems with the phone. It comes with the charger cord and ear buds. It DOES NOT come with the cord to transfer your data from old phone to new (included when purchasing a new phone). It also does not come with the little key to pop open the little compartment for internal cards--you have to use a paperclip.,11,4
Samsung,"Ordered the unlocked version for a GSM (AT&T) network, yet I received the unlocked Sprint version so I cant use any cellular data. I also did not receive any headset as well. Overall the phone was in very good condition, there was a noticeable dent on the bottom of the phone upon delivery, but seeing as how the phone was not able to be activated fully I had to return it and decided to buy a new one directly from Samsung. If you have Sprint or Verizon this may not be a bad buy, otherwise I would highly advise against it",12,2
Samsung,Phone was not unlocked as advertised. I spent over 3 hrs with AT&T workers trying to get the phone activated. Also did not come with headset as advertised.,20,1
Samsung,"I bought two of these refurbished Galaxy S7's. I've only had them less than a week. My wife's appears to be working well, but mine hangs up and needs a system reset several times a day. This happens when it is idle for a length of time - several hours. Seems OK if it is on a charger, but if left overnight off the charger it is unresponsive in the morning and needs the system reset. When it comes on it still had battery life two nights, but the battery was at 0% another night. Sometimes it hangs up during the day after being idle a few hours, even with a nearly fully charged battery. Looks like I'll have to send mine back.Also, I have a hard time typing on that touchscreen keyboard - seems I have to backspace once for every 2-3 characters I try to type. But in fairness, my grandkids seem to have far less difficulty. Maybe I'll get accustom to it.UPDATE: The day I wrote that review, I arranged to return the bad phone and buy a new one. But I did not send it back right away. That was about a week ago and I haven't experienced the problem since. The S7 had required a couple system updates - perhaps they fixed the problem. I've decided to retain the phone since then. I'll leave the score as is.",19,5
Samsung,"I just LOVE this Tablet! Its perfect! Get yours!!!!! I live in Costa Rica and calls, sms, mms, 3G internet!!! Everything works perfect!!!Thank You Samsung people, You guys created the greatest tab ever!!!!!!!!!By the way I also have an Ipad and yes.. Is dead! Galaxy killed it.",10,5
Samsung,"Great Gadget that unifies a very good tablet with the best Mobile OS (Android), a Camera (could be better than just 3.2MP) and a Phone.Recommended FULLY.",22,5
Samsung,"Awesome! Android is great, the hardware is great. Fast, easy, great.Fully unlocked - working in Sao Paulo, Brazil with TIM provider, working voice calls, 3G, HSPA+, EDGE, etc.",15,5
Samsung,"Ordered it on Friday and got delivered on Sunday...WoW! that was fast. Checked to see if its new or returned one, and it turns out to be brand new. The intial menu was in French but a quick search on you tube helped to set the language to English. Inserted an existing ATT sim card (Voice & Unlimited data) and it worked like a charm. Was able to make calls using cellular capabilites & with Wifi through Skype. The sound quality at both ends are very clear, even when I hold it 10 inches away from my face. First impression ""its good and will post more as I start using it"".",15,5
Samsung,"I am so happy that I decided to get this watch. I only wish the batterie would last longer. Everything eles it worth the money.It just stopped working. I purchased this on April 13, 2015 and it stopped working on August 17, 2015. So I paid all of this money for a 4 month watch. That just sucks bad.....I'm so sad about this.",10,1
Samsung,"The watch itself is great but consumers in the US beware of the fine print from this vendor. This particular watch is the International version which is from China. It has no warranty in the US. It does as you for a nano sim card. I went through the setup to see if it worked. At first it would not pair with my galaxy 5. You need to download the Gear app in the Google store or Apple store. It will then pair with the watch and then download software and updates. The watch needs be charged as it comes drained. It will take about 45 minutes to get the software updates from the gear app. During the procedure, it will factory reset the watch which suck because everything was in Chinese. After the update, I was able to set it to English. I was able to get all the features to work, email, contacts, calendar, etc. The various watch faces are very rich looking. The curved look is great but not overly heavy. Just be careful when you buy the watch. The non International version was about $15.00 more.",12,4
Samsung,"After anaylizing the mixed reviews on this Item i determined that most of the promblems people were haveing were user based, and since it looked like it did everything I wanted I decided to go for it. When I first got the watch I was concerned. Nothing seamed to be working right. But... after it went through three of four firmware patches over the course of a few days, things started going like... well... clockwork. The hardware of this watch is AWESOME. The screen, the phone (I make calls from the watch even when my phone is sitting right next to me), texting, navigation, web serfing, even watching the YOUTUBE!. HOWEVER, to get to my very happy state I had to dig through Samsungs special App store which is more more limited in selection than the android store and all the titles were new and unfamiliar. But, after some trial and error, and investing a few dollars, I eventually found the apps to make this hardware sing. Again... its ALL ABOUT THE APPS. Get the right apps and this watch does it all. Don't get the right apps and you will be very frustrated and be writing angry reviews. And it bears repeating... wait for those firmware updates before you make any decisions. The thing was failing in very basic tasks until those updates hit. Overall, if you have a little tech savy, you will LOVE this watch. If it ever brakes or gets eaten by wolves, I'll be clicking the 'buy it again' button in a heartbeat.",24,5
Samsung,"After reading the reviews on here I tried my luck and sure enough, I also received a remanufactured phone. It was not in the original packaging/boxes, not original battery, not original instruction booklet, and the sticker inside the battery compartment clearly says ""Remanufactured."" I'm not sure why Amazon is letting wire4less continue to deceive customers but needless to say, I am returning this item. Thanks for wasting my time, wire4less.",11,1
Samsung,"Beware - If you are buying from Wire4Less (sams distributions llc) - you might end up getting a refurbished phone.That is what I got, and that is what I am returning.Amazon needs to discipline this ""seller"" as quickly as possible because I do not want any more customers being misled.- Thank you.",39,5
Samsung,"i thought i was buying a new phone. this is refurbished. my only complaint is lack of an original box (resale value) and lack of an OEM battery. it did ship with an HTC mytouch leather case, which is arguably an upgrade from the white cardboard nexus box. the phone is free of defects, but is clearly refurbished. i received the 9020t, which is the t-mobile version. its apparently a crapshoot as to which one you receive. seller was wire4less (sams distribution llc)*edit* 10/28/12oh and the phone is amazing by the way. I love the nexus line. I've been travelling in Eastern europe (used a turkish, greek, and georgian SIM with zero effort) and this phone works flawlessly everywhere, popping wifi hotspots is a particularly useful feature. i derive a bit of smug joy watching other tourists become confused when their SIM asks for an international unlock code (Verizon/AT&T phones are generally not international devices out of the box regardless of having ""global"" included in their marketing terminology).as i near the end of my year warranty, my battery life has fallen to less than 2 hours of screen-on use, while this was extended marginally by the 4.1.2 update, its absolutely unacceptable.",12,3
Samsung,"unit arrived in time coz i paid for 2 days shipping,comes with the ff.,no original box instead they use carrying case from HTC mytouch phone,a manual with 11 pages on it,not even mentioned if it is for nexus s.replacement charger although is samsung but you'll know it's not the original.no earphone.replacement battery with no name or brand on it.dies within 7 hrs of standby,probably it will last a couple of hour if you use it.phone has no scratch or whatever,don't know if it's new or not,because there is no plastic protector on it which you can find in any brand new phone.i paid for a new phone because the adds say so,but instead i got this.wire4less shame on you!",28,1
Samsung,"It is quite difficult for the lay-person to figure out this ""will it work on AT&T 3G"" thing. As another reviewer stated, the phone as advertised will not work on AT&T 3G. However, the phone I purchased is actually sold through Wireless Experts. A day after the order was submitted, I received an email from Wireless Experts asking me to call them. I called and was informed asked if my intention was to use this phone with AT&T, to which my reply was, Yes. The person at Wireless Experts told me the difference between the phones--which basically Amazon lists, but if you don't know what to exactly look for, then you won't know the difference (as I didn't). So, Wireless Experts upgraded my order to a Nexus S that is compatible with AT&T's 3G network--and a white one at that!About the phone, as the title of the review states, it is a great phone. The lack of a MicroSD card slot is really not as bad as what I thought it would be. The majority of files I would put on the phone would be music and pictures -- movies are reserved for my tablet. The phone is easily root-able as well as being easy to unlock the bootloader. If rooting your phone is your thing, and you happen to want to adjust processor speed, one thing I found out while using the SetCPU app (my use is for down-clocking the processor when the screen is off to help save battery) -- well, if you set a profile to down-clock the processor for screen off, DO NOT set the processor to its lowest setting in the profile settings. Doing so will cause your phone not to come back on when you attempt to turn the screen back on and you will have to remove and reinsert the battery to get the phone to come back on. I initially thought I had a defective phone and actually had an RMA set to return the phone, when I found out this little item by accident -- but at the right time! If you use the app, set the processor to 400MHz (400000 on the slider).The rest of the phone is standard Google fare. If you've had any Android phone before this, then this one is no different except for the fact that there is no manufacturer apps or user interface on the phone -- just plain Android, and I like that. Hopefully you would too.",20,5
Samsung,"Stay away from this seller. Bought what I thought was a brand new Samsung phone. Received it, started to charge it and screen kept coming on and off even though phone was turned off. After fully charging, battery won't hold a charge. Called Samsung, took my IMEI number only to find out the warranty on this phone expired in 2011, the charger is not a Samsung charger and the battery is not a Samsung battery. Not a happy Amazon buyer. Amazon needs to drop this seller!",11,1
Samsung,"This unlocked T-Mobile phone was exactly as described, except, it said shipping would take 7-10 business days and it arrived in about 3! Super Fast! The item does come with a wall charger and was brand new in the box. Just popped the SIM card in and all was up and running. I think it even came pre-charged. This is a perfect texting phone which I got to replace the phone my daughter broke (which was an earlier model of this same one). Would reccommend this seller and this product.",11,5
Samsung,I love this phone. I just wanted something simple and I wanted something that would close completely so that the other things in my purse would not scratch and mess it up. Also - I have not had any problems with this phone being unlocked. My husband has probably purchased about a dozen different phones from online sellers who say the phone is new and unlocked. This is never the case. None of the phones are truly new and if they are they are not a good qulity version even when they are advertised as being the U.S. version (they are not). This phone was exactly as advertised - it's simple and easy and has no problems whatsoever.,25,5
Samsung,"This phone was purchased for a very close friend of mine that wanted a basic unlocked phone phone. So for her birthday, I purchased this phone and tested it out thoroughly before presenting her with the phone. What did I discover? This somewhat rugged cellphone is a great find for today, the day of the touch phones and I will list some of the other great features.**If you already have an active Sim card from another phone, you can take it out of the old phone and place it in this phone and it will work.** Or you can buy a NEW GSM Sim card as AT&T or T-Mobile and activate the Sim card in this phone online or call the provider and they will activate the Sim card for you. Please see the comment section below as I explain further.Pros:- Easy to set up this phone (but I had to input the APN settings (I have settings for AT&T or T-Mobile or Straight Talk) for MMS and Internet. (Ask me in the comments and I will send you the information on how to do this).- Other Features of this Phone:This phone comes with a wonderful music player, so so camera, Bluetooth, FM Radio, and Internet capabilities (it does not have WiFi).- One of my favorite things is that the battery lasted a full day without the need to charge it and I played music for hours on the music player.- Easy to use and almost carefree flip phone!Would this phone be good for your needs? Well, here is a checklist that so you can determine one way or another if this is a good phone choice. (If you can answer YES to one of these three types of uses, then this may be the phone for you or someone as a gift).1) Anyone who wants a Phone, Phone with no bells and whistles that is easy to set up and use! This is a carefree, no fancy stuff type of phone. If you just want the basics in a phone: Flip phone style, MP3 (music player), camera, FM Radio, this is the phone for you. (This phone does not have WiFi, but it does allow you to get on the internet, if you have APN settings set up).2) People who want the basic type of phone that you can use for PrePaid minutes or GoPhone minutes with ANY GSM provider with no contract such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Simple Mobile, etc. I would advise one of these as they just need to be added to once a year:3) A young child that wants a first cellphone just to text on, make phone calls, listen to FM Radio or listen to MP3 songs! This phone is so so easy to set up and use. This is for someone who just needs to make phone calls sometimes and does NOT need to get on the Internet (data). It does NOT have WiFi in this phone. But it can be set up with APN settings to use data if you have a data plan with AT&T, T-Mobile etc.4) You really need a very basic phone that you can go on a GoPhone or Pre-paid (No contract and no data plan).Both AT&T and T-Mobile offer prepaid minutes of 1,000 minutes good for ONE YEAR for just $100 per year--this is just 10 cents per minute for phone calls with NO CONTRACT! As far as costs for text messages, AT&T charges 20 cents to receive and 25 cents to send (Ouch), these come out of your minutes balance. T-Mobile is cheaper for texts, they just charge 10 cents to receive and I think it is 20 cents to send.When you get the YEARLY PREPAID of just $100 with either AT&T or T-Mobile, this is the CHEAPEST way to go if you do not need lots of minutes and the cost is LESS THAN $10 per month.Thank you for reading this review, if you have any questions, please ask in the comments and I will be happy to answer all questions...",21,5
Samsung,"The Samsung GT-C3520 is an awesome device for any user that just needs a phone. I bought this device specifically for my grandmother who only needs a phone phone. The call quality was clear when using the device (AT&T 3G with four bars out of five service) and simply does just that. Make phone calls. The best part about this is that it is an unlocked device so you may take this to any GSM provider around the world or even in the United States (AT&T, T-Mobile USA, TracFone, Straight Talk, etc...) by inserting the appropriate SIM card. I myself have done this in many foreign countries and have saved a ton of money in roaming charges.Some extras on the device include:-microSD: store photos and music to listen on the go. Great for listening to tunes on the go.-Bluetooth: Connect it to any Bluetooth device such as a headphone for hands-free calling or Bluetooth speakers-FM Radio: If you like listening to radio instead of stored music, this is great too.-It's a phone: This mobile device puts forward the feature that a phone should be built around on. Actually making a phone call.-Old Person Friendly/Kid's First Phone: The interface is easy enough for a senior to navigate and use the device. It also doubles a great starter mobile for kids so they can keep in contact with you while also being able to listen to their music too without lugging around an extra iPod or MP3 player.Overall, it is great for seniors, being the first phone for your kid, or for your vacation to keep in touch without racking up huge phone bills.",21,5
Samsung,"I'm in the South East U.S.A. and I was concerned about purchasing the phone because most of the comments were about phone use in South America and over seas. I am using Simple Mobile unlimited pre-paid which utilizes the T-Mobile network.The Phone works fine! At first the battery life was horrible but once I turned off services like ""location"", ""wi-fi"", ""auto-updates"", the battery lasts for days. Charging it all the way and letting it go completely dead a few times also helps extend battery life.Internet is fast, app switching seems fine, no complaints from me. Other reviews claimed it paled in comparison to the S3 but I'm not seeing much of a difference. It does all I need it to. To be fair, I'm not one of those people who use their phone like a personal computer. I talk, text, and pretty much that's it. I might look up some driving directions occasionally and watch a youtube video here and there. So far doing those things have been a breeze. Haven't tried games or pandora and all that other jazz, just not into it.If you are a person who just needs to talk and text with occasional internet usage, but you don't want to pay $600 for a phone, this is the way to go! The size it awesome it doesn't look like I'm talking into a tablet! LOL",10,4

Samsung,"Okay, so the phone is awesome. I am an avid iphone user but didn't think the 4s or 5 was worth the upgrade. Plus I can purchase this phone unlocked for 300 bucks and use it when I am in the States or Mexico. The one caveat is this one, (the I8190), won't work with 3g data speeds. You will get Edge data speeds but if you want 3G Data in Mexico Telcel, or At&t in the US, you will need the I8190-L. That model has the 850 band that is essential to the Telcel and At&t 3G network data speeds. If I am mistaken on this fact, please correct me, however my research (and experience) spoke to this being true.Bottom line is the phone functions flawlessly and the Android OS is a breeze. Very easy to learn even if you are accustomed to iOS from Apple. Also has a few great features like NFC, toggling wireless and bluetooth and gps connections from the home screen; also a really useful feature of text to call where if you are texting someone and want to call them, you just lift the phone to your ear and after a 1 second delay it automatically dials them. Seemed trivial at first but I found myself using it all the time.The camera is great, although I never used it for video calls because I am married to facetime. Other than that, I highly recommend this model if your local network supports it or the ""-L"" model for use in the States and Mexico. Great user experience!",22,5
Samsung,"100% recommended excellent article, a safe way to make purchases through the internet I recommend to my fellow Venezuelans yes",15,5
Samsung,"Bought it from Wireless Everything. They had good ratings overall which encouraged me. Very vast shipping. Phone came with a U.S. electricity power supply, no international sockets although it came with a separate international adapter outside the phone box. No seal on the box but the phone was brand new with all wrapping. When turned on, the language was defaulted to English U.S., you just click OK. Color looks fantastic, way better than white or blue. Phone made in China, not Korea, or at least this color. I hope it hold for a while. Not sure yet about the quality of the battery. I will update my review in few weeks.",15,4

Samsung,"This phone is a replacement for the android phone that I bought few weeks ago that didn't allow me to surfe the web. Even thought this phone is a little more expensive, but it works right of the box. Unlike the other phone which took 3 weeks to delivered (it was shipped from Singapore), this phone was delivered in 2 days. The resolution could be a little better. But I'm really happy with it so far.",12,4
Samsung,"This is probably the worse phone I have ever had. It is not user friendly at all. I have not downloaded many apps and do not use many apps. I don't use the bluetooth and only use data when I have wifi access. I know this is not the galaxy 111 but based on the high ratings on Samsung phones I really expected better performance. I just switched from a blackberry, but this is really disappointing. Not even the basic features like making a call works well. Its just two months and I really cannot put up with this for much longer. Think I will go Iphone.Pros: Nice size phone- attractive.cons: The buttons on either side of the centre menu buttons do not light up and takes very long to respond when pressed. There is no way to cut off or end a call other than waiting until the touch screen pops up with the end button which takes quite a while after you have dialed - this has resulted in the person on the other end hearing me for at least 15 seconds after I think I have ended the calls. Battery life started out really great for the 1st three weeks or so giving me at least 2 days without charging using wifi and apps. Now - about 2 weeks later its down to less than a day- I have to charge daily. The dual sim does not allow you to pick which sim to call from - it has to be set on 1 at a time and to change you have to go to the settings options and change it. I had dual sim phones before and when you dialed a number there was an option to choose which sim to dial from. For incoming calls it automatically diverts the calls from the sim which is not set, to the sim which is set without the callers knowing that their call is going to another carrier.Difficult to store numbers in the phone book - in fact from time to time I am unable to access some numbers which I know were stored and I did not delete. contacts which were automatically stored as SNS cannot be edited.Sometimes you dial a number, and press call- it just diverts back to the main menu- this happens regularly now.The list goes on.....I definitely will not recommend this phone.",16,1
Samsung,A gift for my husband (birthday) and he's someone who doesn't care for change. He loves it and the large print is what he really needed. Thanks for fast delivery and the phone being as described.,11,5
Samsung,"I bought this phone, used, on Amazon and it serves all my communication needs. I have a digital camera, and I have a good laptop, and I don't need it all rolled into a cell phone. It works reliably, and the Verizon network provides excellent coverage everywhere, even in rural and mountainous areas. If there's a signal, you'll be able to send / receive calls with no problems. I have used this phone for over 2 years, and it has been trouble-free. If you need a so-called SmartPhone, then this phone isn't for you, but if you need only a reliable way to stay in contact almost everywhere, then buy this phone. You can find good deals on lightly-used examples on both Amazon and eBay - just make sure that the phone has a ""clean"" ESN before you buy.",11,5
Samsung,"I just got this phone from Brown Box Bonanza here on Amazon. First, they are great sellers and have amazing customer service. I had several questions and they were right on the emails, answering quickly.The phone is great. It has nice features, like a speakerphone, and it's just the right size. Very user friendly. It comes with a charger, and it charged up fast.When I turned it on, all I had to do was hit the send button and the phone contacted Verizon. This automatically programmed the phone with my number and activated it on my account. Easy, easy, easy phone to use. Good sound quality whether I hold it to my ear or use the speakerphone.The price is right, too. I shopped around and could not find a phone at a reasonable price on Verizon because my upgrade isn't due. I checked Walmart and Radio Shack, but no luck on a nice basic phone at a reasonable price. This is a good deal.It's a very nice, sharp looking phone that fits right into the palm of my hand. I highly recommend it, and Brown Box Bonanza.",33,5
Samsung,"This is a replacement for a cell phone that got damaged. It's a reconditioned phone and works fine. Just what I was looking for -- because Verizon was going to charge me big $'s to get one, which made no sense. This is JUST a plain phone with large display and keyboard -- no camera, emails, texts, apps -- nothing I don't need or use. The price was right! Very pleased.",33,5
Samsung,"I got this for my mom because she is older and likes the big numbers and text. It's not fancy at all so for her case, this is good. She loves it.",16,5
Samsung,"I brought this phone because of the price and functions but have been somewhat displeased with the purchase. Firstly, I got the international version which came in Spanish. I don't speak Spanish so that was quite interesting. Because the phone was international, it was not recognized in the USA. To upload the Samsung Kies update i had to use the Samgung UK website. Secondly, I find it very difficult to select items on the screen without touching the wrong selection. I am a guy but i don't think my fingers are any bigger than average. Thirdly, I find the menus confusing to get through. I am getting there slowly and with time I'm sure I'll get there but for me this phone isn't really user friendly. Forth, If you want to do anything on this phone you need to have a Google Account with a Data Plan.I have never had a Smart Phone before so really wasn't sure what to expect. I keep looking for free Android Apps since I am too cheap to buy them but all the free Apps i can find seem quite poor to me. For me this Smart Phone is just a phone so be sure you know what you're getting into before buying one.",10,3
Samsung,"Long time Linux user, first time Android user's perspective: I picked up one of these and bought my wife a Google Nexus S in January of 2011. The screen is roughly half the size on this one & there is a very noticeable difference while trying to run games or failing to run 480p+ video content, but it works just fine for me. Bought it as a Sansa Clip+ replacement, and I'm extremely happy with it. No comments on voice quality, 3G/EDGE or GSM connection quality - I have yet to test the device with a SIM card, and am using it solely as a personal media player. (I.e. I got tired of waiting for a market enabled iPod Touch competitor)What it can do:* Angry Birds - Some lagginess when a media player is cranking MP3s out in the background, but no major issues. Occasionally hangs up & has to be killed in lengthy sessions.* Voice search - Requires installing the speech-to-text synthesizer, but impressive accuracy & works fine on this limited hardware.* Froyo - The Latin America firmware seems to work. Not accessible through Samsung's provided Keis software, but available from third parties.* Speaker - Respectable music playback & spoken word playback for its price range* Camera - Take decent stills for its price range.* Unplug/Plug-in pause/resume - Addictive feature, but likely common to many Android devices.* Decent battery life - I've been charging it every two days or so, with regular use of the Wi-Fi in the evening and 3-4 hours of daily use as a media player with the screen turned off. Otherwise always kept in standby. (Again, this is SIM-free, no GSM radio usage.)* Wi-Fi - WPA2 Wi-Fi support. Tethering seems to be an option in the Froyo firmware. Didn't check the stock.* MicroSDHC - No issues & good solid seating for my 16gb MicroSDHC card. Located behind the snap-on/snap-off battery cover, but the battery does not have to be removed to get to it. A 1 or 2GB card was included with the phone.* Video - Converting to a lower bitrate seems to be necessary for most of my videos, but no complaints. Small enough screen that there's nothing to be gained from sticking with higher resolutions.What it does poorly:* Wi-Fi disconnections - With both with stock firmware and the official Froyo build, my experience has shown the device to be prone to dropping the Wi-Fi connection when in use by certain apps, or more commonly when leaving.* Volume levels - I frequently find myself wishing there was some sort of equalizer or system-level volume boosting functions I could use to compensate for low volume levels in certain audio tracks. Fine for normal music, but often inadequate with soft-spoken announcers in audio books and podcasts with heavy traffic noise. I will definitely have to buy amplified headphones prior to taking flying with this device.* VPN connections - The Froyo VPN tool looks nice enough, but is extremely finnicky.* FM Radio - Depends on a wired set of headphones for the FM antenna. A common problem, but slightly annoying.* Apps-to-SD - This Froyo feature seems to be somewhat overrated. Frequent problems with apps that say they support the move, but then disappear from the application menu afterwards. Still, even after giving up, with some 30 apps installed, I have 30.8Mb of the 170Mb of internal flash available. Apparently this just isn't that big a deal.What it won't do:* Multitouch - Unfortunate, but made up for in large part by the numerous buttons & the D-pad.* Flash (bulb) - It doesn't have one, not that many do in this price range.* Flash (Adobe) - The processor seems to be incompatible with the current builds of Adobe Flash. Haven't personally tested it, but it's not all that likely to work. There may be other workarounds.Notes for battery hoardin' folks:* Uses MicroUSB chargers - Tested with BlackBerry charger & a solar charger without problems.* 3.7v, 4.44wh, 1200mAh li-ion battery. M/N: AB474350BUA few quick 5500-tested App recommendations: MortPlayer Audiobooks/Music, BeyondPod, Pulse, Aldiko, Comixology, Droid Comic Viewer, Angry Birds, and File Expert (That last gives integrated FTP & HTTP file management - I basically never use a USB connection for data transfers.)Market glitches from use overseas, in Chile (not yet in the paid-app country white-list):* I don't know whether this is because of the firmware or my physical location, but it was impossible to obtain numerous free apps and ANY paid apps out of the box or after updating to Froyo. Using the new web-based app market, I can see paid apps, but none will allow me to install and many apps that ARE available through the normal market refuse to install due to ""carrier restrictions"" on this unlocked, SIM-free phone.* Free apps I was unable to install included: Amazon's Kindle & MP3 stores, Google Books, the voice-to-text synthesizer, and Google Listen. Free apps loaded on the phone that I was unable to update included Gmail, YouTube, and Google Search.* The issues above can be wholly resolved using Market Enabler, but that requires rooting the phone. I would be very interested to hear if a VPN to the US or simply being present in the US or another country with paid-app access has these same issues.[Aug 2011] A couple quick updates, six months in:* Wifi disconnections - This proved to be largely an issue of signal strength. This device has a perfectly usable wireless range, but it's still not quite as good as some other devices in my appartment. A second router and setting the wifi sleep mode to ""never"" or ""never when plugged in"" was enough to resolve this issue.[...]* GSM use - Took the device home to the US on vacation and picked up a prepaid TMo SIM. Worked just fine, but only EDGE (at least using the i5500L Froyo ROM). That was enough to eliminate the need for the Market Enabler. Allows purchase of paid apps even after my return to Chile.* Battery life update - Massive change in battery life when I was stateside. With heavy use of the browser & Google Maps and occasional use as a phone, I found myself needing to change batteries at mid day every day while on vacation. Fine for tooling about town, although it still drained much quicker than w/o a SIM, but constant Maps use while playing the tourist in NYC absolutely killed the battery life.",79,4
Samsung,"This is a great little phone, with many android capabilities. I've decided on it, to give a try to the android phone interface, compared to my long experience with windows mobile smart phones. It is generally a nice cellphone, with v. good price for a smart phone. Just be prepared to do some deciphering to change the default menu from an Eastern European language to English. Once done, most of things go fairly well after that.I'd list here my overall impressions after using it for about a week:1- Well built & light handset, with small screen, decent resolution (don't expect AMOLED sharp, but it is good)2- Responsive capacitive, single point touch screen (so no pinching or any other two-touch gestures).3- This is essentially the i5500 Europa, which has the android 2.1, and android market access.4- The camera is OK, but poor focus with mediocre images, so take it as it is, a phone camera.5- Registering into the android market was a little slow, but I did it through registering my gmail account via wifi only, then things started to work well after that ( I use them mainly with wifi, without issues)6- I'm trying to get the navigator to work with offline maps, but it seems tricky, I'll give update if I get it to work.7- Using the supplied Keis software on win 7, I was able to sync with my outlook directly for calendar & contacts, in addition to Google sync too.8- Finally, downloading the android app killer app is a must, so you can keep your phone running smoothly.All in all, a great smart phone, with good and peppy operating system that you can try with pleasure, without being forced to commit to the obscene mandatory data charges & 2Y contract extension with your service carrier.",27,5
Samsung,"Unlocked phone have the advantage of letting you choose your carrier by just replacing the sim card.They also are great for travelers since the rest of the world uses GSM. It's wasy to get cheap sim cards all over the world, saving you roaming charges.MobileCityOnline supplied my order via Amazon. Although I requested second day air, 6 days elapsed between placing the amazon order and arrival.They appeared new on arrival despite broken seals on the boxes. They came configured for Slovenia. So, you have to go into the settings (in slovenian) and set the language to english US. Kind of tricky but doable. Takes about two minutes.From there after charging first time I installed $5 ATT sim cards and the phones were able to place and receive calls. The nice thing is ATT lets you choose how to pay when you set up the sim card accounts. You can either post pay or prepay. Since we're not big talkers I chose prepay. This setup actually works better than my Tracphone and my old Virgin Mobile phone. Every call pops up a window at the end showing what the cost was and how much is left. Nice. ATT's website also logs every call and transaction. Cool.WiFi setup was straightforward. Connect to the access points it sees, maybe enter a password, and you're online. Once online you can click on the App Market icon and download whatever apps you like. The only bug I ran into is if you connect to access points that require a username/password to log in, and they use self signed certificates. You may have to use the Opera browser so the redirect works correctly and you can get connected.Once you are on WiFi you can configure your google account and it will sync your google contacts and calendar and you have gmail in a shrunken down mobile version.To get mobile data when I was away from a WiFi access points I had to buy an add-on data package, which can be priced at MB per 30 day period, or they have a unlimited call/data plan for a fixed price per day. I like having options.To get mobile data to work I had to hand enter an access point name (APN) for AT&T. The the edge icon came on and I was in business.Just google APN and android and ATT.The phones are not running the latest Android version, not that that's a show stopper. And if you're a version snob you can upgrade the firmware yourself. KIES software comes that lets you easily bring in media from your PC like pictures and music. The phone itself is kind of small and compact compared to the bigger Galaxy S or motorola or HTC smartphones. My wife likes the size, I could do with a bigger screen but the nice thing is this one will slip in a shirt or pants pocket easily. You can tilt the screen sideways to make typing on the virtual keyboard easier.If I only used WiFi instead of mobile data I could probably go like 2 months on a $25 airtime refill. Even with a data plan I'm convinced this is cheaper than those long commitment plans.The phone also has a GPS and an FM radio but I really haven't used them much. An app is on the phone that shows your location on google maps, but it's not a replacement for a Garmin GPS in your car since you need live data via a data plan. It's handy though, but since the GPS eats power I usually leave it off.These being european versions of the Corby, the charger included is the two prong euro type, with a snap on american outlet adapter. So much the better if you plan to visit europe. They also charge and sync from a mini usb cable, the phone's power connector seems smaller then the standard micro usb connector.It has an ""airplane mode"" that saves power and turns GPS, WiFi and Mobile data off.Overall, for like $150 you can have a decent little Quad band GSM Samsung android smartphone and choose whatever kind of service you like. And you can change carriers any time you like. That's only a little more $$ than a flip phone.Overall slightly more tinkering required than a phone store but you can definitely save money -and- still have a smartphone.People think they're getting a good deal when they get low or no cost subsidized phones but trust me... you will pay for the phone. There's no free lunch!Not a perfect smartphone but a solid performer.Recommended. :)",27,4
Samsung,"I received the phones from the seller "" Open Group Wireless"" a few days ago and found out the seller intend to deceive the consumers by saying this phone is ""I8160bk"". There are three versions of this Galaxy Ace 2 cellphone: I8160, I8160P, I8160L.The actual product this seller sent out is the ""I8160L"" version, which is the ""Thailand"" version. This version can't be upgraded to Android system 4.1.2.I definitely don't recommend this seller ""Open Group Wireless"".",17,2
Samsung,"Before purchasing this phone, I had the Galaxy Grand Duos with a 5 inch screen that I found to be much too bulky and heavy for me. Then I discovered this phone with a large 4.7 inch screen, and I find it sleek and light to hold and to carry around. Since I am a true techie, I researched this phone for all specs as soon as it was released on several websites. My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.PROS:+ SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size considering the fact that it has the 4.7 inch screen, which I find ideal - not too small and not too large. It fits easily into my smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Because the phone is so light, I carry it easily on my jeans with the pouch/case that I purchased for the phone. The large 4.7 inch screen size is very large in my opinion, large enough for pleasantly viewing webpages, emails, videos and more! I can easily read my emails CLEARLY with this phone.+ TWO MICRO SIZED SIM CARD SLOTS: Glad I bought a Sim cutter on Amazon. So I just cut my old standard Sim cards and popped them into this phone and they work just fine. They read my carrier plan and I did not have to set up the APN settings for Internet and MMS as the setup did this for me automatically). This is good to know if you want to use your regular Sim card and not have to deal with settings yourself. What a great feature.+ Screen Resolution - For me personally, I find the resolution and clarity of this screen excellent - the colors are vivid and I find it to be a very sharp and clear screen. Websites are clear and easy to read, PDF docs and emails are clear and easy to read on this large 4.7 inch screen. To make the home screen show off the icons beautifully, I went to Playstore and installed the free Backgrounds HD Wallpaper and selected a dark blue sky picture and now home screen is STUNNING and the white letters on the icons really stand out.+ Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.+ WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and if I far from my home router, the WiFi signal has a strong signal. In fact the WiFi is very strong in every location that I tested it. When not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T for data and easily get 3G and I have gotten 3G+ (there is no 4G in my area). The data is very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is.+ Camera - The camera has a 5MP, which concerned me. So I completed my through testing indoors and outdoors with this camera. Findings: Without the flash on and in good lighting, the pictures come out very clear and the colors are true, hues are perfect. When using FLASH, be sure to change the White Balance to Incandescent (if you do not, the pictures will have a dark reddish hue). Quality of the pictures: I downloaded the pictures that I took to my computer and the quality is excellent, very sharp and beautiful pictures!+ Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the BEST battery life of ANY smartphone or that I ever owned. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning).+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - The manual states you can add up to a 64GB SD card. This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone! Personally, I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE:This phone is advertised at 8GB of Internal space. The 8GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 4 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: I downloaded a FREE APP called Kingsoft Office which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is... So ask me in the comments if you need instructions and I will send them to you.- The instruction with the book may come to you in a non English book. Mine came in Polish and there was no book in English. I have downloaded the free full sized manual from Samsung on this phone. If you need this, contact me in the comment section and request this manual in PDF file. Or I can also provide you with the website so you can download the manual yourself.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal as I use Dropbox to download my photos and files and it is fast and easy.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would because for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from this phone like the S3 or S4 models and also you want just the most important features, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.",56,5
Samsung,"I got the phone and it is what I expected. No problem with anything of consequence. Did not get 8 GB Sandisk SD card free offered on page. Users guide in Chinese, no problem.

Samsung,"I ordered this phone a couple weeks ago. No where on the ad did it state that this is a prepaid phone only. I received it on time and would have been happy with it, but had to return it and other items I ordered with it at same time. My problem is they did not state prepaid and it cost me about $8 for restocking and s&h. This would not have happened if he had advertised correctly.",10,1
Samsung,"Very simple. I've been told it looks like a mini version of the Samsung Galaxy. I used to have a Motorola Droid, this is way better, I just wish it had a front camera. Very top notch. Like new! Love it!",11,5
Samsung,"not a galaxy 3, but nice software, everything works. Battery kinda iffy but I bought it used and expected that. Running it downall the way occasionally and charging up turned off, and using juice defender helps. I can get two days if I don't use it alot. Already dropped it and it didn't hurt it at all, so so far so good. Didn't pay that much so pleased in that regard, and it workson Page Plus (which rokz btw) so I'm happy.",31,4
Samsung,"Don't be fooled by the answered questions section of this sales listing. You are receiving a Samsung U485P prepaid model phone for Verizon.

I just can't use it.",11,2
Samsung,"These phones are workhorses...they have been dropped, washed, dried, left on the lawn overnight...pop them in a bag of rice and they are good to go!

If you need a ""dumb phone"" with a querty keyboard that holds a charge forever-look no further!",10,5
Samsung,"I purchased this product cuz the description said that the ESN was clear. Yes, I successfully activated it, however, it's so meaningless if the cellphone cannot make/receive a call. I brought the cellphone to the verizon wireless and they confirmed that the cellphone itself was broken. I immediately returned it but I had to pay some extra cost for the shipping to send it back. They covered only the part of the shipping fee, not the whole cost.",32,1
Samsung,The phone works like new all I had to do was clean it up a little and take it to get activated.,13,4
Samsung,"Mother-in-law loves the simplicity of this phone. Buttons are big - and answering is simple by just opening phone. Had a little difficulty with Verizon employee not knowing how to sync older phones to network, so if you have trouble - find a tech who knows what they are doing.",22,5

Samsung,"She says it's perfect. She can hear, its easy, and its EASY. She downgraded from a Droid Razr, and now she is in love with this phone",18,5
Samsung,I recently ordered a Samsung Flip Phone through Amazon.com. The seller was extremely efficient in sending us the product. It was shipped the next day and arrived within 5 days which we appreciated since we were leaving on a trip and needed the phone ASAP. The phone was practically new and had no defects. Verizon had no trouble flashing it. I appreciate the promptness with which the seller handled this transaction,16,5
Samsung,"I am an Electrical Engineer and have had a number of smart phones (including Galaxy note 2 and 3 , galaxy s4,iphone 4,4S,5 and s5).This phone has two micro Sim slot and one sd card slot.The screen is sharp and has great viewing angle. The Android operating system is quick and had no lag at all.The phone comes will jellybean. The software is such that you can set to receive calls even if you are already on one sim (Set call forwarding....my be charged for that service depending on provider)....Inter speed is H+ not 3G: H+ is faster than 3G.......the Only bad thing about this Phone is that it only comes with 8 Gigs of internal storage.",22,5
Samsung,"Purchased this phone for my husband and he LOVES it. It has great features and works well with his service (Straight Talk). The only downside so far, is that nobody seems to sell protective cases for it. We can't find them in any stores, or anywhere online. The only thing we can find is a pouch-style holder, which is not practical for him. Otherwise, it is wonderful. I love that it has a built-in hot-spot. I can use his wifi on my phone or tablet in places where there isn't free (or any) wifi at all.",19,4
Samsung,"I have the phone for less than 2 months and it had died on me for more than 4 times! There is no reason or pattern when or where or how it will happen. Temporary fix is to take out the battery, put it back in, wait and turn it on. You never know if it is going to get back up again. No warranty from this seller. There is a 14 days return policy but phone did not die within this time frame. Do not buy.",11,1
Samsung,"I'm someone who knows what is buying, so I knew about this phone and the differences between this one and the Note 3, and is exactly why I got it. However, this seller sent it ground, THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE! It's a SMARTPHONE! This things can be smelled and stolen very easily. I don't think it is a proper way to send a 500 dls item. It's just disrespectful for the customer who just spent 500 dls on your phone!There are many other sellers who will respect you as a customer and send it air, they'll be even some who will be eligible for amazon prime. This purchase experience was aweful!",19,1
Samsung,I mean I'm completely satisfied.Sorry I do not speak very good English.The phone came to me in the scheduled date.You are the max ..!Right now I'm using my phone.,10,5
Samsung,"good day, I do buy 2 mobile galxy S4 Mini factory unlocked but when I receive the phones are requesting an unlock code and the box has a label that says they are for use in europe your ad on amazon says that are unlocked are paying almost $ 800 for them so I ask my cellphone unlocked I hope you can resolve the situation extremely grateful and really disappointed by the poor service",81,1
Samsung,"the phone takes 6:30 hours getting charged and just the phone was samsung. Box was black with android logo, the batery is not samsung neither the chargers",11,1
Samsung,"Good one... Just what i was expecting.. And good at services.. Totally Recommended... And works with Digitel, movistar y movilnet at venezuela",30,5
Samsung,"Let me just say I am loving this phone, I have only had it for 2 weeks and I am learning something new everyday. I really liked my Galaxy s3 mini too, but Straight Talk now has 4g LTE in my area and I wanted a phone that also had 4g. This is a great little phone, it is a little bit taller and a little narrower than the s3 mini, but when I put it in the case I can't really tell. It does seem a little faster than my s3 mini. I have gotten two days out of the battery, but I am not a heavy phone user. I play a few games like bejeweled, a little bit of texting, checking email, as an alarm clock and making phone calls. I very rarely use it to surf the web or watch videos. I am probably not the most techy person, but I have to say for my purposes this is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone who does not want a huge phone, but still likes to have the quality of one. It did come unlocked and sealed, although like someone else it looked to have been opened and then resealed with an official seal. My guess is that SHOPBEST opened it to put in the plug adapter in it, so I could use it in the US without an issue. This is an inter national phone so the plug comes as a 220v and you need to put a converter on it for 110v. This is the mini version not the regular version. I knew all that coming in so be prepared if you don't read the product description to be surprised.",28,5
Samsung,"the product was in perfect conditions. it came in a box, its new and works good. it has all the things described and comes with the useful things you need in a phone. (headphones, charger, etc)",21,4
Samsung,"The device arrived the same day than other products despite the extra $$$ for the two day shipping. It was late if we consider that was expected after two labor days. It was a waste to have two shipping days...The device itself is great. I had the old vibrant S4G from t-mobile but just broke its screen. This G4Smini is just a little bit bigger but best replacement. I do not like the super sized S4. The model is the GT-I9195 from somewhere in europe (france?). It comes with a brochure from the mobile company Orange. After charged, I turned it on and asked me the preferred language, data for account logins and internet. Created some accounts as well and finally was up and running fine. The charger has a plug useful in some countries in europe and many other countries in latam etc. The seller included an adapter for the US connector. The box itself appeared unopened with its seal intact, but a more careful look showed that the seal was on top of a previously broken seal. Both seems to be official but who knows how hard can be to make a sticker with the words ""samsung"" on it... The device had plenty of plastics protecting all the sides and corners so it looks ""enough"" new to me.The cons:- horrible boot screen. No idea how to replace it without rooting the phone.- many not needed applications you cannot uninstall unless rooting the device (as most smartphones).- it uses microSIM cards... No idea why since it has plenty of space for the regular SIM cards. I had to buy a cutter to trim my old SIM.- the device comes with android 4.2.2. I was expecting something more recent. At least 4.3, or an update. But no....- its price feels way too high for a device with only 8GB of internal memory (already shared with OS and the several updates to its original apps).I recommend the product but knowing in advance its details.EDIT: Be aware that as with previous model, Samsung messed it up. Firmware 4.2.2 ""allows"" to move apps to SD to free internal memory space. But it is not true... all it does is to say it did it, but it only moves the apps to a sort of partition or folder ""./emulate/0"" on the same INTERNAL MEMORY!!!! Checked many forum and this issue is reported since S III, but is still not solved by Samsung.Some stated that firmware 4.3 may solve it but my Kies still says 4.2.2 is the latest firmware.This is a HUGE fault on this device. My previous S4G Vibrant, really moved the apps to the SD as most android devices. It is one of the plus over iPhones. But this one, more modern and very expensive device just fakes it. Do not get confused by Samsung Support FAQ stating this is only due to developpers of some apps not using SD compatibility, because no one app was in fact moved to the SD card. All went to the emulated area inside the internal memory despite stating the app was moved to SD. I even checked my SD card on linux to see all hidden forldes and NADA. No one app was moved there, not even a folder was created to do so. Google this issue and you will find many forums showing this problem.I do not like when manufacturers LIE and sellers do nothing to inform their customers about what the product really is. This bug is known since long time and the seller should know the products they sell. When I press move to SD, and it says it did it, I expect to find it on the SD card. Too much to ask?My internal memory is getting full by just having built-in apps auto-updated.I am overseas now. Otherwise I would ask for a full refund.No, I do not recommend this product until Samsung offers a firmware update that solves this issue.",18,1
Samsung,"I really like this phone. Its a big step up from my previous phone (google nexus-s), so of course it will be a huge improvement. Looks great, its fast, the screen feels and looks awesome, and its a very capable phone. I love ""dragging and dropping"" music and movies on to this phone with ease, unlike some other ""fruity"" phones. I purchased a Samsung EVO 32gb micro SD card along with this for about $20, and they work great together. The phone is a little light and definitely needs to be put in a good case immediately to protect the screen and beauty.I rated this OVERALL experience 4 stars - not because of the phone, but because of the ad in general. I know I could have done some better research, which I usually do, but I think it needs to be made clear that in the USA this phone is not compatible with most 4g/LTE networks. I am using Tmobile and the voice/text work excellent, but for my data connection I fluctuate from EDGE (2g) most the time, to HSPA+ in ""TOWN"". I live on the big island of Hawaii, so that probably has a lot to do with it, because I know in some major cities such as Honolulu, LA, Seattle, etc...people using this phone are getting HSPA+ consistently. I called ATT to check the compatibility of this phone and apparently you can get 4g with it.All in all, this is a killer phone - comes brand new and sealed in the box with all paperwork and accessories. It is European so it comes with the european wall type outlet plugs, with an adapter for US plugs. And the shipping was very fast at around 3 business days (I paid extra shipping costs). I just wanted to let people know to do their research and check the compatibility with their cell phone carrier. I personally am not some kind of ""power user"" - so being in 2g sometimes doesnt bother me. But I know there are people out there who have to be in 4g conditions 100% of the time, and if you are one of those people - I would reconsider buying this international model and get one straight from your carrier or samsung.",17,4
Samsung,"For the sake of total disclosure, the Note 5 is a five-star phone in every way. This review is for those clinical level investigators that begin their research with one-star reviews, to expose any weaknesses of a product. That said, I have transitioned from a Galaxy S3 to the Note 5. The Note 5 is more intuitive, faster, and offered the least painful transition from an existing phone, with the ƒ??Samsung Switchƒ? app. I would sincerely encourage the reader to get a protective case for the phone. The Note 5 is NOT indestructible. Its been over a month since I activated (and case protected) my Note 5, and I could not be more satisfied with this Samsung product. A word of caution though, this phone will NOT work on the Sprint cellular network. I found this out the hard way. Just because itƒ??s ƒ??unlockedƒ? does not make it adaptable to any network. T-Mobile helped this ƒ??doubting Thomasƒ? to understand that, and redeem an otherwise costly mistake.P.S. The Vendor: Open Group Wireless is awesome! I received a new-in-the-box phone, in record time. No complaints.",10,1
Samsung,"Okay, so the Samsung Galaxy Note II is obviously a great phone, and as I feel that reviews of this nature should focus more on the seller, I won't discuss how amazing this phone is, in and of itself. This phone is roughly $800 from AT&T, Verizon, and Amazon out-of-contract. The seller listing the product here is selling it for $300 less than anyone else and it's not used or refurbished. That is pretty spectacular. However, the battery that came with this phone is next to useless. It has no brand name marked on it and just says Made In China. The life of the battery is terrible. I literally have to leave my phone plugged into the wall at all times. If I unplug it, the battery drains waaaay too quickly. My friend has this phone and his battery is not even close to as bad as mine. He bought his phone from Verizon and it came with a battery that, while it looks similar in marking and color to mine, it says Samsung across it. Mine does not. His charger is also completely different. It's very likely that my charger is a fake too, although the piece that plugs into the outlet says Samsung on it, it is not the stock charger that comes with the phone. The phone, battery, and charger came in a plain AT&T box that was not sealed, although it was shrinkwrapped. Part of the box had been torn and patched with scotch tape. It came with the appropriate manual. Fortunately, despite all of this, the phone itself is 100% legitimate and works perfectly. I will be forced to purchase a real battery for $20 or so and I will probably invest in a new charger at a later time, but this doesn't really bother me a lot. It irks me, slightly, that the seller felt the need to sell the phone with a s***ty battery, but honestly, a battery and the actual Samsung Note II box is NOT worth $300 extra dollars to me. If you need to buy this phone out of contract, then I would recommend purchasing it from this seller even though their choice of sending it with a fake battery is questionable, you'll still come out ahead purchasing this phone here and a new battery from somewhere else. I'm still relatively happy with my purchase. Perhaps the seller should notify that this device ships with a third-party battery instead of the OEM Samsung battery, but it's not a HUGE deal. If you want this phone new, get it here unless you want to pay $300 for a nice box and a battery. If you're okay with a used phone, then I recommend you go to Swappa and look there. I don't like buying used electronics like this, however.",50,4
Samsung,"Phone arrived as scheduled apparently undamaged. The box was a plain box labeled ""AT&T"" but not a new retail AT&T box. There was no, absolutely no, paperwork in the box just the phone, the battery, the wall charger, a usb cable and a set of Samsung earbuds. The phone is a wonderful piece of electronics and the Android OS is easy to learn and use. I had to get a new sim, my old one was a full size and the Note 2 uses a mini. The phone was instantly recognized by the AT&T system and picked up both a cell and data signal. The problem that I am having is with the usb connection. It is apparently defective. I can charge the battery, but only consistently if the phone is off. I have only been able to connect with my computer once, and that was a struggle. I have contacted Samsung and they have assured me that the phone is under warranty should I need to get it repaired but that requires sending the phone in and having to pay to ship it there and being without it for who knows how long. As this is a ""new"" phone and an expensive phone one would expect that it would not need to be repaired upon arrival. I have not contacted the seller yet as I am still trying to see if the problem is software or hardware related.Pros:Beautiful screenFast processorResponsive OSActually good battery life (when I can get it charged)Cons:AT&T crapware that is unremovable (this on top of the OS and Samsung's software left a little over 10 gig out of the base 16 gig usable)the usb connection problem that I am havingI would still recommend this phone to anyone that needs the screen size and does not mind the fact that it is a big phone.UPDATE 5/3/13:The problem with the USB port was resolved by resetting the phone to factory default (had to download the manual from Samsung for directions). The problem did let me find out 2 things: 1 - the seller was quick to offer an exchange if necessary, good communication response and helpful and 2 - the phone is covered by a Samsung 1 year warranty, you do have to register the phone for warranty support.",31,5
Samsung,The seller said that the cellphone is in very good condition.but Item was come repackaged. There are serious scratches on the screen. and it has Serious damage to whole phone.This is Cheating,10,1
Samsung,"I was a little worried about purchasing such a large phone but in the end after always wishing I had a bigger screen decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did. I even have small (female) hands and I have not found, so far, any issues with having a large phone. I love the camera, the screen, the larger keyboard and even have discovered that I use the S-pen (which I never thought I'd even remove from its cubby). I never have any issues reading texts or emails (the type is large enough to not have to expand the view). And the features (I find a couple of new ones every day) are amazing! There are some gimmicky features, sure! But I am surprised how many features of this phone I have now integrated into my daily routine. I no longer carry a sketchbook (interior design student) or a note pad (list maker). I just pull out the s-pen and all of my sketches and lists are created and stored in the same spot. I also love the fact that I can just jot down a friend's contact info and then save it into my phone! The camera isn't the best on the market these days but I can't complain at all! I knew when I was doing my research that other phones had better cameras but so far the Note 2 has far surpassed my expectations! The battery is surprisingly powerful too given how often I use this phone throughout the day. Because of it's generous size and ease of use I am constantly looking up anything and everything online whereas with my previous phone I sometimes put it off until I could use my laptop. I also have put away my Kindle and have now added the Kindle app to my phone. Again, since the screen is larger I have no problem reading books right on my phone. Once again, I love this phone! It does everything but wash my dishes.",35,5
Samsung,"First I want to say I love this phone. Everything about it is amazing. If I was you I would buy somewhere else. When I first opened the box the phone looked like it was in great shape, its when I first turned it on that I noticed that there was something wrong.... the screen had burnt in images and not just a little bit I mean bad.. I fear that I got a display model... the screen had lifting issues were the screen is separating from the phone itself. Finally the s pen was busted. The sensitivity wouldnt adjust and the tip was worn to nothing. The sad part is this phone was supposed to be refurbished. its a good thing im tech savvy or else I would have returned it. I installed the new screen for cheap and got a new s pen for cheap. I love this phone and recommend it to anyone interested in it. I would just buy from someone else",12,3
Samsung,"Phone is beautiful and big. Totally unlocked, I activated it with straight talk and it works awesome. No hassle at all. Love it! Highly recommend to anyone.",13,5
Samsung,This is a really good phone. Battery holds better than the note. I got it at a good price because the G Note 3 came out with a hand full of extras but I'm sticking to this phone for a while on my $ 45.dollar Straight Talk Plan which works great on thid plan.,20,4
Samsung,everthing is good as expected .after a month of usage i really found it worth buying it.4G speed is good.battery comes around 48 hours at nominal use.,18,4
Samsung,This Cell is perfect for everyday use! Has a BIG Screen on it & Works really Well! I would recomend this cell 2 anyone looking for something with a FULL KEYBOARD and decent Style at a low price!!,10,5
Samsung,"First off you should know that this phone only charges .25 minutes per text received and send which is 50% of the regular Net10 phones and the main reason of my purchase, that being said...Important info you should know about this phone.Features: 1.3Mega Pixel camera, Long battery life, Quarty KeyboardMy impressions: Keys are small but easy to type on, this phone does not support T9 word and calling numbers is slightly more annoying since the keys are smaller then most are used to. I can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the Wyoming area where I am located and it says data restriction 36 but from videos the browser is nothing special.It is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter. Picture quality is better then my old 1.3MP camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing, I'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like, and this phone is no exception, but still it is nice to have the feature.Also you can lock the keypad by pressing and holding the spacebar down.Features aren't great but you can get around 300 minutes or about 1200 text for 20$ per month on this phone which is very cheap for those of us who don't talk much.",71,4
Samsung,"After looking at smart phones, and noting that the user manuals were typically 500 pp. (not, alas, an exaggeration), I realized that a phone of middling intelligence would suit me just fine. The price here was 50% - 60% less than on other sites. It arrived promptly, and does all that I ask it to do: call, text, and function as my alarm clock. It does have Internet connectivity, but it's so slow, it's like time-travel back to the 1990s. I knew that going in, however. If you need to be able to update your twitter and/or Facebook frequently from your phone, keep on looking. If you just want a, you know, a *phone*, this is smart enough.",69,4
Samsung,"I have been through two other phones with Net10 and this phone kept me with the service. The quality of the phone and the ""Verizon"" CDMA towers it uses in my area make it seem like I'm using contract phone service with Net10 prepay. Phone call quality is very clear and I have service in areas I didn't have with my previous Verizon Wireless contract phone.",48,5
Samsung,"After recently becoming one of America's newest smartphone customers, I was going to pass my pristine?ÿSamsung A797 Flight Red At&t Qwerty Keyboard Touch Screen 3g Gps Cell Phone?ÿto my youngest daughter until I saw this phone listed on Amazon.com.First off, the deal is crazy. Less than 25 dollars for this phone!Secondly, I like Net10, because you can switch their calling plans hassle-free! I can easily tailor my daughter's plan to her actual cell phone usage!Add a cute ""blinged-out"" phone case?ÿSamsung R355c Blue Circle Silver Jewel Bling Dazzle Diamonds Protector Straight Talk Net 10 HardCase Cover Skin NET 10 Straight Talk?ÿand a phone charm, and she is in business!Did I mention the insane price, and that the phone arrived BRAND NEW, unopened, still in the box?It doesn't support Opera, but I was able to bookmark Google Mobile, which automatically gives her Google Maps (of course, she isn't going to need that yet, but it's nice to have, LOL).The phone also has a surprisingly decent mp3 player (you can upload music to it using a data cable), camera (no video, but your pics can be customized!), expandable memory and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack! You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3's for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won't allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear. So far, we've had no problems with reception (everything works where we live, so we're probably not going to have too many issues with dropped calls).Best of all, my daughter LOVES her new phone.Thank you SO MUCH for providing this item for Amazon customers at such a great price!**UPDATE**Just a little tip....it costs 3.5 minutes to send an MMS, so if possible, link your device via Bluetooth and send MMS that way.",26,5
Samsung,received phone early..fast delivery...nice phone..even though its an older model stores still carry this model..kmart sells it for $99 .. i will be buying another for myself..this one was for my son..thanks amazon,13,5
Samsung,"I've had this phone for about a month now and it's become very helpful.I only use it for job/quick calls, I'm not much of a talker so I needed a prepaid phone.I bought a 200min card from NET10 the same day I got it and after a month, i still have 100+ min left. Buying this phone was definitely the right choice because it was cheap and I don't need a plan.It's a very light and has common cellphone features. The thing that I dislike, is that if you don't lock it, the browser button might get dialed by accident and then your minutes will just go. Happened to me twice but I quickly realized...i lost like 10min.It has a nice design and the camera is ok. This cellphone is nothing fancy but it does the job.The keypad buttons are kinda small but my hands are small so it's ok.Since I usually have the screen turned off, the battery lasts a lot of time. I never let it past 2 bars(out of 5) so I don't know how long it truly lasts. (I only remember charging it twice, when 3 bars left, ever since i got it a month ago)",21,5
Samsung,"I was trying to find a phone that did not require a data package. According to Verizon, this phone does require one. I had to cancel my order, but it was not the seller's fault.***UPDATE: This evening I have talked to three Verizon CSRs and received three different answers on the data plan issue. I am going to confirm tomorrow and update this review again with a definitive answer (that is in writing).*** LATEST UPDATE: I just had a conversation with Verizon concerning this phone. According to the CSR I spoke with, and confirmed by his supervisor, when you activate this phone, they will automatically add a $9.99 data plan that covers 75MB of data. However, you can request that the data plan be removed and that a data block be placed on the phone.The latest information satisfies my concerns and I have requested that the seller rescind my cancellation request and ship the phone. I will be back later after I activate the phone to let you know how my wife likes it. Stay tuned.",81,5
Samsung,"I like this phone because it is similar to my Samsung Reality SCH-U370... (Which died a sudden death unexpectedly.) I did not want a data package and after numerous research, I almost ruled it out because everything said you had to have a data plan with this phone. But, one reviewer, helped me so much!!! He didn't want one either. Dealing with Verizon (which can be no pleasant thing...) can be challenging. But you can ask to have the data package dropped and a data block placed on the phone.Great phone...Highly Recommended!",11,5
Samsung,"The phone was great for the first 6 months. Then it started doing crazy things. Taking pictures for no reason, volume changing for no reason..... So contacted the seller - JUST CELLULAR... They said, sorry, we only help you out for 30 days, then you are out of luck. I tried to work with them, and this is the email responce that said, Sorry to bad, can't help you. I will NEVER purchase another phone from them and will NOT recommend JUST Cellular to anyone!",12,1
Samsung,"The phone came as described, brand new and still in the box. I was also very surprised at how fast it arrived. I think it was about 3-4 day. Verizon had no problem activating it onto my plan and there were no hidden fees at Verizon so that was nice.The battery that came with the phone was not a good one and they had no control over that. So I had to buy a new battery and when I told them that, they were more than willing to help cover that cost. The person who emailed me was very sorry about it and he was also very nice.I would recommend them to anyone and I will make future purchases with them.",12,5
Samsung,The phone was everything that my wife wanted andthat is what makes it perfect. It is one of a veryfew phones that will work on the new Ford Sync systemWITHOUT having to pay the phone carrier for a data pack.,19,5
Samsung,"Well...when i bought this phone, It kept shutting off when you close the keyboard. Didn't pay no mind to it at first. Then it got to where it would not come on at all. Didn't even have it a month. Who ever had this phone didn't take care of it. Not very honest in your ad. won't buy from you again. Amazon marketplace keeps this up, I won't buy from any of it other than amazon itself. People need to get their ads state with what they are selling and be honest. Why rune a good site like amazon with the junk that people want to sell and pass off as a good item on the marketplace.",10,1
Samsung,"I was looking for a durable, t-mobile compatible, flip phone for my hard working hubby and this is PERFECT! It's made by AT&T, but since it's an unlocked phone and it takes the same sim card as t-mobile...I just stuck his card in and it worked perfectly. It's large enough for his big hands and has big buttons. The sound, reception, and features are GREAT! It doesn't have a lot of ""bells and whistles"", but that isn't what we were looking for. This one seems to be built to last and that is perfect for us! SO pleased!",10,5
Samsung,This phone has better reception than any cell phone I've had. Very rugged. Has survived many drops onto concrete floors with no problems. Moved simm chip from my old phone to this one and that's all there was to it.,50,5
Samsung,"I recently purchased the Samsung Rugby 2 flip phone and am very happy with it. I bought it after researching the phone online. I found that it is very durable, complies to military standards, is shock resistant, rain resistant, etc. I only use the phone for phone calls and texting. I did not need the features of a smart phone, nor do I like paying $75. or $100. a month for a cell phone. I have AT&T ""Pay As You Go"" plan which I have had for the last 5 years. I pay $25. every 3 months and have never run out of minutes, its basically 10 cents a minute. Think about it, $8.33 a month! If my minutes do run low, I can always add more minutes if I need in any increment I want, $10. $15. etc. and they do rollover.The best feature of the Samsung Rugby 2 phone is the call quality. Every review I read mentioned this and it is true, it never drops a call and the call quality is remarkable. Samsung has done a great job building a rugged phone. The phone costs $265.00 retail from AT&T without a contract. I was able to find it on Amazon, brand new, unlocked, for $125.00. A great deal! The only way to get it cheaper is buy it through AT&T with a 2 year contract for $99.00.",38,5
Samsung,I recently bought this phone from Ehome Tech and I was happy with my purchase until I found out the phone would not charge a couple of days later after I received it. I contacted the company about it and they answered one of my emails about the phone but when I asked to exchange it they completely ignored me. I do not recommend buying from this company!,12,1
Samsung,"I like this phone, but WIRELESS PROFESSIONALS sold me a refurb as new. It came with a replacement battery (not factory installed) that would not charge. So they sent me another (replacement) battery. But soon I found that it overheated when charged --scary. Because it was past the return window when I realized the second battery wouldn't work, they would not help. I had to buy a new battery and charger on my own. Now I am finally able to use the phone. I can't get over the lack of customer support these days. I've had a recent rash of bad luck from sellers selling refurbs as new. I am beginning to get wary of ordering from any sellers other than Amazon or Amazon Fulfillment.",25,1
Samsung,"It's not an AT&T network phone, rather TELUS which is a Canadian Network. It is not completely Unlocked/unlockable. I will never be able to send or recieve pictures or get any media/internet if I were to choose so because it can not be unlocked completely. Also due to recent experience with the daylight savings change, to prob include travelling across the continental US, the time will not update on it's own. You have to manually update the time. I have tried so many things/times to try and unclock the phone but, to no avail.",19,1
Samsung,If you're looking for a rugged and well made phone then look no further than the Samsung Rugby. This phone was purchased after years of use and abuse of the first model. Very pleased with purchase.,19,5
Samsung,Rock solid and meet all the expectations. Worth for what I have paid for this. I bought this to get rid to any contractual extension and it worked flawless since almost over a year now,15,5
Samsung,The phone was listed as new. I just received the phone in the mail and there is dirt and residue between the buttons and on the side buttons. There are scratch marks on the back of the phone. Clearly not a new phone.,15,1
Samsung,I had to unlock the phone it was not unlocked. This took me about 2 hours with my technical skill and social engineering skills with ATT. This is not for the novice however and I would recommend the seller either update the ad for it being unlocked or unlock them. If I was able to then everyone else is. The phone works as intended no issues just the unlocking hassle.,10,2
Samsung,"Beautiful phone and an excellent buy. My need(s) are met with a solid flip phone to make and receiveoccasional calls. Previous phone was an LG flip and it was a buster. The Rugby III is tough (yes I have dropped it, etc).It does have several app features, but the best part is it will receive calls in areas with weak cell coverage (AT&T network).Communication is always strong and clear.",17,5
Samsung,"Very happy with purchase. Phone was obviously brand new in original packging. It was purchased to replaced my husband's Samsung Rugby 2, which ended up in the washer and dryer in the pocket of his pants. (The Rugby can take alot, but the heat of the dryer definately fried the screens and connections). Purchase arrived within expected time period. We have ATT, and if purchased from them, the same phone would have cost $260.00. All we had to do was pop the old sim card in the new phone and we were in business! Thanks Amazon and Ross Cellular. Excellent purchase.",10,5
Samsung,"My father is a remodeled who doesn't want a smartphone in a bulletproof case, he wants a simple flip phone that makes calls (he doesn't even use the text messaging). Problem is, he remodels houses all day and all his past phones have met tragic demises off ladders, tailgates, etc. I watched him drop this phone onto the floor from a 6' ladder while trying to dig it out of his pocket to answer a call. I reached down and answered it (I know that isn't the only time it has been dropped). His favorite thing to do is turn on the speaker so he can continue working while talking to you. It is reasonably clear and loud on both sides of the call (unless he forgets and walks to the other side of the room). The interface is pretty simple and straight forward, but the phone has a good amount of features. Does it have all the modern bells and whistles, no and that's the point. It is one of the last good rugged basic flip phones that I have found.",44,5
Samsung,"I received this phone yesterday. Even though it says it is used, it came in original packaging and the stickers were still on the back of the phone. The battery was fully charged when it arrived. Inside the package was a note from the seller asking me to contact them if I had any problems and they would be happy to make it right. I've bought a lot of stuff from Amazon and that was the first personal note from a seller. It was impressive. The phone is in excellent condition. It looks brand new. I don't use the internet on my phone so I cannot speak to that. I already had At&t as my carrier so I have no idea about the locked or unlocked state of the phone. I transferred my sim card and turned it on. Good to go. What I can say is that the phone I replaced was an original rugby that I have used for over five years. I never had any trouble with it until recently. The camera and the speaker were going bad. I checked At&t for a replacement phone. This phone was cheaper by far, plus I didn't have to renew my contract or pay a $36 fee to upgrade it. This phone has all the same features of the original, probably more I just haven't really looked, so it's easy for me to use, and the speaker is fantastic. It rings loud enough on the highest setting that even I with my not so perfect hearing can hear it from across the house. I can hear calls perfectly without having to put them on speaker phone. It is a rugby so I know that it can take a licking and keep on going. If you want a phone for talk and text that will last through the oopses of life, this is the best one on the market. I look forward to many years of service from my new phone. I will also recommend the seller to my friends.",42,5
Samsung,"I bought this phone for my husband to replace one that had gone through the wash. We like the ruggedness of the phone. My husband has big hands, and this phone is easy for him to use. The only thing we do not like is the ringtone volume is not very loud. Even with it adjusted to its highest level, it is sometimes hard to hear. There are a limited number of ringtones available on this phone, but that is not a huge drawback. Overall, this is a good, tough phone for a man who does not want a delicate phone.",12,4
Samsung,"Literaly? No... But this is a great phone! I absolutely enjoyed my iPhone and having all kinds of information at my fingertips. What I did not enjoy is the extra cost for data every month. I switched to a simpler plan with a basic phone and am saving loads. But none of that has anything to do with the phone. The phone itself is great! I HAD an original Rugby when they came out and I loved it! So when I decided to switch from the iPhone there was only one logical choice; the Rugby III. This phone is extremely rugged, has a good enough display for me, good volume (on ringer, speaker phone, and headset), easy to carry, and they list goes on. Good stuff!",12,5
Samsung,"It meets my needs. I haven't truly challenged its ruggedness yet, but so far it's been fine. I went back to a flip phone because I tired of the pocket dials and settings changes of my smart phone, whose ""smart"" features I replaced with a tablet. The PTT button on the Rugby may be placed well for a PTT user, but it is in the way for others and is often pushed accidentally. Should have a ""disable"" setting.",22,4
Samsung,My husband is a plumber and hard on phones. He loves this phone. He's had all the previous version and I hope they continue to make these phones,21,5
Samsung,"Great phone if you get one that does not turn itself off. I do not see alot of reviews on this phone, but there are a few with the same complaint I attributed to user error. I have been corrected. After reading more it appears the entire Ruby series of phones turns itself off on a steady basis. It is not due to a software update being needed. We will be returning this phone.",16,1
Samsung,"The main product description says unlocked for use worldwide, however if you click through and and buy one from one of the sellers BEWARE! as they change the device to locked. This is in effect not the same phone as the unlocked one as it will not work.",16,1
Samsung,"To regain control of my life, I decided to retire my smartphone and return to flip phone Nirvana. The Rugby 4 battery lasts for days and it seems to work well in dead zones. Absolutely great for voice and text, but the music capability is surprisingly good too. Download the free Kies software from Samsung to port files easily from you laptop. I also bought the Samsung headset for $10. Highly recommend AT&T prepaid plan which includes a free online contact directory service that simplifies keeping the phone's address book current. Bonus: the Bluetooth feature works with my car's navigation system and supports calls for my cell through the car speakerphone. Cons: email stinks, no apps, no games.. just sanity",18,5
Samsung,"As opposed to a stupid smart phone. This phone is great for what phones were invented for, TALKING!!. You can text, browse the web, take and send pics and vids. And when it's in your pocket, it's small, unnoticed, and the screen is nicely covered so it doesn't get cracked. And it works in the elevator. And it doesn't hang up when your cheek touches the screen.And I only charge it twice a week!",12,5
Samsung,"Had this same phone for more than 2 years and loved it After much abuse, it was dying and so glad to have found the same one. Great touchscreen, Super GPS, all the features you need.",12,5

I ordered the new phone but it did not come in its original box, it does not look brand new, it did not come with the manual book for the phone, and it did not come with its original phone charger, the charger is different and only about 2 feet long, very short compared to normal chargers, its the cheap charger that they have for sell for $5, so I guess they take the nice one out of the box from your new phone and give you the cheap crappy charger so they can sell the other one for a better price, not sure. It did ship on the 4th of the 3 to 5 day business shipping days so that was good. So far the phone is working well but if I need another phone I will not be ordering it through Just Cellular, and I would advise others not to as well",17,3
Samsung,"When I first got the phone I was really frustrated, it came up with a stupid error saying that service was unavailable, not only that but it was in Hungarian. I went to my service provider and they fixed everything! It has been a really fun phone, I love the radio and mp3 player. I highly suggest buying a stylus, it makes it much easier to use! Also plan on buying memory-you can't use the mp3 player or the computer software without it. Memory can be bought pretty cheap here in amazon. Overall I love it, I get compliments on it all of the time and because it wasn't released here in America, it is very unique!",36,5
Samsung,we received the package quickly and had no trouble setting everything up. the phone works well and looks exactly like we expected it to look. this is a great product to buy.,13,5
Samsung,"I bought this phone and got surprised with hungarian language when I switched phone ON for a first time - needed google translate in order to make phone working and switch to english. then phone was randomly rebooting - brought it to local service to update firmware and then finnaly phone started to work fine.In overal - phone itself is completely OK and working just like expected according to specifications, and most important - my kid is really happy with it,but startup problems spoiled my experience with phone a lot.",20,2
Samsung,"I just purchased this phone and I love the look.... However, the only thing I cannot do is receive or send picture messages.. but im not complaining too strongly because I did read the reviews before purchasing the phone but on one of the previous reviews someone mentioned that they loved the fact you can insert picture into your messages so i figured maybe there was a way you can send or receive them after all, but I can't:( Overall, I love my phone.. it's loud, it's cute,camera is very clear which is a huge plus, it has the radio and other cool features..Very easy to use. I recommend anyone who does not really use picture message to purchase the Hello Kitty Samsung S5230.. Ok after a couple of I had to come back and tell everyone that I finally figured out how to use the pic msg... Im with T-mobile so i went to google and found ""T-Mobile generic MMS settings"" and follow the instructions from there... they also have instructions for carriers:)",14,5
Samsung,I got this phone to replace my old iPhone. I did not originally think this phone would be as good. I just received it today and I have to say I like even better then my old iPhone. It was easy to switch it to English and set up just the way I wanted it. It was also easy to import my music and pictures from my computer onto the phone using the USB cable and the software included. I also liked that the seller included an adapter for the charger so I can use it in the US (since the charger is a European one). Earphones for listening to music and stuff were included as well which is good since the outlet is different than the standard so I think it would have been hard to find ones that went. It is also light weight and small enough to be easy to fit in a purse or pocket with a screen that is big enough to see everything. Plus it being Hello Kitty really adds to the cute factor. I recommend this phone who wants a cute little phone that is really practical with a lot of cool features for a good price.,18,5
Samsung,"Perhaps I'm spoiled, coming from a Nokia phone with its incredible ease of use interface, but this Samsung has been a total nightmare to figure out...and this is me being a longtime gadget geek who usually doesn't even bother to read owners' manuals for anything---TVs, computers, audio equipment, DVD players, MP3 players, VCRs, digital cameras, etc.This phone gets two stars mainly for its looks---the case and the screen. It seems to have been designed mainly for the bimbo market, people who just want to have a pretty phone in their hands. The owner's manual is a thin and horribly useless joke, most of it is about how to use the web browsing, mp3 player, and camera. Simple basic phone functions, like how to access the keypad during a call (for navigating voice menus) are totally ignored.In fact, when I first turned on the phone, it was in German---and there is nothing in the damn manual about how to change the language. I had to go to Google Translator and translate each and every icon and menu heading in order to figure it out! At least they could have been bright enough to have the default setting on English, which is after all THE international language!Similarly, there are no instructions on how to turn off the annoying keypad tones. I just kind of stumbled across it.I bought this phone mainly for its PDA functions, which are passable at best. I do like that it's much easier to do texting on this since you can get a full QWERTY touch keyboard when you turn it on its side. But overall the basic phone functions are severely neglected and ease of use is abysmal. I will give this phone another couple of days, if it doesn't finally ""click"" it'll be going back.UPDATE, 10/1/2010:Well, I have learned to live with this phone's many quirks and flaws. Which would have been a far easier/quicker process if the damn thing had come with a halfway decent owner's manual, sheesh. So I've changed my rating from 2 stars to 3.Basically this is a good phone for sending text messages. It is most certainly NOT much of a Palm Pilot replacement, that's for sure. Reception and voice quality are both decent.One thing that I noticed, and now have grown to tolerate, is how often the buttons and functions lag, especially on the touchscreen---about 2 to 3 times out of ten, you tap an onscreen icon and nothing happens the first or second or even third time, you just have to keep tapping it until the damn processor wakes the hell up and does what it's being told to do. Annoying as hell at first, but oh well, as Dostoyevsky famously wrote (he was in a gulag at the time, lol): ""Man can get used to anything."" That could well be the motto for this phone, heh.UPDATE: 8/26/2011Over a year later, it has held up well and now that I have resigned myself to this phone's limitations, I am finding that it does a passable job of being the PDA replacement that I orginally had in mind. How? Through the built in Calendar, mainly...I am able to make alarmed reminders for myself. That is the main reason I wanted it. Oh and the contacts list is reasonably detailed too, which isn't bad. But the main reason I am giving it a better review now is because I have decided against getting an iPhone, iPad, or even Android phone/pad for at least another year while waiting for that technology to mature and the prices to drop. In the meantime, this Samsung gets the most basic jobs done ok, I guess. Though if I had to do it all over again maybe I would've tried a Nokia, they usually have the most intuitive user interface out there.",11,3
Samsung,I think this phone is great! I got it as a gift for my boyfriend and he can't put it down. It has everything you need in a phone and more. Touchscreen works great and it has tons of useful applications. Battery lasts like 5 or 6 days. I can't explain how happy I am with this purchase. My mom already said she wanted the same phone for her birthday and I am giving thought to the idea of getting one for myself as well.,13,5
Samsung,"My Nokia POS phone starting giving up the ghost and I was faced with either signing up for another two year contract to get a reasonable price or pay through the nose for a non-contract price.After doing some research, I settled on the S5620 Monte. When it arrived, I popped in my SIM card and voila! Well, whatever the Portuguese word for voila is. The language was set to Portuguese and I had to fumble my way through the menus trying to find what I thought was a menu option. After fumbling for about 10 minutes, I had it switched to English and was off.This is a great little phone for a couple bills. I don't have to sign up for the contract, and I can kiss off AT&T and go to T-Mobile if it suits my fancy.The WiFi is awesome. It's sad that US carriers can get away with forcing defeatured phones down our throats and force us into outrageous data plans. Since I live in Mountain View, I get free WiFi within the city from Google, so I don't have too much of a need for a data plan when I can use the built in WiFi.The camera takes great pictures at 3.2 megapixels. Video quality is good as well with a decent frame rate, but not the highest resolution (QVGA). Good enough for YouTube or Facebook.Voice quality is not the best. Also, I had to go to the UK for a case that conforms to the phone design. It also doesn't have a Qwerty keyboard input for texting. A couple small sacrifices for a smart phone without a contract, a steep price or a monthly gouging.Very happy with this phone.",59,5
Samsung,"There are many good things about this phone and the best is battery life. I would use this phone for around 5 days without needing a recharge. Wow! And I surf the web and use the camera as well.Wifi works flawlessly. In built apps for Twitter,Facebook and google is great. However Google app does not work with wifi.. May be google has it hard coded to work with data plan only. But you have a work around. You can down load gmail app which works with WiFi.There is a smark unlock feature with gesture unlock. I love it. All you have to do is write a pre-set letter(you decide which letter) on the screen with your finger and phone unlocks and dials the number to have set for that letter! Amazing.There are many gadgets to use like tip calculator, timer, social networking sites apps, music player, Youtube app, Dictionary(I love it), messenger, voice recorder etc.Phone has Image editor. So you can take a picture, edit it to make it look better and then directly upload the picture to Picasa, facebook or Flickr. You can upload vidoes directly to Youtube. Picture quality is decent.It has active sync feature which I haven't used yet so I can't comment on that.You would not be disappointed with this phone.",11,5
Samsung,"PROS:I'm very happy with this phone. It is slim with a cool look. The audio quality of the mp3 player its very good. I use a lot the wifi connection(don't have a 3G plan) with very good results.In the morning I use the weather widget while I'm still in bed, via my home wifi, very usefull.CONS:I can not make the GPS work. I've tried almost everything, it still can't get the gps position...",31,4
Samsung,"The phone works fine with AT&T and associated data plan. Doesn't always get the ""G"" for 3G, but always gets the ""almost"" 3G (edge). Took a little effort to program the messaging and internet. Works fine with Wifi. The power adapter is the same one that I have for my Motorola razor - so that helps a lot. The music player is pretty good - has no problem locating my music files (and I didn't have to indicate where to search). The GPS takes awhile to get going sometimes, but it does work (Note: use the supplied Google maps - trying to upgrade will back-level the program and make it not work.)There are some good apps, and the phone is pretty intuitive. Nice looking. I bought it for the WIFI and GPS features - didn't want much more feature or keyboard - so it met my requirements. Battery lasts 2 full days.",13,4
Samsung,"This phone is good and works with different SIM Cards as advertised,but comes without the Manual and/or the Software which took me a long tome to find on the NET without paying somebody.The disturbing fact is that it is falsely advertised as having a 1 year US Warranty, however it is not supported by Samsung USA at all and I was advised to contact Samsung Philippines by e-mail (no toll-free number)and their response was below any expectation, but lucky I have managed to resolve the Bluetooth problem myself. The Manual I have found has mistakes regarding the correct settings in some areas.I wish Amazon will review the Warranty Policy for this product and advise how to proceed if the Service is neededI.T.",272,3
Samsung,"I purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones, because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation, and I went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap, its 800 mHz processor is quite fast and efficient. The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!Adquir?? este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pas?? de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tama?ño del telefono sin ser peque?ño, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Costa Rica). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!En fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo (sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia) ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempe?ño medio, pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario... Por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono; lo cual me parece asombroso!!!",197,5
Samsung,"I bought the phone because mainly because of the price/features balance and the 3g network support. I must say I'm greatly impressed. I'm currently living in Argentina and 3G works like a charm with CLARO AR company.Pros: the phone is a pleasure to work with, it is fast and reliable. A nice feature it that charges from the USB port and this is really useful when you hit the road. Screen Protectors and other accessories are very easy to find anywhere.Cons: battery life with BT and WiFi on is hmmmm...poor, you will exhaust a brand-new completely-full battery in less than two hours. GPS is still trying to locate myself! with no-luck. Android version is 2.3.4 and is a bit old now.",10,5
Samsung,"It is what is! This cellphone just ROCKS!! I don't even know where to begin, well let's see. CORNING?? GORILLA?? GLASS making basically durable and reliable, android built, with tons and tons of apps (I haven't been able to check on half of them)... Light and appealing design, great touch screen capability, awesome sharing features>>>>> Button line, BEST CHOICE EVER",10,5
Samsung,"I bought the phone because it said it was unlocked and it would work worldwide, turns out that the bandwidth that the phone can detect does not support the 3g network in europe, at least in Germany where i live. I bought it expecting it to work properly and here it can only detect gsm signal. So all of the features on the phone work slower and i can't really use it like i wanted. So if you want an international phone do not buy it, if it is for the states i guess it is ok!",152,2
Samsung,"Have two of these phones for a couple of weeks. One phone works perfectly, no issue whatsoever. The other one has the SOD ' Sleep of Death' issue multiple times. SOD = phone shuts itself off. Google solutions and tried them all but nothing works. Downloaded the lastest OS - Gingerbread 2.3.4 thru Samsung Kies but issue remains. This one is going back for an exchange. Neither of the phone is rooted.Overall I really like the phone, value vs. price and I think you are not going to get a better deal. A good beginner android phone that is almost iphone like.Pros: Screen size 3.5"" is perfect for me. The overall phone size isn't too big either. Plenty of free apps to download. Gingerbread improves the battery life.Cons: Internal memory is small. You won't be able to download a lot of apps. And you can't install the apps to the external SD card unless you root the phone (become a superuser) but that immediately voids the warranty. I read somewhere that you can un-root the phone if needed... Last minor issue, the touch screen isn't as sensitive as I like it but this could be the problem with having a Zagg shield on.Update 9/9/11: Received the replacement but it is also going back to Amazon. This time I didn't even power up the phone, the problem is on the touchscreen, there are 6 spots (about the size of a dime) that cannot be cleaned, looks like it is actually on the other side of screen. This is really getting old, all I want is another phone withour issue. And dealing with the exchange process is a nightmare. At least exchanging wireless phone is totally different than exchaning anything else Amazon sells. Stay tune...",118,3
Samsung,"I ordered this phone on Saturday March 7, 2012 and was pretty excited as this was to be my first smart phone. I know that's funny even to me. I added next day delivery and got it on Monday as projected, so everything up until this point had been satisfactory. Opening the package, I found everything to be as it should be at first glance. However, when anyone drops this kind of money, they are going to do a thorough review of the product no matter what it is. Upon closer inspection of the box, I noticed that the language on the back of the box was in spanish but that is not what really stood out. What really stood out is the fact that it said the model number whas not an S5830L as ordered but instead it was an S5830M. I had researched this phone before purchase and was not familair with an M model. I though maybe it's just the box...Lol. Not a chance. I took the phone out of the box and took the back plate off to check the Samsung manufaturer sticker for the model and sure enough it was in fact a S5830M model. I thought, what could be the difference. I tossed in the battery and started it up. The native language on the phone was Spanish...LolOk, now I was concerned. Was this a knockoff or what? So I next called Samsung and gave them the S/N off of the sticker on the inside. The customer service rep told me that it came up as "" No Information Available"". The rep then told me that that was because it was not a model that they supported in the U.S. I asked, ok so what does that mean? The rep told me that this phone was not meant for sale in the U.S. and that there would be absolutely no support for it here! No warranty, nothing. Now let me say this. I switched the language setting in the phone over to English and tested the phone out. Everything seems to work as it should. It also has the latest platform for gingerbread 2.3.6 . The ICS platform (also called the Icecream Sandwich platform is not available at this time for the Galaxy Ace). So everything seemed to check out with the exception that if anything ever happens to this phone then I am just screwed...LolNext I called Amazon and gave them the information about the phone and what I was told by the phon's manufacturer Samsung. Amazon appologized up and down and extended a 20% refund as well as offered to replace it with a full refund within 30 days should something not work. They (Amazon) also told me that they were going to investigate the seller as well as the rest of the stock that they have on hand for this phone. I want to be clear that Amazon has been very helpfull in this matter in standing behind their site and customers. Today, I called the 3rd party seller that is selling this phone. They are out of New York. I talked to the manager and he said that the SKU numbers matched up with their product and that it had to be Amazon's fault. He went on to say that he would send me the correct phone if I would call Amazon and return the discount that Amazon gave me first. Now come on people, I didn't just get off the boat. I did tell him that I would be happy to give the discount back but I would have to have what I ordered first. No Way would I give it back first and then still be stuck with a phone that had no warranty and would not have any assistance for should something go south with it. He agreed and said that he would send me an email with the tracking number within the hour. Lo and behold, that hour came and went with no email.It just shows me that I was correct in my assumtion. In short, be careful and order from this merchant at your own risk. You are deffinately rolling the dice.Amazon still **ROCKS** though!",92,2
Samsung,"I have emailed the seller twice with no response so far. The phone is excellent but the battery sucks!! I mean literally the battery doesn't even exist. 20 minutes of call drains 80% of battery. i have turned off all the background processes, wifi, 3g, blue tooth, screen brightness 0%. So literally i am trying to use it as basic phone but even then it cant give me more than 30 mins of talk time and 10-12 hrs of standby time. 2 Emails to seller and no response so far. Will return it back after 1-2 days more.",60,1
Samsung,"The Samsung Galaxy Ace is a real pleasure to use. It is relatively small and light making it easy to carry. The display is very readable even outside in the sun. Call reception is very good and voice clarity at either end is very good as well. Auto rotation lags a bit and sometimes needs a little prodding. Battery life is great. The camera is good with resolution and clarity more than acceptable. Picture colors can be a little washed out as the auto white balance sometimes has trouble. I've taken to Ace to Germany and Austria and had not trouble connecting overseas cellular services. Very seamless. To date I have not been able to wirelessly connect to my home network and download/upload files. I must connect via USB and use the Kies software which is really clunky. But I'm still learning.

I believe this model description says it comes with fryo 2.2 but it actually comes with an upgrade to 2.3. The box also contained a black and white plastic cover for the phone. Both of these were a nice surprise. The picture is clear and really nice. Netflix works really well. Android system allows for an endless supply of apps. I wanted to get an otterbox cover for this phone but it dosnt appear they make one. Oh well. The phone has been great and I would highly recommend it.",53,5
Samsung,"We decided to give up the Nokia smart phone and try an Android. This phone is much easier to use than the Nokia and has every feature we wanted including FM Radio, camera, calendar, WIFI, and more. We also wanted it to be unlocked as we use the Go Phone pay as you Go cards so we control the cost! The only negative was that it came in a non-English language. We watched a You Tube that walked us through the steps to change it to English and after that it was fine. SIM card was easy to insert. Love having all the Android apps and love the touch screen and grip of the outer case. Have been using for about 2 months now.",11,5

It is bad business ethics and these guys are not realizing they are hurting amazon's reputation. I will never ever buy a phone sold on amazon through a third party vendor.

Samsung,"This is a really good phone in today's mid range of Android phones.The phone is excellent and performs really well. It came with Gingerbread 2.3.4 already installed, that means, better performance compared to 2.2.x (Quadrant benchmarks this phone over the Samsung Galaxy S, which has a 1GHz CPU), better battery life and improves the video shooting quality to full VGA resolution.The phone battery stands for more than one full day with almost everything on (full brightness, GPS, Wifi, and BT), and lots of calls and sms per day, however,the 2G/3G data connection is off as I have Wifi connection in the office all day and I'm not using the mobile data connection in transit to/from home, where I also have wifi connection.Nevertheless, I tested the 3G connection with Movistar network in Venezuela and it works very well.The screen is bright and sharp. It does have some reduced visibility in direct sun light but it is way better than older touch screens I've used.The multi-touch works great. It is really sensible and the screen size is enough to type comfortable in landscape mode and almost comfortable in portrait mode.The only thing I haven't tried so far is the GPS and navigation functionality.The phone arrived without the 2GB microSD Card, but can't go against the phone and score it with 5 stars.

Samsung,"I bought this phone 25 five days ago. It looked a good phone at the beginning, everything worked as expected. The only drawback at the time was the battery life. You have to be charging the phone every single day. Then suddenly the phone started to make a weird thing. It detected like if I were plugging in the charger cable showing the battery icon in the top right as if the phone were charging then 3 seconds later the phone said the cable was disconnected. Weird! At the first day of this weird behavior the phone did it like two times at the day. But then next day it went crazy, it had the same behavior but now the phone displayed it was plugged to the charger and then 1 second later it was not and it did it until I turn it off. I tried by removing the battery and give it the phone a rest like 15 minutes, then I put the battery back and turned it on again. It looked like the issue went away but one hour later guess what. It started again. So GOOD BYE, nice to meet you worst phone ever. I am returning it to Amazon. Although it was fulfilled by amazon the phone was sold by a third party, so check that first.",25,1

Samsung,"This phone is really good. The screen is capacitive, unlike the previous Samsung star, so it's really easy to use. The music player is great, and the phone supports multi-tasking (though it drags the performance down a bit). Perhaps my favorite feature about this phone is the WiFi. For those of you who don't have a data plan, and don't plan on getting one for the future, the WiFi is a really nice touch because it allows you to browse the internet without being forced in a 2-year contract. Most of the phone that have wifi are smartphone, which carriers are requiring a data plan with, but this phone is a feature phone. wifi is a great ""feature"" on a ""dumbphone"". The only problem I have with this phone is the annoying QWERTY keypad while texting. The keys are really small, and I frequently press the ""back"" key instead of the ""backspace"" key. I'm getting used to it though, and it's also helpful that this phone has a feature that is similar to android's ""swype"", where you slide your finger across the keyboard to type. the internet browser is good, and the phone supports youtube videos. the quality isn't the greatest for videos that have a lot of action, but for the occasional stand-up comedian video, this phone performs sufficiently. the phone sports a micro sd card slot, so I can load all my music on the card and play it on the phone. I have at&t in the us, and the phone started working immediately after i put the sim card in it. the batter life is above average, but it doesn't blow you away. overall, i'm very happy with this phone.",24,5
Samsung,"If you want to save money on the purchase of an expensive cell phone, this is a good buy. It comes with a battery, charger and USB cable and had I not known I was buying a used phone, I would have thought it was new. Free shipping is a plus, also. I will certainly consider this source again next time I am looking for a cell phone.The phone is unlocked so can be used with the sim card of any service supplier, whether in the US or outside. I purchased this as a gift for someone in the Dominican Republic and there was no trouble getting service from a local supplier.The phone requires a micro sd card if you want to save music and photos, etc. That does not come with the phone so should be purchased at same time, unless you already have a card you can move from another phone.",13,5
Samsung,"This is a great ""basic"" phone - Other basic flip phones always broke at the hinge after about a year and were made of cheap plastic. This phone is made of substantial materials and the slide design is very sturdy, plus helps protect the keyboard. I also like how the slide feature elongates the phone, so the mouthpiece is down by my mouth - don't feel like I need to remove the phone from my ear in order to talk into the microphone. And even though it's ""basic"" by today's standards, it has a GPS feature that serves as a 411 or map directions. Nice big screen, easy to view, has the basic camera... Sound is great and speaker feature very loud and clear. Great product, especially for the price. I took it for a swim with me, so I'm having to replace it and thankful I found it on Amazon, because the stores claim these basic phones aren't available anymore.",14,5

Her requirements were, easy to use, easy to read, must have bluetooth,and should not be to big.This phone seems to be just right.Her only negative was it has a very limited number of preloaded ring tones.

Samsung,"This is plenty of phone for those who want nice little extra features without going android. Fairly low EMF, functional camera that is not all that bad really for just taking fairly close up phone shots. Decent sound but does take a bit of getting used to as the sound quality itself projects differently than on some cellphones. Hard to explain but you almost want to figure out where the speaker is on it, precisely! Speaker phone is adequate if you are in a quiet setting. I don't use the other functions but they are all there including the web and blue tooth. Hubby uses the bluetooth on his for driving and says it works fine. Size is sturdy if you don't like the super slim phones that easily slip out of older fingers and will just fit tidily into a backpocket. Ringer is nice and loud at full volume and can be turned down to the point it only vibrates. The vibration will catch your attention in a pocket for sure but can also make it jump off a counter so keep it away from the edges of surfaces. Front display is good sized and clear and the well lit keypad is large enough even for middle agers to be pleased with. Nice size photo display inside also for placing your favorite snaps of loved ones. We have had ours several months without any notable issues using Tmobil. If they last as long as the previous Samsungs we will be more than happy with this purchase also. Plain phone for plain good use; nothing more and nothing less.",10,5

Samsung,the bluetooth shop its the worst seller i ever dealt with on amazon.the phone worked for only 2months and then it stopped recieving simcards.the phone was blocked by t mobile or blacklisted simply because they sold me a phone which they didnt pay the bills for and off-cause it is now after 30 days so i can't return the phone .i think thats fraudulent tried contacting them but they ignored any message i sent them because they are aware of what they had done.that is not how business is done because when they asked for $207 i did not pay them half.i bought the phone in aug 2013 and oct 25th 2013 the stopped working .so doing business with the bluetooth shop is at your own risk and your fault because it never ends well.,11,1
Samsung,When the phone was sent to me the charging. Port didn't work had to buy a separate charger for my phone so while my phone charges up no one can contact me if there's an emergency other then that it works great but I feel not being able to charge it normally should have been mentioned in the details before I spent $264.,13,2
Samsung,"Very fast shipping and excellent price for an unlocked S5. The only down side to this particular one is even though it is unlocked and is a T-Mobile device it does not come with the T-mobile ROM on it so you don't have the WiFi calling capabilities that you do with the T-Mobile Rom installed. Therefore making the statement in the add untrue. ""(This cell phones are fully compatible with T-Mobile.)"" This is not a deal breaker for me as I can root it and reload the ROM to the phone but would have been nice to know that prior to ordering it as it was for my wife and I didn't realize that this was lacking until she had already set it up.",11,4

Samsung,"This seemed like an Ok phone...for the three hours I was able to use it. It arrived with an initial charge on the battery, which allowed me to play with it for a few hours and test out the features. The touch screen worked well, but the qwerty keyboard was very small, which made texting difficult. I'm sure this is less of an issue once you get used to it, but I have pretty small hands/fingers and had to correct one out of every four letters while texting, so if you have large fingers, this probably isn't the phone for you. Other than that, it is a good basic phone. I don't use my phone for internet, email, or social networking, so I didn't try out these features. If you care about those features and like to customize your phone, definitely read the reviews. I noticed that a lot of people complained about not being able to change things like the screensaver - I don't care much about that, but some of the pictures that pop up on the screensaver are truly cheesy. I didn't care for the standard ringtones on this phone, but I'm sure you can download something.The real problem to watch out for is charging problems. When the initial charge died and I tried to charge it for the first time, I got an error message saying 'charging stopped due to irregular battery.' I tried it with several different chargers in several different outlets and got the same error message. If I tried charging it when the phone was off, I got a different error message, saying 'charging paused. Phone temperature too high or too low', though my phone was at room temperature. A new battery did not solve this problem, so I sent the phone back. In the course of trying to solve the problem, I did some searching online and discovered that many owners of this phone had the same problem - some when the phone was new, some after a few months, some after the phone went for a swim. The phone I purchased was supposedly brand new, so it should not have had any swimming experience. I guess I'm thankful that the charging problem occurred immediately, when I could still send it back, rather than randomly after a few months like some of the reviews I have read.I don't ask much from my cell phone - only that it work when I need it, send and receive texts when I need it to, and hold a charge reasonably well. Unfortunately, this phone didn't measure up and I'm not ordering another one. It's just not worth the hassle.",27,1
Samsung,"I was looking for a flip-phone that had good call and sound quality and would be easy to text with. This phone is perfect for both, without any extra features or apps (which I didn't want to spend money on to begin with).I have owned and used this phone for about a week now, with T-mobile.It's speaker volume and clarity as well as when you hold it up to ear are both excellent. This is a great simple phone if you are looking for basic functions only. It's nicely sized, not too bulky to fit in a small pocket, and is very light. Connected to my bluetooth ear-piece easily, and worked well. The only thing is the phone is made of plastic which makes me want to get a rubberized cover for it in case it falls or gets scratched. Over all I am very pleased with this phone!",91,5

Samsung,"I purchased this phone for an older friend of mine, 82 years old to be exact. He has been using it for the past week and loves it, he had a Motorola razr but it finally gave out on him. I was a little worried when I opened the box and the phone said T-Mobil since I was using my att sim card, but it worked fine. my friend says the the volume and ringer are both louder on this phone (which is a good thing when your are 82). I set the font to a larger size for him which he really likes and the price what very good. The only thing I would mention to any potential buyer is: don't purchase a Separate charger like I did, one comes packed with the phone. There is a camera but I didn't even try it since all it was bought for was to talk on. Good phone, good price and easy to use.",18,5
Samsung,"Ordered the Samsung T139 because of the low price, it was unlocked, I prefer a clamshell, it had Bluetooth and a speakerphone. However, I live in a fringe area and the signal reception was unreliable. The phone showed 0 or 1 bar most of the time. Other than that, it had everything I needed.Went and purchased another new model Samsung (also G2) from T-Mobile and the signal strength was the same. I returned that new model.Tried out an LG GD570 and the signal was at least twice as strong and G3. I'm going with the LG and will keep the T139 as a backup as it didn't cost much. However, the LG has a tremendous amount of features that will keep you busy setting things up for days! It also works great with Microsoft Sync except no texting.",15,3

Samsung,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S 4G from Worldwide Distributors to put it on a new line of my wife's t-mobile family plan (I currently have an iPhone on at&t). I do not know much about android phones, but the reviews seemed to indicate that this was the closest to the iPhone of any available. So far I like the phone. It is somewhat lighter than the iPhone (it has a plastic back cover instead of the solid glass and metal) and feels somewhat cheaper, but is a solid phone nonetheless. I am getting used to the android interface but have a lot yet to learn before I am as comfortable as I am with my iPhone. My only disappointment so far is that there was no memory card in the box although the box and manual said it was included (also no sim card but that was expected although the box indicates that it should have one); I suppose it was left out to make the phone cheaper, but it seems like a sneaky thing to do. Now on to the pros and cons so far:Pros:- I LOVE the beautiful large display! Not quite as good as the retina display of the iPhone but close.- Works with t-mobile (my wife's plan) with no jailbreak/unlock needed- Android is new to me so it will be a new learning experience- Easy network data disable in the shutdown menu (nice touch!)- Very fast data transfer on wifi (have not tried 4G)Cons:- Cheaper feel, not as solid as iPhone (but then again, nothing is!)- Larger footprint- New interface will take some getting used to",14,4

Samsung,"The phone connected for a short while. I took it to three T-Mobile stores, one of which told me the phone was refurbished, although it came in what seemed to be factory packaging. They were unable to make the phone connect. I sent the phone back to Samsung, they told me the phone was fully operational, but they could not connect to T-Mobile, either.I called T-Mobile for the third time, and they told me that the phone was blocked because I was not the owner, and that the phone initially worked because there was a time lag in their blocking system. It appears the phone is either stolen, or the previous owner leased it and is not making payments.Besides the paying for phone service for the last two months, and having a non-working phone, I also lost my apps and data. I have several hundred dollars in a pre-paid account the phone will not connect to, which is disappearing at the rate of $50 a month, so I hope this can be resolved quickly.UPDATEAmazon has been very helpful, and has treated me fairly. My phone is now working.Unitek told me T-Mobile was blocking the phone because I didn't buy it from them. T-Mobile says the phone was blocked because it's stolen. Samsung says the phone is in perfect order.I sent the phone back to Unitek, and they returned it wiped, but working. The IMEI number on the phone's paper label, and the IMEI label on box the phone came in, are different. When the phone came back from Unitek, the IMEI number had been changed internally and did not match either of the other two numbers.Changing IMEI numbers on stolen phones is so common that there is proposed legislation, the ""Mobile Device Theft Deterrence Act of 2013"" that will, if passed, make reprogramming a phone's IMEI a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.More detail. Many Android phones are identified by an IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number. When a phone is stolen, a carrier blocks the phone using the IMEI. This can take several months to happen. So, even though you receive a working phone that appears to be new, that doesn't mean it will continue to work.There is a database of stolen phones, the Central Equipment Identity Register. If a device is blacklisted in that database, it won't connect to any network. Consumers do not have access to the database.You may find a phone's original IMEI under the battery. The actual number can often be found in the phone's setup menu. Sometimes dialing *#06# will produce it. If it works, the IMEI will appear when you enter the last #.If you have a similar problem, this may help. T-Mobile's telephone support will not help you unless you can supply your account PIN (Personal Identification Number), which you may not have readily available. It was a problem for me because we were spending most of the winter in Florida to be with my wife's ailing mother. T-Mobile staff at their stores will initially refuse to help without your PIN, but if you present sufficient identification, they should give you the number. Sales staff may be unaware they can do that, but when I asked them to check policy, gave me my PIN.Store personnel will call phone support. T-Mobile's phone support varies widely with respect to training and English fluency, but the store can more easily access a higher tier. For reasons I don't understand, T-Mobil's phone support cannot reliably tell you if your phone has been blocked, but I got that information on the fifth call to them, not including visiting three T-Mobile brick and mortar stores.Store staff will swap your SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card, which will lose anything stored on your old SIM card, but the phone will remain blocked . Before you let that happen, back up your information. With your permission, they will reset your phone to its original state, which loses everything stored on the phone. It does not unblock the phone.Samsung supplies a program, Kies. It will backup some of the information on your Samsung Android phone. It can also be used to update the Android operating system. I strongly suggest you use Kies before you take your Samsung phone to a T-Mobile store.When I add up the cost of the phone, T-Mobile service I couldn't use because the phone wouldn't connect, shipping the phone to Samsung and Unitek, and the apps on it, the phone has cost $630.33 to date. I have no confidence the phone is legal, or will continue to work with the new IMEI.According to an Internet advertisement, T-Mobile will sell me the same phone, no contract, for $463.99, and give me $50 worth of free time, which is $413.99 for the phone. Unitek was a bad mistake, but I learned from it.",17,1
Samsung,This is a pay as you go phone (as per the serial number) and hence not suitable for adding this phone on to my Verizon plan. Nothing was said about this in the description.

Samsung,"I inherited a Blackberry curve from my sisters ex's cousin, I'm with verizon, I couldn't afford that xtra $30 data plan which I only used 75 mb's a month anyway, so I bought this inexpensive, I think it was like $14.95, so I reported my blackberry as lost or stolen, and switched that phone number to this phone, a little advice if you have a data plan smartphone you can no longer afford, cut spending! Switch and go back to the basics, just a plain phone! So if you're in a data plan and don't think you can find a way out do xactly as I did,call your provider, ""verizon, sprint, t-mobile"" Whatever..... Report the phone with the data plan you can no longer afford ""Lost or Stolen"" and this is what gets me........

Samsung,"I love the phone. For people who don't want an expensive data plan but need to upgrade their stone age flip phone, the brightside is a great in-between. It's a good size, fits nice in my hand and pocket, and so far I haven't had any problems with it. the camera is pretty good for a phone, best one I've had so far. The key-board slides out nice, it doesn't stick or anything. The only complaint I have is the menu screen. Most phones have a home screen where you choose a background and everything, but this phone doesn't have that. The orange screen shown in the picture is your home screen, you can choose between orange or green and choose what shortcuts are on the home menu, but that's the limit of your home screen options.",46,5

Samsung,"I was in a delima because I was in the middle of my ATT contract so not eligible for an in expensive upgrade and my blackberry was really in need ofbeing trashed. I didn't have the money to pay hundreds of dollars for a new phone and a friend told me about possibly purchasing an unlocked phone.I must say I was nervous about purchasing an unlocked phone because I heard many negative stories of how there could be issues with internet service and other services that my provider ATT has. However, so far I have not had any issues. As for the phone itself, I LOVE IT. I needed an organizer first and foremost and this phone delivers. I love the style of the phone as well. The phone is very user friendly. I must say, I am not a very techy person so I don't have high demands for millions of apps, but the one draw back to this phone is that I have not be able to find many themes for my phone and the apps are few and far between, I'm not sure if its ATT mall or if its because of the model of phone.However overall I am a happy camper because the phone was affordable (new) and I am very pleased with my purchase.",13,5
Samsung,"I purchased this phone for my wife. Got the white version (seller actually shipped black by mistake which we returned, black with green is horrible looking).My wife is not very tech savvy and needed a good looking small phone with touchscreen. All she wanted is a new generation good looking basic phone.Pros: 1) Very Good looking in white color2) Small size - easy to keep in pocket3) It actually works good as a phone4) Biggest advantage is that it has Android OS5) Web-browsing is great. Sometimes, I play youtube videos on it connecting it to wi-fi at home. Screen is sharp and speakers are great.6) Camera is average, videos recording it very good (resolution is not very high but in small size, its quite clean).Cons: Battery life could have been great.We purchased it more than 6 months back. Its all plastic but build quality is good. We have a small baby who mishandles this phone often but there are no issues yet mechanically or cosmetically.If you wish to have a small sized and sleek phone with touch screen, wifi connection to internet, android OS, average camera, you will not go wrong with it. If you want a phone with much higher capabilities, look somewhere else.",11,5
Samsung,"A friend owns the same phone and I was able to test it out before purchasing one. As other reviewers have brought out, the battery life is quite bad. Be prepared to charge your phone every night if you run a lot of apps. I'll be looking into getting a new battery with higher capacity. The Qwerty keyboard while texting can be a tad small, easily fixed by turning the phone on the vertical, buttons are slightly larger then. The other 'complaint' about this was that it came without an ear-piece, easily rectified by getting one cheap online. As for it being truly unlocked, I haven't been able to test that function out yet. We travel frequently to Asia and I hope it works there. All in all, I am very pleased with my purchase, esp for the price paid.Update 10/14/11: Wanted to note too, the adapter that is provided for N. America customers is totally worthless as the charger comes with the 3 rectangular prongs. The adapter provided will not fit, so be prepared to buy your own adapter.

Samsung,"I received the phone on time, but the phone has a manual in French without any English. And the phone's default set up is in French too. It took me two hours to figure out how to set it up to English. After everything is all set up as English, there are still 2 French apps left on the phone. I guess one is a French emergency service(like ours 911) and another one is the manual on the phone, which are pretty annoying. I tried to update the system, the two Frenc apps are still there.Another problem is that it does not work unless you know how to set up the mobile network service. It pop up 2 networks, one is ATT PHONE, another one is Wap/cingular. If you use ATT, you need to chose wap/cingular. The ATT Phone one is not working. And after I chose the wrong one, it does not let me choose another one. I have to hand type in the Wap/cingular setting in the ATT phone setting to make it work.But in the end it works. And it works fine. I enjoy it so far. If the manual and language are all good and correct, I would give this a better rating. I am not sure if these are general problem or it is the problem from the specific seller's product.",12,3

I already did some tests and it works.The only reason I am not giving five stars is because the phone came with six apps from a developer in Portugal that I don't want but can't remove from the phone.I would recommend this phone to those who want a small device with a little intelligence and not so difficult to understand and use.",24,4
Samsung,"Due to some discussion about very different flavors of this phone being shipped by different sellers, this review is for a phone sent to me by UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC via Amazon. Delivery was prompt and the item was in brand new condition (if it wasn't they sure did a great job making it look that way). Mine came with a very brief manual (if you want to call it that) in English, with the phone set to UK English. This is my first even semi-smart phone, but I have some experience as an Android tablet user so it wasn't all new to me.I have several USB cables with male USB mini connectors. This phone uses a USB micro connector for charging and data transfer so I bought some mini-to-micro adapters so I could use the stuff I have, but the adapters turned out to be useless. The female USB micro port on the phone is recessed in the housing such that the male USB micro fits only if it will fit inside this very, very small housing. The adapters I bought, though small, were too big to allow the male plug to be inserted deep enough into the female to make a connection (or even stay in place - they fall right out). I'm thinking I'm going to have to get genuine Samsung cables from somewhere but haven't finished looking around yet.The power adapter, which has the proper size USB micro male on it, is a European plug design and it comes with a plug adapter, presumably so it can be used in the US. While you can indeed plug it into a 110/120V outlet in the US with the adapter, it has absolutely no effect on the phone. It doesn't charge at all. I'm guessing it expects more voltage, but whatever. The cable is built into the transformer and so is useless as a spare data or charging cable. Also, apparently not all charging cables will transfer data as well as charge. Be careful when looking at charging cables or kits to make sure you get one that can both charge the device *and* transfer data between the phone and your computer. If it just says it's for charging, it is probably not for both purposes.That means that this package contains one and only one usable cable for charging and data sync, via a standard USB connection on the PC side of things and a micro USB male on the phone side. You will probably want to plan to buy a spare or two but I don't have a recommendation on that yet because the USB micro female port on the phone won't accept just any USB micro male. It has to be in a really, really small housing.I couldn't use the camera app or install the Amazon App Store (or several other items) until I put a 32GB micro SD card in the phone (all 32GB were recognized). Get an SD card installed before you start trying to install much of anything; it solves a number of problems.The Android Market and the Amazon App store initially reported that several apps were not compatible with my device. I downloaded and installed Samsung Kies on my Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit machine with no problems. Then closed it down and started it again and it asked if I wanted to update it and I said yes. So it updated, and then asked if I wanted to upgrade the firmware in my phone. I said yes. After I did this (by this point I had already installed the SD card), app installations have been smooth as silk, even the often aggravating Words With Friends which seems to decide that any device you have is incompatible about every other week.I recommend you look for ""App2SD"" or a similar application that allows you to move (or which automatically moves) applications to your SD card instead of letting them hog space in the limited onboard phone memory. Some apps must live in the phone but others can live on the SD card.I had trouble with the Bluetooth phone application in my car (a late model Hyundai) and found that others have too. I paired the phone with the car successfully and could make and receive hands-free calls through the system with no trouble. I could not get my phonebook/contact list to download from the phone into my car, though. After much aggravation and searching, I found a post on a board that suggested a free Android app called Bluetooth File Transfer. Download and install that app; start it; hit Menu; hit More; hit Send Contacts; Select All (or whatever you want); hit Send As Single. The app blasted my contact/phonebook list out into the ether where the car saw them floating around (the car was configured to auto-download) and sucked them all in. Et voila! Yes, I do have to remember to refresh the car's copy from time to time but I can live with that.The screen scratches pretty easily; you may want to consider a protector.And oh yes, I bought a 1500mAh battery because of so many people saying the battery life was lousy. At least for now, my battery life with the originally supplied battery is excellent IMHO with Bluetooth and WiFi on 24/7. But you always need a spare battery lying in a drawer somewhere.This sounds almost like a list of complaints but I don't mean it to be. I like this phone and would recommend it highly. All I need now are a few cheap cables and a few accessories, which I always seem to need when I get something like this. It has taken about a week of on-again, off-again diddling to get it largely where I want it, but that's not unreasonable for a new tech toy. If you are new to Android expect it to take a bit longer, but that's not the phone's fault - it's just how it is. I hope some of these comments are useful if you are considering or have bought this phone.",23,4
Samsung,"Phone was in Czech language. It had installed an 'O2 Czech Republic' carrier ROM, instead of a carrier-free ""International"" ROM. Even though the description said ""international"", it was in Czech and with Czech applications installed that were part of the 'O2 Czech' ROM (couldn't be uninstalled). I went with another Android through image icons, to the language menu, in order to change it. Next step: flashing the ROM to a standard Samsung one in order to use it in the US. Also, manual IS ONLY IN Czech language! Finally, when contacted the seller about it, they never reply on locked ROM issue and they only answer: 'download manual'. Summary: O2 locked ROM and Czech is not 'international'. AWFUL customer feedback support.",20,1
Samsung,"FINAL UPDATE: Thought I should give this an update since I still think this phone was the best for being a phone and texting plus long life battery. Unfortunately, I have 4 kids and THEY have smart phones which many times send characters and things that do not translate well on non-smart phones so I had to upgrade to the Samsung S5 (for $1 here on Amazon)?ÿSamsung Galaxy S5, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless)?ÿwhich is a great phone but I had to spend a bit of money on extended battery/extra battery/apps/etc to make it as useful as this Alias as far as battery life. So IF you don't have some pressing need for a smart phone this is still the best thing going and I used one for over 5 years and in many ways still miss it.--------------------------------------------Well I have had an Alias 2 for over 2 years now and I love it, best phone I ever had. just so you understand I use my phone mainly as a PHONE, I do a lot of txting and it is great for that. The menus are all clear and it won't pocket dial people. I would like to point out that some of the early models had a problem with Bluetooth which was resolved with a software fix. I am looking around to buy an extra for when mine dies since Verizon does not carry them any longer on their website. The key board is great and I have not found anything that I like better for carrying in my front jeans pocket and I can set it to vibrate AND play any mp3 I wish as a ringtone. Whats not to like??UPDATE: Well here I am in Jan 2013 and still have this same phone, still like it and fight the urge to move on to a ""smart"" phone. Unless you really want a smart phone that will be lucky to get through a 24 hour period without being recharged this is still the best phone. I have the extended battery and I can go for 3-5 days without a recharge and the coverage is excellent. Anything I get to replace it in the future will be a step down as an actual phone (which is why we got these things wasn't it?).UPDATE: It is Oct 2013 and my phone of 4 years was going strong but I dropped it just right to break the front screen (it was still working but looked bad) so I used a Alias 2 backup I had and took it to the Verizon store and got it cloned then bought a factory refurbished Alias 2 (to replace the backup) from one of the vendors on this page for $42, looks new but until they make a smart phone with a physical QWERTY keyboard and a battery that lasts for 3-6 days, I am keeping this phone. Still better than anything out there IMHO since I have a PC, iPad, laptop I can use to access the Net, I really don't need it on my phone.NOTE: IF you really want to love this phone, get this with it and you will hate to ever use anything else :)?ÿOEM Samsung U750 Alias 2 Extended Battery & Grey Door SCH-U750 Alias 2",79,5
Samsung,"I bought my Samsung Alias 2 in October 2009 when my previous phone stopped working. I chose it because (1) it's a Samsung, the brand with which I have consistently had the best luck and fewest problems, (2) it is a ""flip-phone"" design, which I prefer because the screen and keyboard are protected when not in use (usually in my purse or pocket) and I don't have to worry about ""pocket dialing"" someone unintentionally, and (3) I prefer an actual keyboard rather than a touch-screen keyboard. The reasons I LOVE this phone are all of the above PLUS... I rarely lose a call unless I am in an area that seems to be a notorious ""dead zone"" for everyone, the camera takes fantastic pictures, the available GPS application is so cheap and easy to use, I can access my online email, I keep several ""must have"" games (including Scrabble and Sudoku) on shortcuts for quickest access, mp3 capabilities, and of course... great TEXTING!!!! The list goes on. I don't particularly want or need a smart phone and I think that's because I've been so incredibly happy with THIS phone. I am on Amazon right now, looking for another one, because something seems to have gotten into the slot for the charger so I can't insert it to charge. I am heartbroken! :o( I am way past due for an upgrade with my carrier and could probably get a much more sophisticated phone with my upgrade, but I'm just not ready to part with my Alias 2!! Besides, I have never had trouble finding accessories for my Alias 2 on Amazon (near impossible through my carrier, who only seems to stock parts and accessories for the newer, fancier phones they would rather you buy!). Bottom line: LOVE LOVE LOVE MY SAMSUNG ALIAS 2!Additional note, added 8/16/12:I almost forgot one of the VERY BEST things about the Samsung Alias 2... NO ""AUTO-CORRECT!!!!"" When I get texts from some of my friends and relatives who have phones that are a little newer/fancier models, and the ""auto-correct"" has done anything BUT ""correct"" their text content, I just crack up. I'll never forget the time my sister texted me that she was going to ""club"" my mother! Lol! I don't even remember what she later told me she'd MEANT to type. I ""locked"" that text in my inbox and look at it whenever I need a laugh. Who decided to call those ""SMART phones"" anyway??",32,5
Samsung,i cant rate the phone its self because i am returning it. it turns out that Verizon requires a $10 a month data plan for using the phone. you would think that they would not make you pay for a data plan on a non-smart phone that was bought third party.,13,4
Samsung,"A perfect phone for text messaging and actually talking on the phone. (I know! Amazing, right?). Seems sufficiently sturdy.I purchased this phone as a replacement for my smartphone and was able to save a considerable amount ($60) on my cellphone bill (Verizon) by downgrading and dropping my data plan. All of the fun apps that I had on the smartphone I transferred to my WiFi only tablet. If I need to download anything, I connect to the WiFi at home, work or at almost any restaurant.I was able to activate the phone hassle-free (via the Verizon website). Others have reported issues such as being required to activate a data plan. I encountered no such problem.Connecting the phone via Bluetooth to my car radio (JVC) went flawlessly. Neither tears nor gnashing of teeth were experienced. People on the other side of the line haven't experienced any sound issues such as the echoing that used to occur with my smartphone.Going back to the earlier software on these phones, I've experienced a small learning curve. That is more than made up for by the ability to go several days without having to charge my phone. Also in this phones favor... No pesky, over-achieving spell-checker messing up my texts.",18,5
Samsung,"My husband absolutely loves this phone, he isn't exactly a phone whiz, but it is perfect for him, He likes the spec on it regarding the phone was built up to military specs, like dust proof, water resistant, not proof, shock resistant, built to handle a few drops, which he is notorious for at work. Can't believe Verizon let this go to the wayside, the battery is amazing, up to 3-4 days of not having to charge, amazing, hubby says. Anyway, hubby says well worth the price even if it is retired, he's pondering the idea of buying another one just in case this one gives up the ghost in the next couple of years. We liked the speedy shipping too. thank you.",11,5
Samsung,"This is a great flip phone for someone who needs a simple rugged phone to make phone calls (and the occasional text). It's really hard to find a decent phone that's not a ""smart"" phone for a Verizon network. Sound is good, no dropped calls, people on the other end hear what I'm saying. Does its job.",11,5
Samsung,"""No contract required"" is not specific enough. This is a prepay only phone until it has been used for six months, according to Verizon policy. Since I have an existing contract, I had to return mine.",11,1
Samsung,"I would have been very happy if I received what I ordered. Instead I received an old outdated model #U450 not the model U460 Intensity II which I ordered. To add injury to insult the phone they sent me was a month to month contract that I would have had to pay $50 a month for 6 months before I could transfer this phone to my existing 2 year contract I already had with Verizon! Nowhere in the add was this indicated, and in my opinion this was out and out FALSE advertising. The only positive thing I can say is that the guarantee through Amazon enabled me to get a full refund on my purchase price. Nothing can compensate me for the hours and days I spent trying to resolve this issue, and the tremendous frustration I still feel for having been put through this ordeal.What would I do differently? Well after this experience, I would suggest that Amazon etc, should hold their suppliers responsible for #1 providing the products they advertise, #2 require that they clearly disclose any hidden loopholes (like this 6 month minimum useage fee), and #3 have their suppliers state in writing that they will provide the products they advertise, or legally agree to pay the customer back at least 3 times the original purchase price, and give a written apology for the ""mistake"".Without some type of agreement or guarantee like this, I will find it very difficult to do business with Amazon, or anyone else online in the future.Sincerely, Ron S",48,2
Samsung,"Looking for a phone that I could activate on my current family plan without hassle from Verizon. Read carefully description and reviews. By the picture looked like a standard phone in regular box (not prepaid). Picture was not of a prepaid phone in it's package. From reading reviews on other phones that stated they were prepaid it's seems to be hit or miss if Verizon will let you activate immediately to a current plan. This phone did appear to be brand new and we actually received before expected. BUT, didn't want a prepaid! I feel the description and pic was misleading. I was able to return without hassle. Thanks Amazon, always easy to work with.",13,2
Samsung,"If you want a Pre-paid phone this is nice. I wish that it would of been stated in the description that it was a prepaid phone. I activated it and it will now sit for 6 months til I can move it over to my existing plan. Will have to see if I can get another cheap phone to replace the one that died for 6 months, Disappointed. Amazon, Please update the description to Pre-Paid phone... Thank you.",13,3
Sony,#N/A,11,3
Sony,"I decided to purchase the w995a after carefully researching some viable alternatives such as the Nokia n86 8mp, the still-good and underrated n96, and the n82. I chose the Sony because it looks and feels better than the other phones, not because it IS better than the others. Let me explain.This phone is absolutely gorgeous. Its made of brushed metal, it feels amazing in your hand, and the sliding mechanism is nearly perfect. It's a feature phone, so you really don't have any options to customize the UI like you would with a symbian phone (i.e. the nokias mentioned above), but if this doesn't bother you (which it did not bother me), it really won't matter because the menu layout is really perfect and intuitive. It has great sound, it's beautiful when lit up, and the call quality is superb. That being said, it's simply not a ""better"" phone than the nokias I've listed.For one, the camera is simply ""ok."" Shots taken indoors will disappoint you, while those taken outdoors look very good. The video recording is old-school at 30fps QVGA while the nokias mentioned record DVD quality video at 30fps in VGA. Not to mention the nokias have carl ziess optics (regarded as one of the best lense makers in the world).I decided not to go with the Nokia N86, it's ""closest"" competitor. The N86 is a better phone, it has an 8gb hard drive while the w995a comes with an 8gb card. The nokia can be expanded with up to a 16gb card, has a variable aperture 8mp that takes exquisite photos, and has the ever- customizable symbian UI. But its ugly, and plastic; typical Nokia.So, to sum it up:THE GOOD:-beautiful-well built-beautiful interface-good pictures-excellent media player-best sliding mech. everTHE BAD:-other phones in its price range are arguable better-should take great pictures, not good ones-video recording is 2004-era phone-has a TFT 256k screen, while all others in its price range have AMOLED 16M screens.It was a tough choice, but for me, the look and feel of this one took the cake!",33,4
Sony,"I got one of these just for $#!*$ & giggles, not too shabby!Sony xperia build quality impresses. The phone is not as largeas it looks on one of the original ads (girl must have had atiny hand lol ) the slide mechanism is a little slippery butsolid.As a game device, it's a bit underpowered, but this doesn'tseem to slow it down! Played all games i tried perfectly!Have yet to try it as a phone, wifi only so far.Gingerbread kinda stale by now but, NO ICS for the play.Sony cites instability issues that would compromise thePlay's core strength, GAMING.Custom roms around thought (rooted only, I did root only)The ergonomics of the phone are pretty good too.The slideout PS controller works great, even the ""Digilogs""?and the device as a whole doesn't feel to clunky in the hand.Only cons are the slippery slideout hinge and the overallGlossiness, which makes it a fingerprint magnet for usgreasballs...lol also wish the white was available toUSA carriers.Edit: UPDATEHaving had the phone for a bit longer I can say that in the openposition the phone is somewhat uncomfortable to hold for longperiods. I have average hands (large) slender and the slide outcontroller feels...to thin, and a bit smallish, leading to handfatigue fairly quick. The L & R shoulder buttons are difficult tomaintain your fingers at, while the touchpads feel to closetogether.Also the power/standby button is pathetically small, a smallsliver really. Sure you can use the menu buttons to wake thephone but eventually you need to use the power/standby buttonand it's tiny...But the phone really is a fun devise even just for gaming.Plus not being massive makes it a decent handset as well.",25,4
Sony,very good phone . wish it was a bit brighter . very good phone for gamer .would recommend .,13,5
Sony,"My only advice when looking for apps is to use a google search and use the term ""apk""makes tracking down the Emulators much easierLove this phone on my second one after an encounter ocean water fried the first one",13,5
Sony,"This is my first time using android, and i'm loving it. I'm not much of a tech girl so this phone works just perfect for me. I try to close the apps so it doesn't get slow, it's fast and really cute, I love the light that syncs with the apps and the different messages and pictures. I live in Venezuela and the phone came in Spanish, latin Spanish wich is a plus, i use it with Digitel and it works well.I recommend this phone with my eyes closed, it works really good comparing it with the low price",43,5

I have texted1100 messages and a handful of times it has frozen, but, easily ""re-booted""...and, frankly, it has only happened when signal strength was poor. It compares to wife's 3GS and 4. There isn't another phone under $175 with US warranty that is better and at $126, it is 5 stars.",37,5
Sony,"I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Y, which is not a bad phone but I kept running out of space on the actual phone. Even putting a 32gb sd card didn't help. It only has 128mb on the phone. Also the old phone had such a small screen that some things got cut off. Enough about my old phone. This new phone, this Sony phone, is great. Although does have some minor things that might get on my nerves. The main issue is that when you send texts and I automatically get a reply about message being relayed. Which was not an issue on the old phone but when doing a google on it. I found some black berries also having that issue with the same phone service that I have. it sounds like that is not something you can change at least nothing I can find says how to change that. I don't mind it being relayed I just don't want to be notified. Another issue is email notifications do not always work. I mean email works it just does not always seem to notify you. The gmail notifications do work. I did a google on that one as well and actually found some one talking about sony xperia but not this one, an older one. I am not sure which one he was talking about but he had this same issue and could not find a fix for it. He also suggested getting the Samsung Galaxy S3. I would get one of those but they are a lot more money then this phone.Any way I do like this phone even with the minor issues listed above. Oh wait I just remembered another issue that is not a major one either. This new phone does not work with my FM transmitter. I have no idea why either as it uses a standard head phone jack to connect to the phone. Any way again I do like the phone and I like that things are not cut off and I am not longer running out of room on the phone.Update to this review. I now give it 3 stars instead of 4. Main reason. Some times it will lock up and you have to remove the battery as none of the buttons work to get it to come back on correctly. It is a pain to remove the battery as well. Another issue is when the phone restarts either after pulling the battery or just restarting it. The phone comes back on and starts making random sounds. This is not my rington nor does it stop after a while. The first time it did this the thing made random sounds for almost an hour. I was on the other phone so could not pull my attention to trying to get it to stop instead I just covered it until I was off the other phone. I can stop it by swiping from the top to the bottom and hitting clear even if there is nothing to clear. This stops it. I have yet to figure out what causes this or why.",35,3

Sony,"I am not picky. I am not a big review writer. This is a warning.I bought this xperia to replace a low end samsung gravity whose screen i had cracked. This phone got decent reviews on androidandme.com and the price seemed right, esp for android 4+. Unfortunately:. This phone is painfully slow. Much slower than my old samsung which was android 2+. Imagine every time you press a button or swipe. Then wait many seconds. Sometimes 30 seconds. Then you are about to hit the back/escape button to start over when you see the operation has finally gone through. This happens many times a day. A simpler example: your phone rings, you swipe to answer, then you have to stare at the screen a few seconds to make sure the call has gone through.. I thought i would get a lot more functionality with the higher android but i havent.. The screen is dark and muddy. Even on the brightest setting it's hard to see.. It has a very clunky low end look and feel. Cost $150 looks $50.. Dont make the same mistake i did, thinking you just have to get used to the new phone. Its the phone not you. Now its too late for me to return phone.. Im on a budget. At the time i bought this junk the google nexus 4 was $300. Now its a great buy at $200. I wish i could have that instead. If youre on a stricter budget get a blu phone for about $80. People seem to like it. Skip this xperia pr you will regret it.",101,1
Sony,"Pros:- Dual Sim Capable- Responsive, doesn't feel slow and the UI looks nice- Phone design looks good, not ugly for a budget smart phone- microSD slot- Lightweight- Call quality (good even on International calls)Neutrals (features expected for a $150 smart phone):- Screen quality/resolution is average (320 x 480 pixels, 3.5 inches. 165 ppi pixel density)- Single core CPU (1 GHz Cortex-A5)- Memory is OK (4 GB, 2 GB user available. 512 MB RAM)- Battery Life is OK (not great but not bad either)Cons:- Dual Sims aren't very useful.- Only SIM1 is 3G capable, SIM2 is 2G only- Camera is useless, very poor quality pictures in most situations. Mediocre pictures in good light- Phone would lock-up if a call was made on one of the SIMs and it was ended before the other other party answered.- Random phone radio/dialer lock-ups (phone looks like it is working but no incoming or outgoing calls)- Random phone restarts- Phone doesn't shutdown after a lock-up, only fix is to remove the batteryThese problems were with NO 3rd party apps installed. Just what was on the phone itself.I regret buying this phone, it would have been better to just use 2 phones rather than this phone. It was bought so we could use it when traveling internationally. The Samsung dual SIM phones all supported 3G only on SIM1 (unlike Sony, Samsung was honest and stated this in their specifications). This phone just like the Samsung phones has one 3G radio which is for SIM1 only.In most countries 3G wouldn't matter for voice calls but if you travel to Japan or South Korea you need a 3G phone/radio, 2G doesn't work at all. Which is why I wanted a dual sim phone that supports 3G on both SIMs. I only found out of this problem while the phone was in Japan, SIM2 radio didn't work at all in Japan. This combined with the radio/dialer lock-up issue caused major problems.This phone was used by my mother (she knows how to use an Android phone just not troubleshoot it) and she had an awful experience with it. The phone lock-up and 3G radio issues left the phone inoperable for long periods during her trip. This made it impossible to communicate since we didn't know what was happening. The phone would work sometimes and not others. We tried several SIMs thinking it was a problem with the wireless service providers. What we didn't realize was that the phone worked for a little while because the battery was taken out and put back in during SIM swaps.This phone caused lots of stress for my mother & others trying to communicate with her during the trip and on her return. The day of her return she spent over two hours waiting at the airport after traveling for over 22 hours. Her flight was early, airport staff routed some passengers through a different terminal she thought we hadn't arrived yet and waited for us thinking we weren't at the airport yet. We arrived early as well because we saw that the flight was ahead of its schedule. We waited for her thinking customs/immigration might be taking time. We tried calling her but couldn't reach her since the phone was locked-up. She tried shutting down the phone (it never shutoff the phone was locked-up). She tried calling us but no calls went through, she thought the wireless service providers were the issue. Luckily she got tried of waiting and a couple of Good Samaritans helped her out, they called me for her so I was able to find her.Save yourself lots of headaches and stress, don't buy this phone.",13,1
Sony,I choose this rating after using the phone. I have two numbers from different service providers and this phone is ideal for that. I no longer have to carry around two phones. For the price of one phone I replaced two.Anyone who has two phones should replace them with this one. Android 4.1.1 is greeaatt also.,13,5
Sony,"For the price, it's a very complete phone. I really didn't expect it to be such a versatile and nice.And has all I need on it! Just loving it!",21,5
Sony,"This phone has good features but it restarts automatically quite often. I tried to factory reset and update the software, still notice that this problem still exists.",15,3
Sony,"For this price, it's a great value. It does almost all that my girlfriend's iPhone 4s does, and more. It is not as fast and responsive as the iPhone, the camera and the sound are also not as good, but it does the job. The screen size is identical to the iPhone, and the screen resolution seems to be the same. I installed a lot of apps on it, and so far have not run out of memory (unlike with my previous phone that had Android 2.3 on it). It came with Android 4.0, and recently was updated to 4.1. So far I have not found any use of the dual SIM card capability, but it could come handy on my next European trip if I buy a local SIM card there. That's the way to save on phone bills while overseas. Highly recommended.After a few months of use, I change my mind about this phone. Too slow. I hate it now. I bought a Nokia Lumia 635 instead. Much better.",15,2
Sony,"ITs soooo gorgeous , perfect , but the sim card is MICRO SIM , i love it. ( es hermoso lo recomiendo funciona en Vnezuela perfectamente solo que es sims MICRO hay que cortarlo)",14,5
Sony,This is an amazing phone for the price. It has the look performance & feel of a $500 phone for only $200. Probably the only concern is the small internal memory but you can put in a microsd & root it (both android & sony are open source so its completely easy) & then you can install apps on the memory to preserve the internal memory. I also liked that it came with almost no bloatware for me to remove. My only concern is its featherlight feels like nothing is in my hand(or pocket when not holding it) so I'll be sure to get a case for when I inevitably drop it.,18,5
Sony,"After buying a windows phone 8 device, I wanted to try how android is doing so I bought Xperia M.I love it's design, it resembles Xperia Z just a bit smaller though. It is light and easy to carry. Fits just right in my hand.What I hate about the device is it's hardware materials, the back cover feels fragile and cheap.Camera captures decent images in daylight and in low light situations.",17,5
Sony,"I had the option to buy the Z model from my current phone company but it was closer to $600. In comparison to that model, by going with this one I missed out on a few options but not major ones. It has a front-facing camera and does everything else I need it to without being bulky. The regular camera seems to be lower megapixels than I'm used to but the phone's photo editing options pretty much make up for it. I love the ease of customizing screens and notifications. I had to get a micro SIM card to fit in the phone so it delayed me using it until I could get to my phone company's store but the card was free so it wasn't a major setback. The Xperia app that downloads once you connect the phone to a computer allows for a lot of options, including transferring contacts from your old phone so I did not lose anything. The battery life is a little shorter than I would prefer but there are battery-saving options that are pretty effective. I would definitely recommend this phone as a cheaper alternative to upgrading through a phone company!",16,4
Sony,"I started using ios a few years ago. After a few years, I got bored of it. So I sold my iPhone and got this (it was on sale for$200). I got it 2 moths back (November 7). First thing, this is an honest review; I am not being paid to review this product.Build quality/ hardware- the phone is 7.3 mm. It's pretty slim and feels sturdy in your hand. The power and volume buttons are weirdly placed at the right middle side of the phone. In my case, this proves to be a good thing because I have small-medium hands. There is one front facing speaker, SD card slot on the left, charging port on the left, micro simcard on the right, a headphone jack on the top, and a camera button on the bottom right( to take photos instead of touching the screen) . The back of the phone is plastic but looks like glass. The back and front of the phone are very vulnerable to scratches; I recommend buying a screen protector and cover. There are no physical home buttons. The phone is water proof, but you should wipe your screen after putting it in water as it tends to become unresponsive when you touch the screen.Software- the phone is pre-installed with Android 5.0 and loaded with about 23 apps of which only around 7 are useful. After deleting apps and cache I had 12 gb left. The skin is very close to stock lollipop android. So far no apps have crashed. Something I found nice is the ability to record your screen when you long press the power button.Camera- I'm not a selfie guy, but alot of people take photos of their duck lips and food so I included this part. The camera is pretty good, but not the best. There are lots of settings to enhance your photo experience. Something I found fun was that is has a virtual reality camera mode that allows you to talk photos/videos of dinosaurs, undersea,etc. A very big setback is its lack of flash. So if you live in a dark cave, too bad. You can zoom in too, but it gets blurry and hard to adjust. Something I found useful is that the camera recognises where you are, so if your driving and taking a video it makes the videos look not blurry.Performance- Im a gamer, and performance is key in every product I purchase for gaming. The phone has 2 gigs of ram and a snapdragon 615. It tends to heat but not as much as lava on your hand. The heating problem is not a big deal. I have 21 games on my phone( no SD card) of which include modern combat 4, Nova, asphalt 8, minecraft, and terraria. These games played pretty well with occasional lag, although it's almost unnoticeable. The phone scored 25841on antutu, single core 527 on geekbench 3, and multicore 1905 on geekbench 3. Decent enough.Conclusion: overall I am very pleased and satisfied with the experia m4 aqua. It has a low price but simply beats others of its price range due to ram,waterproof, snapdragon 615, and good slim build. I would recommend this phone to anyone.",75,5
Sony,"For the sub-$300 price, this device sounds great on paper. It turns out it's MOSTLY okay. Mine is currently about to be sent back to Sony, but more on that in a moment.The design mirrors the xperia z3 for the most part, but that's a matter of taste really so I won't say much except to note that the glass back panel on the z3 has been replaced by a very scratchable PLASTIC panel on the m4 aqua. That's ok at this price range. One major downside of this device that actually also affects the flagship z3 (and z5!) is the screen-to-body ratio. The top and bottom bezels on this device are LARGE. This is a phone with a 5"" screen, but it's about a large and unwieldy as my LG G3, which has a 5.5"" screen. It's also quite slick, due to the rounded edges. Nice looking, but not really ergonomic.Yes, this device has a 720p screen. That doesn't bother me, but be aware if that is a problem for you. Performance, on the other hand, is surprisingly ...MEH. The Snapdragon 615, while definitely a mid-range CPU, should really make this thing at least ""feel"" snappy with regard to the interface. However, I really find the whole experience often quite laggy, with poor multitasking, despite the accompanying 2 GB of RAM. Again, at this price point, not a dealbreaker. However, there are many devices on the market using the same processor, and even lower end Snapdragons such as in the 2015 Moto G, which still manage to have very snappy interfaces at the same or lower price.Camera performance is very disappointing. In extremely bright outdoor lighting, you can definitely capture some great STILL shots. Indoors, or with moving subjects, do expect much less than stellar image quality. Furthermore, the camera is unacceptably SLOW. After shooting, expect several seconds to pass before you can take another shot. There's really no excuse for this. Using a third-party camera such as Google Camera or Camera FV-5 are lightyears ahead in speed. I'm extremely confused that Sony considered this performance acceptable, even on a midrange device.NOW, onto my return to Sony. I've had this phone for only a month. Yesterday, the earpiece simply stopped working when making or receiving calls. The speakerphone is still functional, but that's hardly something I could live with, considering the fact I've only had this device for a few weeks. I did my best to troubleshoot, to no avail. Then factory reset the phone. When that didn't work, I tried to chat with an Xperia Care agent who suggested I try some diagnostics in the service menu. No dice. He then insisted that I completely reinstall the system software using Sony's PC Companion software and get back to them if that didn't work. Well, surprise of the year, it didn't solve anything. After chatting with a second Xperia Care rep, I was told I had to CALL for an actual RMA. So, call I did. To my disappointment, I was not even provided a return shipping label with my RMA number. I was furthermore warned several times that if there was any sign of water damage that my warranty would not be honored. Now, there is certainly NOT any water damage to my device. However, for a phone highly touted as waterproof (or at least highly water-resistant), that's just a major turn-off.We'll see how the RMA goes, I guess. I really only bought this device to tide me over while I waited for a Z5, but it served as a pretty good audition! I've decided I definitely do not want another Xperia! At less than half the price of a Z5! I'm always trying to find the bright side, ya know.Sigh...Don't buy this phone. Or do! It's quite inexpensive, at least.",11,3
Sony,Only had the phone a day so keep that in mind when reading this review....My last phone was the Nexus 4. I had it just under 3 years. Great phone. Its lack of LTE bands and limited space (16GB with no SD card) was a problem. Other than that I'd still have the phone. I have no interest in paying the premium for a flagship phone as midrange phones are plenty for my needs. I tried a couple different refurbished phones but each on had problems...I assume because they were used/refurbished. So I knew I had to go with a new phone. I did get the invite for the OnePlus X but canceled my order when I decided that it lack too many LTE bands to be as useful as it could be in the US (really band 4 was the only option). I was thinking about getting a Z3 but even used ones were still way too expensive IMO. So I saw this one.I knew when I ordered it that it was not a flagship phone. It has a 13megapixal camera which is not flagship quality but...its not a flagship. The battery is only 2400+ which is low compared to flagship but...its not a flagship phone. CPU...not flagship quality but... you know.Its not a flagship phone but it is also 1/3 the price of a flagship phone. It offers all the gsm LTE bands you could want (for the US). Its thin. The battery isn't 2 days as Sony says but in the 1 day I've had it I've been impressed (Nexus 4 was smaller battery so this better). Camera is only 13megapixal but its better than the 8megapixal I was use to. Its practically stock android (something I am use to).On a personal note: I like the design of the phone. I never liked the rounded back you get on many phones now a days. I like when my lays on a table that it doesn't rock when you click on the screen. I like the relatively squared corners of the M4. It gives the illusion of a good phone to screen size ratio. I completely understand others might not share these opinions. Its just my preference.For the money its a good phone. For now I'll give it 5 stars as my limited experience has been nothing but great.While I appreciate what flagship phones give you (my Nexus 4 was a flagship phone in its time) and I could afford it if I wanted but what you get for the cost just doesn't out weigh a number of mid-range phones priced in the $~200 range.Edit #1 (1 week):Absolutely no complaints. Its a beautiful phone..especially in its price range. The battery has been absolutely fantastic for my use. I am confident I could get almost 2 days on my normal use. My more significant use (when my son gets his hands on it) does drain the battery faster but I can still get over a day with it. This is the first phone I've had where I know I do not have to plug it in during the day and can probably skip charging every night.Edit #2 (2 months):Fantastic phone. For the money I am shocked how good it is. It is only running Lollipop but I can only assume that the Sony customization to the OS has added something to improve battery life (like what Marshmallow gives you today). When I am at work I probably listen to music (from the SD card) for about 4-5 hours a day. Add in a little internet usage throughout the day and I still have ~60% battery life by the end of the day. As I said before when pushed the phone can drain quickly (son playing lots of games or watching YouTube videos) but for my normal usage this is quite nice for me. My Nexus 4 would not make to the end of my work day without needing to be plugged in if I did the same thing (music and some internet browsing).The camera is? Well the camera itself is quite nice. But the Sony camera software isn't quite right. Its slow. The Android camera app is a definite improvement. So I am not going to change my 5 star review for a slow camera app (that would be silly).I did find one problem though: I had paired my phone with my car (Honda Fit). Everything was working fine for days/weeks. Then one day I realized the car was not informing me of text messages from my phone. Seems the phone had some sort of issue with bluetooth and its saved pairing with the car seemed broken. I had to delete the pairing my phone and car had and recreate the pairing. Its been fine since then. Not sure what happened or what caused the issue but all seems fine now. I suppose if I could do 4.5 stars I'd consider lowering my review but since I cannot I am sticking with 5 as I think it is better that 4 stars. Plus....its possible my car was the problem and not the phone (but I did not have this problem with my previous phone).Anyways....love the phone.,11,5
Sony,"This is a sweet phone. They make the phone look really classy like Sonys higher end models. The insides are quality components that should perform better, but comparison tests show that it is a bit slower than similar hardware. Attribute that to the 'pretty'sony software/theme. Testers go out of their way to really torture this phone on youtube (see xperia m4 aqua nutella, knife, waterproof) and this ip68 rated phone does really well. I love this phone and am considering their tablet now. Water And dust proof, beautiful design, memory slot. What more to ask for? Laugh at those fools that spend nearly a grand on these 'smart phones', and then end up getting it wet or shattering it. No nense in spending that especially when you will replace them in a year or two. Thats just being a dumb user and giving money away to the company so the can build a spaceship campus. Battery life is impressive: with everything on (broadband data, wifi, bluetooth) and normal use (texting, phone, some surfing) it can go 3.5 to 4 days between full charge. The full charging itself is very fast, i say under 2hrs. This is all without Sonys battery saving modes! I'm testing the two battery saving modes now. Incredible phone, and looks very nice. Buy this phone for 2-3 hundred, spend another 15 on nice rubber case and glass screen protector. This phone looks and feels amazing in its protection, not clumsy and goofy like those samsungs and apples. Yes, get this phone and you will have a smart phone with a smart user, instead of blowing a grand on some ARM PoS that can barely compute.",42,5
Sony,"The phone itself is not bad, but the customer service from Sony is awful. After a few months of using the phone, the ear piece in the phone stopped working, I called sony and explained the problem, it still worked on speaker, and with the handsfree set in, but not when holding the earpiece to my ear. They insisted it could be a software glitch and had me reset the phone..... twice, which did not work.So I had to send it in for repair, and this is where the fun starts. Having been told it would take about 14 business days to fix and send my phone back, I am currently still waiting and we are on business day 28. To this point, after 4 phone calls, and 3 emails (because one representative actually told me that they didn't have a way to call people at the facility where the repairs take place, true story!), still no-one can tell me when the phone might be fixed.With that in mind, I asked for a replacement phone the last time I contacted them, I felt that was not unreasonable as they were well past their own schedule for repairing and returning my device, and clearly could not give any clue as to when it might be done. They simply ignored that request and said that my phone would be repaired and sent back when they got the parts in. This could be in 6 days, or 6 months.I would not by this product and would recommend people avoid sony products if this is what happens when the slightest thing goes wrong. The support (or lack thereof) is appalling for a company of their size and standing, and it could be a simple fix, if they would just replace a device when they are having so much trouble finding the part they need for it. Instead they are leaving a paying customer hanging, with no recourse, and without the phone paid for.",27,1

Sony,I really loved this phone until it started shutting down even with having 85% charge. I have to place on charger in order for it to turn back on. I've owned the phone for less than a month.,11,3
Sony,"Well, as a long time die hard Nokia fan (Currently own a Nokia N8)I was looking for a pone that would me to experience Android but did not want an expensive (flagship) pone but neither wanted a Low end one. This pone fits that description. I have used a Galaxy Ace and found it lacking some stuff I really wanted (Front facing camera, decent rear camera and onboard storage)and I realized then that I don't like TouchWiz UI so Samsung is out of the question.This pone feels very good in the hand, has the right size as most pones nowadays are over 4 inches in size, and to me that's just too big (even though I have big hands)The downside for me is that the accessories are way too expensive for this pone and it does not came with a screen protector or a headset.I am still stumbling on some of it's features and on Android as a whole, as I am just learning the howto's of Android.I am still looking for a substitute to my two years old N8, but untill I can find a pone with the same or better battery life (3 days with wifi on 24 hours) and a better camera, and a matching signal coverage and call quality, the N8 is staying with me.Overall I am lovind thei pone so far, it just scared me a bit one time when, after playing with the settings, the screen would not turn on when the charger was unplugged, I could hear the pone unlocking click but could not see nothing on the screen. After re-connecting the charger, the screen came back on, so I increased the screen brightness a bit and the issue went away (same thing happenned to me once with an Asus netbook).Nice Little pone, really recommended for anyone who does not want a high end android but a good mid range one. Ohh, and it comes with ICS out of the box (unlike the Galaxy Ace, and I do't think it will ever be updated to ICS)***UPDATE Jan 16 2013***Minus 2 starts as the phone is now going to a repair shop.It has developped a really annoying ""feature"" where if the phone is charged using the supplied charger, it would get hot and after the screen turns off it will not come back on after the charge is completed. The phone will continue to work, as I will hear it unlock, receive calls and notifications also but I can't see a thing as the screen is completely black.It would normally ""wake up"" randomly after a couple minutes or hours and continue to work fine untill the next charge.I then avoided charging it with the supplied charger and used the computer instead as when I did so, it would not get hot and all will work fine after the charge is completed.Well, 3 days ago I charged the phone with the computer and the screen turned off, as it normally does, after the charge was completed it worked fine so I went outside. When I tried to use the phone the screen would not come back on. I can hear the phone doing the ""click"" when I unlock it, I can receive calls, but the screen is completely black.3 days now and the screen is still pitch black so the phone is going to a repair shop so they can determine what is the problem with it.As I am no longer in the US I cannot return it as the fee is very high to ship a package to the US and back, so it's going to have to go to a local repair shop.I was so happy with the phone untill this.I must have got a lemmon.",12,3
Sony,"Intro: Having passed through a few reasonably priced, decently powered Xperia handsets (my last was a Xperia Mini) I am now on to my latest, the Sony Xperia Miro ST23a. This purchase was influenced by a couple of factors such as the availability of handsets at the time, the features (I missed the front camera in my old Xperia Mini Pro) and a simple design. I tend to stick to mid-range Android handsets because technology changes everyday and it makes no sense buying expensive, high end devices when the next best thing is right around the corner. However, this is subject to debate because we'll agree that everyone has different needs and tastes where mobile handsets are concerned.Features: I'll just highlight a few of the main features below since the full specifications can be found by searching for the Sony Xperia Miro at cc[...]:- Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich Operating System (latest handset build is 11.0.A.5.5 which seems to speed up functionality and add the SMS counter)- Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support as well as dual-band UMTS support- 3.5"" 320 x 480 pixel touch-screen with HVGA resolution- 800MHz Cortex-A5 Processor- 5MP rear camera with auto-focus and LED flash- VGA front camera for Googletalk, Oovoo and Skype calls- MicroSD card slot (internal) with support for up to a 32GB card- 4GB internal memory and 512MB RAM- Wi-Fi b/g/n, Wi-Fi hot-spot support- Stereo FM radio and much moreOpinion: The Sony Xperia Miro satisfies my needs for a smartphone at the moment, however I haven't fully explored its capabilities or features as yet. The camera quality is crisp and clear when taking pictures and the interface is far smoother than the update I performed on my previous Xperia Mini Pro and Xperia Mini handsets. It is a reasonably priced handset (I got mines at the time for US$202.26) which provides the standard features you'll come to expect from a Sony Xperia handset. I did not receive a headset with my purchase but I was able to source one via Amazon. For others who may need to purchase a headset, please be advised that you cannot use previous Sony Ericsson headsets with the newer Sony Xperia handsets. According to a post by another user (see the customer review here[...] ) older Sony Ericsson Xperia headsets use the OMTP standard which is not compatible with newer Sony Xperia handsets.",25,5
Sony,"My original T-Mobile phone was supposed to be everything that this phone was, only it wasn't. For the same price I got an Android 2.3 Gingerbread with an Amoled touch screen, though it was pretty to look at the phone could not update and it caused me major grief when the SD card slot died and the phone slowed down after only a couple months of owning it. Instead of buying out of contract and adding more pain to my wallet I looked to Amazon, I had heard that Sony was starting to make amazing smartphones and found that an Android 4.0 ICS was available - I read many reviews against this and other Xperia types; there are more expensive ones out there that only run 2.3 - I wondered how and why this was, as this phone is a good deal $200.00 less than those. After thinking really hard, I bought it - two days later I was able to play with it, though the screen is not an Amoled and doesn't look the greatest - I got used to it in a matter of hours, this phone is seriously fast when you want an app open it doesn't fumble the screen around flickering trying to operate - it just opens quickly and smoothly. It has built in Walkman technology only the best of what you would imagine from Sony with level adjustments and equalizers built in with no added app or cost to get it, unlike my old phone where I had to buy a $2.00 app to get the same basic functionality. The downside is Sony's Timescape which has not had an update in months so getting the live Social Media Updates right from the homescreen gives an error, from the looks of it, even the new Sony Xperia series still have this problem and Sony may never fix it, but I took it off the homescreen and that took care of that. It has a changing color theme light which is very cool and changes from blue for facebook or text message updates or red if you get google updates and it looks extremely sleek and futuristic which is everything I have wanted in a phone. It's the greatest purchase I have have ever made for myself on such a small device.The camera is a true 5.0mp camera and takes very clean photos and it takes them quickly, the video is a bit different - the quality is brought down quite a bit. The microphone on this is the clearest I've heard on a mid level phone as well as the speaker on the back - Sony knows sound and they do it really well.The phone is very lightweight, to the point that I thought that there was nothing inside of it at first.After using it for a couple weeks it's showing me there is something in there and it's doing a fantastic job.Sony used to leave a very bitter taste in my mouth - from TV's catching on fire, to sparking Vaio batteries... I used to be an Apple only kind of person, but my family introduced me to Android and Google - which I thought was best with Samsung, I no longer feel that way. I feel Sony has started to become an electronics giant again and I am excited to see what they will bring in the future.",13,5
Sony,"I'm a person who wants a few things from a phone.1. Does the basics well (call, receive, messaging)2. The equipment is quality (display, camera, speaker, gps, browser)3. Relatively modern without the expensive price. (I could care less about the latest edge in smartphones, anything that is outdated before its warranty ends should not be a heavy investment.)This phone fulfilled these challenges rather nicely.Description:This phone has a 4"" display, finished with a rounded aluminum backing in matte black. The bar that contains the android's back, home, and menu keys is transparent. The top of the phone has the 3.5mm jack. The bottom piece is a removable plastic cap. Removing it will expose a label that shows the serial/manufacturer info. The speakerphone is on the right side of the phone, below that is the power/unlock screen button, below that button is the volume adjustment, and ends with a 2-stage dedicated camera button. There is a front facing camera for skype and a rear facing 8mp camera (6mp when used in 16:9 widescreen) equipped with a bright LED flash. On the left side of the phone there is the micro-usb charging port, the micro hdmi ouput, the slot for microsim. The micro usb and hdmi ports are uncovered whereas the microsim port is covered. Comes with in-ear headphones w/ microphone as linked here?ÿSony MH750 Stereo Headset with Microphone and Answer/End Button for Cell Phones - Black (Bulk Packaging)?ÿFactory unlocked with 1 year manufacturer warranty.The good:-Screen quality and brightness. Big and bright with 960x540 resolution. The indoor/outdoor visibility of the screen is just phenomenal. All the displayed text is legible and all the colors are only minimally washed out even in the southern California sunlight. At times, I use this phone in the dark and the backlight adjustment is just perfect. My eyes aren't strained at all when I do my 10-20 minute web browsing/Angry Birds session before I sleep. The screen is bright enough to be used outdoors and sensitive enough to be used indoors. As an added touch it comes with a screen protector applied by the factory.-The camera. It is quick to focus, flash, and take a picture. The camera key can be used to activate the camera when the phone is in sleep (have to really press down on it for .5s), and it can be set to whether the phone will take a picture directly or just focused. This camera wake-up option (called Quick Launch by Sony) can be disabled altogether.-Speaker phone quality. It's not tinny and sharp and its loud enough.-Cellphone reception. It's been good for me even on T-mobile even without 3G and the other bands as seen in the chart Amazon as provided. WiFi strength is reasonably strong.-Texting. 3 choices in keyboard layout, traditional T9 and 2 versions of QWERTY. There is a gesture function (dragging your finger across the letters of a word will automatically type the word), texting too quickly will activate this function so I turned it off. Auto-correct can be fully tamed. The voice-to-text works really well for me, I tried the tongue twister ""She sells sea shells by the sea shore"" and it worked for the most part. The only mistake that it made was instead of sea it inputted see. There are options of different language keyboards as well, English, Chinese, and Japanese.-Optimization of Android OS by Sony. Very quick to jump from menu to menu, app to app. Applies updates independently with just a WiFi source. Facebook integration works, Skype works depending on bandwith strength.-Overall quality and feel. Thin and well weighted. The touchscreen is very responsive asides from the trouble I have swiping across screens with 1 hand. The transparent bar's keys are very responsive. It is incredibly distinct with its design, unlike those other just rectangular bars with a big screen.-No software required to connect the Xperia P to a PC. It opens up the ~12gb of usable space like a flash drive, transfers files drag and drop style. There's an optional Xperia companion software, but I prefer the simplicity of dragging and dropping files.-Language options. The Xperia P comes loaded with 50+ languages including multiple dialects of English, Spanish, and Chinese. As a cruel joke someone can set the language to Basa Sunda, Galego, Shqipe, or Srpski.-The included in-ear headphones aren't the best but it's better than the cheap earbuds normally packaged with phones. The headphone's wire lacks a slider because it's the behind the neck style wire where the left bud's wire is 1/2 to 1/3 the length of the right bud.The bad:-Subpar battery life unless all battery saving apps are on. Leaving WiFi connected alone drained the battery in half over night. Turning on extended battery saving mode and energy saver mode on the display will double the battery life to about 2 days of moderate usage. I've managed to average 25% of battery usage daily by just sending/receiving texts with minimal WiFi usage.-Non-removable backplate and battery. Battery life estimations are exaggerated to say the least.-Battery gauge was finicky at first. I charged it at 20% and the battery gauge would stay at 20% even though I charged it for a full night. Restarting the phone would show 100%. This glitch is now gone after a week of usage.-No SD card expansion.-Auto-rotate isn't sensitive enough, I have to swing the phone around a bit if I'm laying down and texting.-Camera key is a little stiff. Focusing with the camera is easy, taking a snapshot takes quite a bit more effort.Update: 12/08/12-Be mindful of the proximity sensor on the phone or you'll end up hanging on whoever you're talking to. When your face is close enough to the phone, the screen will automatically lock however I'm used to using my shoulder to hold the phone against my face. The phone will go out of place and I'll end up hitting the End Call button really easily. Sony, if you're reading this, make the range on the proximity sensor go farther on future phones.-Restart the phone every couple of days because the apps will drain the phone's battery life even after closing them. I've forgotten to restart my phone after a busy week and I find the battery life being drained down to 65% overnight.-After a few months of usage, the phone isn't showing any signs of slowing down. I still love using this phone.Update: 4/26/13-Sony has finally delivered a 4.1 Jelly Bean update to the Xperia P. However this may have caused my phone to brick itself momentarily. One day, the OS just stopped being responsive so I restarted the phone, only to have to fail to initialize and get to the homepage. So I used sony's update software to hopefully just patch and update from ICS to Jellybean. This didn't work either so I had to reformat. I consequently lost all my contacts and apps installed but still kept everything in the storage part of the phone (music, photos, etc). Since this problem was an easy fix and accidents do happen I still recommend this phone. I am not sure if this is Android's fault or Sony's fault and if this proves to be persistent than I will assume it's Sony's fault and will update this review.-On the plus side, 4.1 Jelly Bean adds Google Now and has updated the overall look of the phone ie screen lock, icons, menu layout, color themes etc. There is now a 'Stamina Mode' which replaced 'Extended Battery Mode' to increase battery life, it now provides an estimate of the stand-by time remaining. Sony Walkman has also been updated to have an equalizer and xClarity which is an automatic equalizer.",84,5

Sony,"As for as I'm concerned,the mobile phone is1. Very good with great package of technology (1 ghz dual core,1gb RAM, good graphics gpu,NFC,White magic technology, etc )2. Very light in weight,3. Awesome display resolution,4. Best video quality, and5. Mind-blowing white magic technology.6. Walkman with In-ear headphone is top of all.7. 8 mp camera with 1080 p video recording is on its best.but I ve found some cons in this phone.1. Even though the RAM capacity is 1 GB, the mobile phone lags a bit in ICS 4.0.2. The Automatic screen rotation has some bugs. When I rotate the screen during the main screen (desktop screen) it goes weird, full black display with battery info,time, notifications at the top row. and also the screen flickers. (had reset it twice but still experiencing this issue)3. dedicated loud-speaker is not that good to hear songs. and also it pointed towards the right side so 1 sided audio doesn't impressed me enough.4. Inbuilt-Battery is the worst idea.. it's not at all lasts for a day. some time If u browse for 3 hours the battery will ve gone to 0%.5. No sd card slot. sony should have considered this.And about the package, I didn't receive the HDMI-media cable. It clearly mentioned that the box has HDMI cable. but I found only an empty space inside the box at the space for HDMI media cable. I have to make a compliant regarding this.",10,5

Sony,"This is by no means a perfect phone but this is really the best you can get for a small android phone. Almost all the phone manufacturers have dismissed making a small phone in favor of their 5+ inch slabs. I started using androids with a Moto X 2013, which to me was the perfect 4.7 inch phone if you disregard the crappy camera that it had. Unfortunately, Motorola decided bigger is better with their later models, and now the their Chinese overlords that currently own them have pretty much stated that they have no plans of making a small phone again. In fact, they have gone full retard with them making their current phones even bigger and wider.After the Moto X started slowing down after a few drops and age, I ""upgraded"" to the new Moto G 2015, which was not too bad in terms of screen height at 5 inches, but the width of this tubby made it hard to handle with one hand. Not to mention that is was a downgrade from the beautiful AMOLED screen from the Moto X. My camera and LED light crapped out after I dropped my Moto G so I got the Xperia X Compact after some research.Now the nice things about this phone:- Screen: I'm not much of a high res snob but 720p works for this size and it looks much better than my Moto G which had that resolution for 5 inches. Just wish this was an AMOLED for those nice dark blacks.- Memory: I've felt no slowdowns as far as RAM when multitasking. For regular storage you have 32GB which is enough for most people but you can also expand it 256 GB more with a micro SD.- Camera: Best camera that I've had which is not saying much given what my previous phones are. Other people would probably be more credible than me since I never but too much importance on this function but these pictures do look sweet.- Speed: Feels a hell of a lot snappier than my previous phone which is really no surprise with the superior processor. Apparently, the lower resolution gives it a faster speed than say a 1080p would.- Button placement: Yes, I actually like where the sound buttons are placed. I use my phones left handed (even though I'm right handed) and the button placement for volume is actually not awkward as it would be for a right handed user. This doubles as a convenient zoom in and out button for the camera.- Double front facing speakers: A rarity these days, especially for this phone size. Very high quality audio too.-Battery life: About 40-60% at the end of a day which is pretty good for me but this will depend on the person and what apps they are using.Not so great things:- Exterior design: Could have used a more matte, less slippery design. Shows fingerprints. All this can be fixed with a skin but this should not have been necessary. Ergonomics are inferior to the curved Motorola and Samsung designs for handling, while this did improve from the previous blocky Sony phones by curving the sides, they could have done better.Price: This isn't too bad now that Sony has put down the crack pipe and lowered the price from their initial 500 dollar tag.Neutral things:- Lack of fingerprint scanner: This can actually be enabled by reflashing to the UK version which is what I did. Does appear to show less bars on reception as mentioned by a previous reviewer but the connection seems to work just fine. Would not recommend doing this for everyone but do it at your own risk or just buy the international version.-No waterproofing: More accurately, this is not warrantied as being waterproof. YouTube videos have shown that this is actually pretty water resistant and that Sony most likely just doesn't want to cover claims.Say what you will about Sony, while they are deserving of much criticism for their reported crappy customer service and overpricing of their phones, they are the only ones in the android market that are meeting a neglected segment by making a decent phone that is easy to handle one handed, that has a near stock android feel, and actually has the back and recent keys on the correct sides (looking at you Samsung).Note: Still in early ownership and will update if there are any snags.",11,4
Sony,If you are looking for a mid sized phone you can use with one hand in October of 2016 this phone is your best option.Pros:- Phone fits in one hand- Battery life lasts all day and in some cases two days- Phone works great on T-mobile's network while also having band 12 for faster LTE (Works well on AT&T too)- UI is smooth and doesn't lag with a minimalist skin over stock android- No overheating issues like z5 compact- Android 7.0 N due to release in November- USB C with quick charge 3.0- Expandable memory- Front facing speakersCons- Plastic doesn't feel as premium like the s7 and iphone 7- Fairly thick for a phone made in 2016- Camera is adequate but has trouble in low light and tends to overexpose in daylight- No amoled display- Volume buttons are too low although they function well when using the camera- No fingerprint sensor with US version- No waterproofing- Black is more of a dark blueIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with so many phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices but all in all I think this is a good phone that you won't regret buying if you are wanting a moderately sized phone,37,4
Sony,"Starting off, I'm coming from a Nexus 5 (2013) and I primarily got this phone because the Nexus was getting a bit long in the tooth, so this is a big jump for me in terms of phones and I think it's great overall. I chose the X Compact (over, let's say, the new Moto phones or the Pixel phones about to come out) primarily due to its smaller size as well as its design (though the X Compact was definitely in the upper limit of what I was willing to pay for a new phone); I rather enjoy the simple, clean design of it with the curves along the long edges. Looking at just the specs, it does seem overpriced (I got this at a pretty nice deal, though), but I ultimately enjoy the purchase.My pros and cons are coming from a user that doesn't play games, nor watch too many videos or listen to music too much. I just use it for chatting with friends and communicating with co workers (e.g. text, e-mail, etc), and browsing everyone's favorite news aggregator. Sprinkle in some photo taking, reading the news, and that's pretty much all I use my smartphone for, so my expectations are set accordingly.Pros:+ Clean, simple design with a nice color+ Nice pocketable size+ 720p screen looks great+ Speedy performance for what I need/want+ Dual front facing speakers+ Camera seems nice (I haven't tested it too rigorously yet, however)+ Good battery life (easily lasts me a day with 40% left, but again, I'm not a heavy user)+ Fast charging, and USB C is nice (though I guess I have to get an adapter for all my micro USB chargers)+ Great, lightly skinned Android with 7.0 Nougat updates confirmed (albeit sometime in November, I think?)I can't think of too many cons since I'm not exactly the pickiest, and I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this phone.Cons:- Bit expensive for the hardware you get compared to other phones- Some bloatware that can't be uninstalled, but you can hide them from your apps drawer- Speakers aren't the loudest- Not too many accessories out yet (e.g. cases, screen protectors)Again, I really like this phone, but if you're looking for a phone with top of the line specs or something of comparable specs to this one at a lower price point, you may want to look elsewhere (e.g. OnePlus 3, Moto G4 family, Nexus 5X/6P, etc). I'll try to update this in a month or two, however, when I can probably be a bit more discerning. Hope this helps!",34,5
Sony,"Having tried almost every recent Sony Xperia phone in the past 3 years or so, this is by far one of the best since the Xperia Z3 Compact. It's faster than the Z5 series (Antutu and everyday usage). Snappy, no lag, camera is soon much quicker and better photos. And unless you really want the water proofing or care for benchmarks, no reason to get the thicker and bulkier X Performance variant. I don't do games on the phone so the processor is more than enough and feels just as fast as any other phone in daily usage.The screen and design puts it on the same level as other flagships. Curved and flush with the bezels, smooth and feels premium. I have an iPhone 6S as well and I finally feel the Sony has that same polished and feel when you hold it in your hand. Price could be a little cheaper but Sony is always a little pricier than others. Size is a perfect balance I think between bulky 5.5+ phones and smaller 4.x phones.",14,5
Sony,"I have tested two separate units and the results are the same: There appears to be an LTE issue with AT&T. It just drops completely, then comes back, then drops again constantly. It does not fall back to HSPA. If you change the network mode to HSPA, it will stay connected, but if you have the Network Mode set to anything with LTE, it will drop all connectivity periodically. All APNs were correct and I even tried some older ones. I have 5 other Android phones and all of them maintain connectivity fine with the same SIM card.As a result, I didn't get to properly test the device. I processed a return on the first device and then just immediately tested the connectivity on the second device. Confirming that the issue was the same, I returned that one as well. Sony could probably fix this with a software update, if you're on AT&T, this is a no go unless you're willing to live with HSPA and change some settings.",10,1
Sony,"I'm a cell phone addict, I have played with a number of devices ranging from the Oneplus 2, Galaxy S7, and Nexus 6P over the past year. I have to say for 298 with the 64gb sd card, this was a steal. The build quality of the device is fantastic, it has NFC, and a 1080P display. The battery while not large seems to work just fine, and Stamina mode can help extend the life even further.I'm averaging about 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time which for a 2700 mah battery, 6"" display, and octacore processor is fantastic. Signal seems to be strong, and reliable, call quality is good and bluetooth works great. The cameras are solid as well I've been snapping pics of my dog. Performance is solid, while it is in fact a Mediatek P10 processor it is more than capable of handling day to day tasks and basic gaming. The screen is responsive, and clear, with good viewing angles, and is an AMOLED panel.The build quality of the phone is top notch, it feels great and balanced in your hand, and while extremely large is a smaller footprint than an iPhone 6s Plus or original Nexus 6 thanks to the bezeless sides.Only thing I wish this had is a fingerprint reader, and a tap to wake feature so I didn't always need to use the power button. Other than that I love my new device!",43,5
Sony,"I bought this phone the first day it came out, because I really wanted to have a big screen and my lg g5 only have a 5.3 screen, I am currently using it with cricket wireless and I get signal almost everywhere.pros:-screen alone is 5 stars, is amazing, good quality, good brightness even outside, great whites, love the edgeless design, I'm glad sony still uses lcd panels because amoled screens are prone to burn in.-phone is fast, I haven't experience any slowness or lag, everything opens really fast.-speaker sound is really nice and loud another 5 stars for it.-battery life is the same or better than my lg g5, so I cant really complain here.-call quality is good, signal is good as wellcons:-only 16gb of internal memory, this is my main concern this phone deserves a least 32gb of internal memory, I downloaded a couple games and I only have 1 gb left. unfortunately you cant install apps directly to sd card. You can move some apps to sd card only if the developer allowed it, so some apps wont let you move them to the sd card. so this is a big downside.-hard to find quality cases and screen protectors-miss tap to wake a lot, I think this is one of the reasons I miss my lg g5-miss fast charging, this is the other reason I miss my lg g5 lol.anyways this is a great phone I have no regrets on buying this phone even though I paid full price for it, the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because this phone deserved more internal storage and a bigger battery.UPDATE 1:after a flawless one week use, this last week the phone started experiencing problems. for some reason as others have said before, the cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. I noticed this only happened when enabling LTE mode on crickets (ATT's network) so unless Sony fixes this before my return period, ill keep it otherwise i will return phone. otherwise this is a fantastic device.UPDATE 2:SONY issued an update which fixed the lte dropping issue, now this phone is perfect",27,4
Sony,"After a few months of use, I could say this phone was the best phone I ever had, I was sick of Apple and Samsung, I am so satisfied with this phone.The only problem with this phone is the poor battery life .. otherwise, if you consider the pricing this is the best phone .. large screen , impressive performance, and Selfie King !Compared the screen quality with a Galaxy Note 5 and because the Note 5 comes with Higher Resolution it shows better picture, but screen quality is same as iPhone 6x ..I am using T-MOBILE and Network works prefect, 4G / Everything Prefect..Speaker quality is good, make sure to update the phone to latest version.. Sony's latest update will resolve many problems and do reset factory after update make the phone to boot up clean on new firmware and then install your programsit has not much bloatware like provider locked cellphones BUT consider buying Extra Memory it doesn't cost you much .. because there is not much space left on the cellphone storage ( > 10GB )UNFORTUNATELY as today I couldn't find a good screen protector for it, all you can buy are junk** I attached a photo about the camera Performance and Cellphone Package itself **",14,5
Sony,"The phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it's asleep. Apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with WiFi scanning. Sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. I like the phone so much that I would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that I don't think that's possible. For example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. Even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn't alleviate the problem for me. I'm disappointed that I am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little ""tin-y"" and seems to be the perfect size I'm looking for in a phablet. The white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. The only things I would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. Moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. Have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it's a fast charge, but coming from a Samsung note 4, it's far from a fast charge. Might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). And fix the battery drain bug asap.UPDATE: If anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, I have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 Battery Plus and also turning off WiFi scanner in the settings menu. This seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until Sony fixes it. Hope this helps you like it did for me.",14,1
Sony,"Great 6 inch device for the money! Got to hand it to Sony for making an excellent mid-range smartphone. This XA Ultra screams quality with it's camera, screen, and those side bezels are sexy af. Battery life hasn't been much of an issue.Favorite out of the entire Xperia lineup.",17,5
Sony,"Color - Mineral BlackI am transitioning from Oneplus 3 to Xperia XZ. I am satisfied with the performance my current phone but I am making this shift to XZ only for the design aspect and camera. I have been waiting so long for Sony to release an all rounder phone that can compete with other flagships in the market and this time they nailed it.Pros:Performance: Crisp and fast without any lag.Design: IMO, this is the best looking handset among the current flagships(including iphone 7 and pixel). It's been 3 days since I started using it, and it had already drawn attention from my friends. In one word it will put all the flagships to shame. Thumbs up for the mineral black color.Camera: Manual mode is a killer. Auto focus and video quality is also good. Indoor and low light shots are great if you can tweak little bit in the manual mode.Fingerprint sensor: If you can spend some time and flash the software with UK version, then you will probably unearth one of the amazing and effective finger print sensors in the market. It seems to respond faster than iphone6s, iphone 7 and oneplus 3.Display: Nothing to complain.Speakers: Dual speaker are really cool.SD Card: Not yet installed a micro sd card. So could not comment on that yet.Water proof: Have not tested and no intentions to do it.Cons:Battery: Its just satisfactory. I use my phone quite a bit during day(at least 2 hour talk time, 3 hours of listening music, 1 hour of bluetooth streaming in the car, 2 hours of browsing, social networking and video streaming combined). An extra 10% could have been better in my case.Wish list:Charging Time: Oneplus3 and Pixel has fast charge option that can charge 60% of the phone in 30 mins. I miss that feature in Xperia XZ. It usually takes 60 minutes for 60% charge.Overall: Sony has finally hit the cord by packing all the best and cool features into one single handset XZ. Be it camera, display, performance, fingerprint sensor or dual speakers it perfected each of those features. Price wise it is on the higher end of the spectrum competing with Samsung and Apple. Sony is a premium brand which uses finest materials. It is perceived as an upscale brand even before apple started working on it's ipods. At the same time I would not waste money if they deliver incompetent products(which is the case of some of their earlier xperias).But if a Sony product can compete with Samsung and Apple then I would not mind paying the premium. If you don't want to be one in millions using Iphones and Samsungs and yet do not compromise on quality and performance then the answer is ""Own an Xperia XZ"".",57,5
Sony,"Beautiful design. Feels expensive and good in the hand, not too big not too small but of course is is relative as we all have difference size hands.Amazing screen! The colors are rich and vibrant when using it, viewing pics, or watching videos.Powerful! It flew threw setup and installing my last Android backup in record time. Also it updated to Nougat while I was setting it up for the first time, so the latest Android OS right from the start was a great bonus!Yes the international version is 64GB of internal memory vs the US's 32, but with up to 256 MicroSD expandable memory, that's not really an issue. Plus not all US carriers provide full bandwidth support for the international version (i.e. you might not get LTE, only 4G) so do your research before buying based on specs alone.Price is right compared to other phones on the market, i.e. the new Google Pixel. I had already pre-ordered my XZ but watched the Pixel announcement and really liked what they are finally doing, but also had some concerns: 1) it's first gen tech. Google is an amazing company but i've been burned before and make it a point to never buy 'the first' of any new tech that's released. 2) it's expensive! if you get the big 128GB model and the insurance it's going to sent you back just under $900 bucks. That's asking a lot for a smartphone, even one that's 100% Google made. So when i looked at the two, i stuck with my XZ and couldn't be happier.And battery life has been really good. Using it all day (8AM to 9PM) without charging and still have 30-40% juice left. Mine came with Sony's rapid charging wall-plug, and I bought some Anker 3.0 USB-C cables (bought through Amazon of course ^_^), so she charges very quickly. I think in under 10 minutes I went from under 50% battery life to 100%.I'm not a tech professional by any means, I'm just your average consumer that's tech savvy and values my dollars going to quality products that I'll get at least 2-3 years solid use out. Yes, there are other Android phones on the market with bigger/better technical specs, but not everything needs to be 100% top-end. If you do that you get crap battery life because that bigger processor and better screen and finger print scanner and all those other 'nice to haves' need juice to run. The more you tack on, the harder the phone has to work, the hotter it runs and the crappier the battery life is. So I'm happy with the Sony XZ because it takes advantage of everything I want in a premium phone, has high-end specs that work in its beautiful design, and they made it so it works as hard without over doing it.All in all it's one of the best Android phones I've ever used, and I've used all the majors (Samsung, Motorola, and HTC) and none of them compare to this. I only hope it sells well so that Sony further invests in the US market because we've been waiting for high-end Android phones like the XZ for years.",31,5
Sony,"I'm coming from an iPhone 6s and have really enjoyed the phone. Especially if you have a PS4 at home, the remote play feature is really fun. Pretty neat to access your PS4 all across the house. The rounded edge makes the phone really comfortable to hold, and is easy to reach all areas of the phone. Great camera, overall phone feels quick and responsive. However I do want to make any potential US buyers aware. I am on the AT&T network and am unable to access their LTE network. After hours of troubleshooting with AT&T and on my own, many different APN settings, I have discovered the issue. Because it is a non AT&T phone they aren't likely to help you, but if you can get them to set your account an AT&T IMEI number, a demo phone maybe, or you could purchase a cheap LTE go phone, you could have it work then. You are simply tricking their network to think you are on an AT&T phone. I've had a lot of frustration so hope I can help out someone here. As I said, overall I have really enjoyed the phone, but wanted to make people aware of the LTE issue with AT&T.",12,4
Sony,"The phone doesn't work with T-Mobile SIM card, contacted Sony officials and they told me they do not know which carrier is compatible with Xperia and asked me to contact the seller. According the Amazon representatives, I got a bad phone, they don't have inventory so I have to get a refund. I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this issue, but it's very annoying.Extra star for good looking",12,2

If you previously held a lollipop, the permissions are going to get you on your nerves but you can manage itQuiet expensive but considering it is a new phone, it is almost worth the priceHow you can get the fingerprint scanner? You can buy an international version which I didn't find convenient or you can follow this [...]The fingerprint scanner is a software limitation only and you can flash it to get the fingerprint enabled, same way as I did with the UK version. Does it void your warranty? Only if you root it and UNLOCK the bootloader of the phone. Flashing a sotware is like installing and update, but unlocking the bootloader is not and you don't have to do it to get the fingerprint scannerIn general, it is a good phone and if you think that you need t buy an international version only to get the scanner you might be wrong",26,5
Sony,"This review is for the Sony Xperia XZ. To start, I'm running T-Mobile here in the northeast. Also, we have other Xperia phones (Z Ultra, Z3 and Z5), and this is replacing a Samsung Galaxy S7, as my patience with Samsung and Apple is exhausted. (My wife has always had Samsungs and even she was getting ticked off) First, I'm 100% convinced that so called ""Experts"" who review phones are being paid by the phone manufacturers, and I'll explain. Take screen resolution. They complain that a particular phone is weak based on specs. Never mind that your eye can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p with screen sizes less than 46"", any 5"" phone that doesn't have 1080p is committing the ultimate sin in the view, as long as it's not Apple. For me, the order of importance in a phone is the following (starting with the most important): A) It should be able to get a good signal from a cell tower. B) The WiFi should work well and be stable C) The camera should take nice quality pictures. D) It should be snappy and respond quickly E) The build quality of the device and display.My wife has the S7. Wherever we traveled, she'd hit weak spots and lose connectivity, while those of us with the Sony phones never have issues (she has had issues in the heart of Manhattan, while I'm getting 5 bars with my old Ultra). At home, I have 3 access points, and the channels are spread out. All the Sony phones have no issues switching from one AP to another, while the Samsung would lose it's mind. The Cameras are equivalent (edge to Sony), the Samsung has a nicer display, but the build and feel of the XZ is just at another level. As the older Xperias Z's are superior to any of the Samsungs, the new XZ is magnitudes better (there is just no comparison).and that's why I brought up the issue of ""professional"" reviews. This phone makes the previous Xperias look cheap and they are great phones in and of themselves. How Sony is not dominating the market is beyond me. I don't know much about the LG and HTC phones, but having owned an iPhone and various Samsung Galaxy phones, they can't hold a candle compared to this new XZ",25,5
Sony,"Lovely phone, silky smooth operation, photos look great. Could not be happier. Getting a better TMobile signal strength than my previous Sony Xperia Z5 for some reason, more signal bars in a given geographic area. I forgot to call TMobile to update new phone IMEI number and it disconnected from network after a while. I just called to update them with new phone info and it works like a champ again. Oh yeah- no bloatware.There is no other phone I'd want to own. Period.",13,5
Sony,"I've had this phone for a number of weeks now and am very pleased overall.When I was looking to buy a new phone I was comparing this one specifically to Google's Pixel. Some of my initial concerns were getting updates timely, durability, and price.The hardware is standard for 2016 phones. The Pixel has a slightly newer processor that's negligibly faster. It was a disappointment the XZ only had 3GB of RAM though. This was still an upgrade from my previous phone however. There's also 1 very important fact to keep in mind when buying the latest and greatest in processing power - battery life. The Pixel had a beefier (ever so slightly) processor, and yet a smaller battery. Battery life will take a hit because of that. I was much less worried about it with this phone. The XZ (in the US) doesn't have a fingerprint sensor which is a bummer but I'm not going to miss it. The camera IS as high quality as Sony claims. I love it and can get off 10+ pictures without slow down.One of the reasons I was looking into the Pixel was because it would be nice to have a pure android phone. Samsung phones have that god-awful TouchWiz business and Sony's have the Xperia UI. You also have to wait for updates. I'm currently still waiting for Android 7.0 which I'm getting impatient for. The one thing I like about the Xperia is the customizability. Everyone Oo's and Awe's when they see my phone because the menus, buttons, etc all look extremely different from a normal android and they're surprised to find out I haven't rooted it.Some features this phone has that I couldn't get with Google's.Waterproofing - This was HUGE for me. I don't go around getting my phones wet however I have dropped one in the toilet before. That slip-up will destroy non-waterproof phonesSD card slot - If the phone has 64GB of internal memory or more it's not an issue. Unfortunately to get that with the Pixel it massively hiked the price. Beyond what this phone cost.Front facing speakers - This was also a big deal for me. I listen to music quietly in the mornings when getting ready and can't wear headphones while doing it. I hate the way sound comes out muffled when the speakers are pointed somewhere else.In the end I decided I could live with the Xperia interface, one gig less of RAM and slow updates. I like the way this phone looks. It's unique. Sony goes the opposite direction of simply copying Apple like Google did with the Pixel. Anything hardware-wise the Pixel had over the XZ, this phone beat with additional features (like the waterproofing). I feel like for the money I'd rather buy those features than a sliver of improvement in hardware.",13,5
Sony,"This phone is a powerhouse, I owned the z3, z3+ and now the XZ and I gotta say this is the best I've seen since the super reliable z3 and the battery life is comparable if not better then the Z3 and for those of you that don't know the battery on the Z3 was outstanding. The display on the XZ is unbelievably clear, it's very well made, love the design, it's ridiculously fast like the absolute fastest camera and shutter I have ever seen on a smartphone. Auto focus is unreal and camera app opens instantly (huge improvement of past Sonys). Highly recommend",15,5
Sony,"The Xperia XZ is truly a beautiful device. While the ""slab"" appearance my turn some people off, it's very comfortable to hold, and is narrow enough that it never feels like it's about to fly from your hand. The display, while not mind-boggling in terms of specs, borrows heavily from Sony's television expertise, and looks more ""natural"" playing HD movies than the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge.Sound quality, while maybe not quite to BoomSound's bar on earlier HTC devices, is also surprisingly good. It may not be the ""best"" Android device I've used for media consumption, but its the most enjoyable.Signal quality is something of a mixed bag. In places where other phones have marginal LTE coverage, I noticed the Xperia would drop to 3G more often than not. In places with stronger LTE coverage, I was seeing results like this when comparing with the same SIM:OnePlus 3: 32mb down / 8mb upGalaxy S7 Edge: 33mb down / 8mb upiPhone 7 Plus: 35 down / 7mb upXperia XZ: 27 down / 4mb up(Tests were run multiple times, and results are rounded and averaged.)The digitizer is nice and accurate, with almost perfect sensitivity. And throughout the device, there are numerous design cues that took me back to the Clie series of PDA's back in the long-long-ago. Even the no-needle-necessary SIM/SD tray is a welcome addition. You really do get a sense that this phone is ""expensive"" and attention was paid to every detail.Except one.This should all point to a higher rating, but the disappointing and deal-breaking discovery for me is that Sony chose to disable adoptable storage (at the time of this writing, there's not very extensive coverage of the phone, so this may be a more obvious deficiency in the future). I knew out of the gate that this only has 32GB, but with the inclusion of MicroSD support and every other ""nice"" feature of the phone seems to imply that it would just be there. It isn't, and enabling it over ADB doesn't work. So out of the box, with only software updates to the preinstalled apps and two weeks worth of my GMail account, 40% of the internal storage was already spoken for.While that might be acceptable for many, the second shoe dropped when it came to using the SD card as a media repository. Playback of Sony's own demo movies from the card (A Class 10 SanDisk Ultra) were choppy, and the transfer speed was dramatically slower than in my S7 Edge. My guess here is for whatever reason, Sony decided to go cheap here.And that, sadly, is why I'll be returning the phone. Were it not for that awful decision, it would be hands-down the best Android device I've used.",17,3

Sony,"I purchased this phone from ""Quality Deals Shopping Center""It was purchased on 10/30/2016 and the phone was shipped out next day by ""Quality Deals Shopping Center"" from Taichung, Taiwan with DHL express mail (no additional cost).I received the phone on 11/3/2016, the invoice/receipt (from authorized Sony Taiwan store) was also included in the package.It means you get one year warranty from Sony mobile in Taiwan (in case that make a difference for you).Taiwan is one of the biggest market for Sony Mobile and Sony usually packs extra features on their phone released in Taiwan compare to US (which is one of the main reason I decided to get one from Taiwan).Xperia XZ box is sealed as shown in the picture.This is a Sony F8332 phone with dual SIM and 64 GB internal storage (US version is only 32 GB in storage).Following are included int the box:1. Sony F8332 mobile phone2. Sony MH410c earphone3. Sony AC-0051-TW 2700mA USB charger4. Sony UCB20 USB type C cableSince this is Taiwan version of XZ, fingerprint scanner is enabled right out of box (no need to root like US version).Dual SIM card works well which can be easily controlled via settings menu.Currently I am using T-mobile nano SIM with 128GB Sandisk micro SD card which boast total storage to almost 200 GB.Quick speed test on the T-mobile network yields around 36 Mbps near my home.Note: 4G+ on the screen capture is equivalent to US LTE+ (as other countries use 4G to indicate LTE).Xperia's OS is very close to vanilla android and currently XZ is on Android 6.0.1This is a solid choice if you are looking for a different choice compare to normal Samsung S7, LG G5 and HTC 10 (or even iPhone 7/7 plus for iOS)",11,5
Sony,"Nice phone, 64gb, dual sim confirmed. shipped from Taiwan.",24,5
Sony,Sony Xperia - outstanding as always! XZ has improved so much over Z5!Taiwan version with fingerprint sensor enabled! YEAH!Extremely fast delivery!#‡?›†ø¬†??‘??†«,13,5
Sony,"This phone is WAY better than some of the review websites give it credit! I have the international version, which unlike the U.S. version, gives you the fingerprint sensor capability. I highly recommend this version. You do take a risk though because Sony probably will not honor a warranty repair if you need one inside the U.S.A. But the convenience of the fingerprint sensor is invaluable and worth the trade-off in the event of a defect.This phone is at the top end in terms of size when compared to most 5.2"" screens. And the squared off corners do take some getting used to. However, the materials, fit and finish are top tier (and I've had a lot of phones, both Android and iOS to compare this to). The screen blends flawlessly into the body due to its waterproof capability. The phone's case is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. The screen's color gamut is more closer to authentic to true colors than on previous Sony phones as well as many other phones out there. I found it more realistic than a Galaxy S7 I have. It's absolutely beautiful. I also like the right amount of brightness it displays, not too dim, not too bright. I had a ZTE Axon 7 that was always too dim, requiring me to brighten the display to make it more readable and pleasing to the eye. Not so with this phone. Sony's adaptive brightness feature works great. I think Sony hit the mark with this one.I can only describe the phone's speed and operation as very fluid. There are no pauses or hiccups. The Snapdragon 820 processor and Android Marshmallow are the right recipe for this phone. The back of the phone will only get very mildly warm when the phone is put through heavy processing tasks. Probably slightly less than many other premium phones I have used.I like the camera very well, although like many reviewers, it is not in the same caliber as the iPhone 7 that I also have. That camera is outstanding. This Sony has some very different color representations in photos that to me, are not very natural, like skin tones for example. The iPhone produces some very realistic skin colors. However, the Sony is still a good camera, better than on most phones.I am using this phone on AT&T in the U.S. and it works flawlessly. I consistently get LTE speed most everywhere I go.The only take away I have for this phone would be the squareness of the corners, which will take some getting used. And the fact the U.S. version does not have fingerprint sensor capabilities. Sony - come on, you need to fix this please!!! Pay what you need to pay on the necessary patents and get it done! Once they do, they have the potential to really sell some phones. Otherwise, this is a really GREAT phone and I highly recommend it.",21,5
Sony,"This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. The display is gorgeous, the processor is very fast, the camera is great, and it is waterproof!The Display:The 5 inch display on this phone has a resolution of 1080p. That is the same resolution as your HD tv on a 5 inch screen. This makes for 443 pixels per inch which results in an incredibly sharp picture. You cannot see pixels at all. The display also has Sony's Mobile Bravia Engine 2 which enhances color contrast while watching videos and viewing pictures. This really makes the pictures and videos pop, it makes them incredibly vivid. When the BE2 is not running the display's contrast is not as high, but you don't always need oversaturated colors. The viewing angles are far from stellar but most people will view the screen straight on anyways. Gaming with this screen really is a treat. The display is one of the best around.The Processor:This phone is powered by a quadcore 1.5 ghz Krait S4 chip coupled with 2gbs of ram. This results in incredibly fast performance even when multitaksing. The phone almost never lags. The Krait cores are very quick and are more than adequate, even with a 5 inch full HD display. All the games I have played run well. Browsing the internet is equally as snappy. Pages load quickly and smoothly. Zooming in and out is very quick as well.The quadcore processor in this really flexes its muscles in benchmark tests. I got around 7900 in the quadrant standard, over 2060 on the Geekbench 2, over 20,000 on Antutu, and over 2800 on Passmark Performance. All of these scores are higly impressive and show you what kind of power the device has. The performace does carry over to real world usage.The Cameras:The rear camera is 13.1 megapixels and takes incredible pictures. It has the Exmor RS sensor which adjusts numerous things for you. For the most part the results are stunning. Images come out clear and the colors are very vibrant. Occasionlay you will need to change a few setting around to get a better picture though. For example disabling flash. The camera never fails to impress me. With a camera like this there is no need to carry an actual digital camera around.The front facing camera is 2.2 megapixels and can shoot 1080p video. This is very impressive for a front facing camera because most of the current ones are only capable of 720p.The Buttons and Interface:This phone utilizes the on screen android buttons. They are very responsive and don't take up too much space. The side buttons (like the power button and volume rocker) are responsive and easy to press as well. I have no complaints about the buttons.Sony has there own overlay for the Android OS. It is very light and very pleasing to the eyes. It has many great features such as small apps. With small apps you can open a miniature app while running another at the same time, both on the screen. For example, you can open a calculator while on the browser. This feature can be incredibly useful and convenient. I prefer Sony's overlay over Samsung's TouchWiz. My only real complaint when it comes to Sony's overlay is that it lacks a default task manager.The on sceen keyboard is very responsive and auto-correct works well. Turning the phone sideways gives you a lot of room, especially if you have larger hands.The Music Player:A lot of people use their phones as there music players and some phones have horrible audio quality. This phone is not one of those phones. Audio quality is great and there are many different settings that you can adjust to get the best sound. You have five band equalizers and all kinds of different options such as a dynamic normailizer which adjusts the volume differences between songs. Even though the phone has all these options I find myselfy using the ""Clear Audio+"" option. This automatically adjusts the equalizers for each song and the result is great. All the songs sound nice and, well clear with this feature.The music player is very nice to look at, it changes color based on the album artwork which is very neat. You can create playlists on the phone and even edit the music info. If you spelled the name of a song wrong when transfering it, you can fix it right there on the phone. If you are missing album artwork you can get it right on the phone. I am very pleased with the music player on this device.The ""Waterproof featue"":This phone is designed to survive under one meter of water for up to half an hour at a time. While most people will avoid getting their phones wet it is a comforting feature to have. It is also a unique feature for a high end smartphone. It means you won't have to say ""bye"" to your phone if you drop it in the bathtub.The Battery Life:Battery life on the phone is decent. It is nothing great. I get about 1 and a half days of moderate to heavy usage before I have to charge it (with stamina mode enabled). The phone has ""Stamina Mode"" which turns off things while they are not in use. This does help the battery life quite and bit and is a useful feature.Connectivity:This phone is a GSM phone and is capable of HSPA+ 4G. This one is NOT LTE Capable. This is not a factor for me because my provider doesn't offer LTE.The wifi connector on this phone is good. It has a good range and is allows for a quick and strong connection. Of all the devices in my house it is able to get the fastest upload speeds on the exact same connection.Storage:The phone comes with 16gbs of storage but allows expansion via a micro sd card slot. Only about 11.7gbs of the internal storage are available for usage but if you have a micro sd card you can have more than a sufficient amount of storage for your pictures, music, videos, and applications. My only major complaint with the storage is that it doesn't allow the transfer of apps to the SD card. This feature would be very useful.Conclusion:This is an incredible phone and is a great deal. It offers incredible performance and an amazing display. Sony has a great overlay that is innovative and light on the processor. The camera is of stellar quality and the overall build of the phone is as well. It is not a cheap plastic phone. In addition it can survive being submerged in water which is something that no other phone in its class can boast. This is an outstanding phone and I am very satisfied with it!UPDATE (1/2/14):The phone is now running on android 4.3 and the newer OS brought many small improvements with it.Main Changes:-The Music Player is now much louder. It's about as loud as my Ipod Touch now.-The Camera UI has changed slightly. It's now more similar to the one found on the Z1.-You can now download additional theme packs from the Play Store.-The color calibration in the home screens and app screens has changed slightly.-Synthetic Benchmark scores have improved. The phone now scores about 9000 on Quadrant Standard.",120,5
Sony,"...and I've had quite a few. After learning it's lesson with the heavy-handed (and painfully slow) Timescape, Sony's Android skin is smooth and silky, never more so than on the Xperia Z. I am honestly surprised how much I fell for this phone, as am huge tech junkie and go through 'em quick either through contract or importing 'em outright. But the Z is solid, the weight is great, and is sexy as all get-out. The update Walkman app is a fine and fluid hub for all your music, and with the SD card slot, you can really pack 'em in. Camera is fantastic, tho can't touch Nokia's Lumia 1020 (who can?). Forget the nitpicking you've heard over the viewing angles of the screen-with clarity and color like this, you're gonna spend all your time staring at it head on. Waterproofing is lagniappe but very cool. While Samsung is busy copying and churning out the same old stuff and cheap design, Sony is going through the stratosphere on sleekness, speed and style. My sim card has been stuck in this phone ever since I got it, and if you knew me, you'd know what a big deal that is. Can't wait to pair it with the Smartwatch 2, on it's way. Touche, Sony and keep it up!",11,5
Sony,"I got new Sony Xperia Z phone.After 3 months,my phone dropped and causes the touchscreen not to work.I contacted Sony technical support to fix my phone.As I was told it is not a warranty issue, I was advised to pay $185 flat rate for the repair.They created an RMA on 07/12/2013.I sent my phone to Sony repair center.After delivery on 7/18/13, I got an email from Sony that they will repair my device within 14 Business days starting from the date of delivery. They will contact me within that period to pay $185 for the repair in case the damage is not warrantied.I called Sony on 8/6/13 and I was told that my phone will be shipped back the following day and they will email me the tracking#.I called them again the next day and they confirmed the same information.I called them on 8/8/13 requesting any updates.To my surprise, they escalated my case to a manager called Eddie.He affirmed they will contact me within 48 business hours.Unfortunately I never got a call back.On 08/12 I called them again.I spoke with another manager who did not bother wasting his time with me informing me that Eddie has left for the day and I have to call back the following day.Tuesday, I called and spoke with Eddie.He said that there is no part for my phone that is why it is on hold.He promised me to check if they can replace the phone.Eddie called me the following day stating that Sony will replace my phone and if I do mind if the color is black.This is the only color they have in stock.I did not mind.So Eddie confirmed that they will ship the new phone out that day and I will be receiving my phone the following day.AS I did not receive anything on 8/15, I called Eddie back to ask for a tracking number. He told me that he will get back to me by the end of the day with a tracking#.I was so surprised when I received a call from Sony, speaking with a supervisor Carlos who told me that my phone was evaluated and it is not a warranty issue.They won't repair it and they will send it back",36,1
Sony,"I'm from Venezuela and my phone works perfectly with Movistar. I tried it with Digitel and it worked fine. The very good camera, it's a fast phone. I took pictures under water but the phone when under a stream open and close applications and is annoying, but if it is in a pool or beach works perfect.",32,5
Sony,"I have had the phone for 2 weeks now, and it is just GREAT!!! it is fast, the camera is great, even in low contidion, in fact, it is like having a camera, that you can talk through! videos are just incredible, the screen look just perfect. Don't believe all you read! I saw a lot of reviews that criticized the quality of the screen, it looks great! it's perfect image! true colors. As far as games, you can play whatever you want, NO glitches.I am more than pleased, with this phone, money well spent!",32,5
Sony,"Just got it.Switched from my Galaxy Note 2...it's smaller but not that much so.The screen is High Definition but it's a bit washed out.It charges very quickly but the battery life is not good.GPS starts up very quickly for Navigation unlock my GSII.The phone is beautiful...very distinct.I don't like how you can see the gridlines of the touchscreen in certain lighting (can't on my GSII).Speakerphone for phone calls is not that great; music sounds good but the volume isn't that great.These are my first impressions. I'll update later.***Updated***OK - Back to Amazon my Xperia Z went. KUDOS to Amazon for having such a wonderfully efficient return/refund process. I returned the phone Monday, it arrived at their Lexington, KY warehouse Tuesday and refund was back in my bank account Wednesday. Wow.The phone was well made, great materials. But the washed out screen, HORRIBLE battery life, and tinny sounding 'speaker' made the phone just not worth it. Don't tell me about 'turn wifi off, turn GPS off, turn data off'..You may as well just TURN THE PHONE OFF. If you can't use the features of the phone, what's the point?The relief I felt when I switched back to my beautiful and capable Galaxy Note II was very surprising. I LOVE my Note II.For the record, I 'abuse' the heck out of my Note II all day long and the battery lasts all day and night.",12,2
Sony,"I bought the Xperia Z 6602 model about 6 weeks and absolutely love it. I bought it because it met most of my criteria. It's water proof. I'll take their word for it. I had a bad experience once with a Motorola Razr that was supposed to be waterproof as well but turned out not to be as water proof as they said it was. Moving on, I also wanted a quad core with a decent amount of ram and Sony delivered very well on both. I updated mine to 4.3 as soon as I got it and it's very snappy, no lag at all. I also wanted an SD slot so I could transfer the 32gb card from my old Samsung along with all my data. Plus I wanted an android phone. I have an iPad and really like apple products but I find iTunes to be more trouble than it's worth. I run Windows 8 on my desktop and like Windows but not on my phone. Windows RT has a long way to go before it's ready for prime time. To me, Android is the only viable choice for a smart phone.I also wanted a decent camera with a flash and Sony delivered here as well. It takes pretty decent pictures but it's not perfect. In my opinion the iPhone cameras are more user friendly and take slightly better pictures. The thing with the Sony camera is you have to play with the settings to get nice pictures. It has a superior auto feature that is supposed to take nice pictures without any manual settings but they seem to come out better if you set it up manually. In daylight the pictures are perfect. It's the low light where things get tricky. There's a lot of camera software and options on this phone that you won't find on any other smart phone. If you're willing to play with the different filters and focus options you can get some nice low light pictures with it. I find the single auto focus and backlight correction seem to produce the best low light pictures. For me it doesn't quite replace my pocket camera and definitely not our SLR camera either but for a smart phone camera it's more than adequate.I also wanted high speed mobile data and the HSPA+ is way better than my old 3g Samsung. It would be nice if they would include an LTE radio on the 6602, but it's not going to happen. If you want a US market Xperia Z with an LTE radio in it you have to get the 6606 from T Mobile but then you get a T Mobile Logo on the back, and another T Mobile logo on the lock screen and it uses their custom boot loader so for me I'd rather live without the LTE radio and stay with the unlocked model. And by the way, don't buy the 6603 model if you're planning on using it in the US. It's designed for use overseas and will not give you LTE or HSPA+ bands in the US. It will only give you the old Edge network which is like going back to dial up.The other thing I wanted was an NFC chip. This is actually my biggest gripe about the Sony. It has the NFC chip and supports android beam but due to the secure element it is blocked from working with google wallet for tap and pay. There are some work arounds like rooting the phone and using root explorer to change the device name to something like Nexus or Galaxy but you shouldn't have to root your phone just to be able to pay for a cup of coffee with your phone. My current solution is using the google wallet debit card. Also from what I've read the Kit Kat update which is due out this month is supposed to fix the google wallet issue.My other requirements were for it to be unlocked and it is. I wanted to have tethering built in natively without rooting or apps and it is. Also SIP is built in natively and works perfectly, no apps required. I needed GPS and of course it has it and it works very well. My other and one of my main requirements was good sound and Sony hit the nail on the head with the sound quality. I love the Walkman app and also the built in FM radio is a very nice touch.One of the other best features on this phone is the chipset control widget. It's very nice to not have to go in to settings to control wif, Bluetooth, mobile data, nfc, backlight, etc. You can control them all from the widget. Very useful. The battery life is very acceptable, no complaints there. I also wanted screen capture which is built natively into Android now and works great by pressing the power button and volume down button for one second.And probably my biggest requirement is for the phone to work well and it really does. The first call I made to my friend Jim, he said ""Where are you calling me from, it sounds like you're in the next room."" Very clear calls and great cellular reception even in areas with weak signals where other phones would be dropping the calls the Xperia just works.One thing lacking at this time is a built in emoji keyboard for texting friends with iphones. It comes with Whatsapp pre installed with an emoji keyboard that works great. However, I understand that the Kit Kat update will finally add an emoji keyboard as well so hopefully that will be resolved soon.What I really like about this phone is how thin and light it is. I also like not having the same phone as everyone else. And the size of the phone seems to be more in the phablet category than the phone category but that's ok. It still fits in my pocket and since I got it I don't have to carry my iPad around with me at work anymore because the 5"" screen size is big enough to actually read email and view web pages on.Basically there are way more pros to this phone than cons. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality, unlocked, GSM smart phone at a reasonable price. If you're a hard core tech junkie and want the latest updates as soon as they come out and an LTE radio in an unlocked phone then maybe you should buy a Nexus. For a skinned, unlocked android phone, the Xperia is the best of the best.",23,5
Sony,"Steve Jobs made me mad when my perfectly good iphone 3 was made functionally obsolete by an update in iOs. I was in the market for a tablet at the time. In an effort to get even with apple I actively sought an alternative to their ecosystem. After looking at several android tablets, I settled on the Sony tablet S- their first android tablet (I should probably identify myself as a Sony fan boy...). It has been a year and a half and have been pleasantly surprised- in fact, I'd say that I prefer android now.So with that as a backdrop, I'll now tell you about the Xperia Z- I have had it for just short of two months. At the start, it took some adjustment to how it gets things done versus iOs- subtle differences that were unfamiliar at first. After working thru that break in and learning how stuff works, I can say that I am very happy with this phone. It works without hiccups and has been very smooth. Every function I've tried has worked- ""throwing"" media to a dlna compatible device is still a bit jerry and hit or miss. Integration with other Sony products is solid to the extent that the other Sony products are modern enough to be integrated. The phone is well made, thoughtfully laid out, and sized to be functional in the hand. The screen is responsive to touch, gorgeous to behold. Sony's tweaks on stock Android are unobtrusive and often very functional additions (my wife wishes her Samy phone could run some of the Sony ""small apps"" and a few of the other proprietary Sony stuff). Android 4.2.2 came a few weeks ago and offers some enhancements over the previous edition. Sony also introduced a ""find my Xperia"" function which seems to work well in the testing I've done with it. It's nice to be able to wash this phone off too. I purposely avoid wristwatches, and footware that are not waterproof- to not have these items waterproof just doesn't make sense in my life. And I would add a phone to the list of things that will have to be waterproof in my life going forward. It's hard to think of another item that you use daily while you are out and about, that you handle in public places and then put up to your face without washing it off. It seems to be catching on as a concept too- I saw a new version of the Samy galaxy phone is available in a waterproof edition. It only makes sense...I would also recommend you consider purchase of a phone thru amazon where possible (without a contract) the ""bloatware"" that at&t, t-mobile, Verizon and others put on phones you get from them is just about useless, and only serves you adds from the carrier- no thank you. Alot of it cannot be removed from your phone either.In summary, I would gladly order this phone again, and I would recommend it to others.",21,5
Sony,"This phone is awesome. It's really slim with a large screen and so nice looking. Everyone compliments me on this phone. It takes gorgeous photos too! The only thing though, I have a problem with is the battery life. I have to charge it every day!",14,5
Sony,Very sharp device. Responsive even with the Sony Skinned software. Clear audio when talking. Used on T-Mobile and Indonesian Networks. Fast downloads WiFi 4g/3g. I thought it would be uncomfortable to hold due to shape. Bit the device fits very nice in hand. Listened to music while in the shower. Awesomely clear dispite the reviews stating the sound was muffled. What do you expect from a sealed device. All in all very impressed with the screen the responsiveness and the overall functioning of the phone. Kudos Sony.,17,4
Sony,"Phone has sturdy (water-resistant) aluminum case. beautiful display and all around awesome phone. I use it as an AT&T go-phone and it works great. The phone is factory unlocked with no bloatware. You will not be disappointed with this phone! I bought directly from Amazon, not vendor. I have had to many problems in the past with vendors.",12,5
Sony,"I bought this model not knowing that it couldn't be used on the 4G network with ATT, as it is only a 3G model.If I had done some more research I would have known that the model I needed was the C6906 for the 4G LTE. I was shocked that so high priced of phone wouldn't offer 4g to begin with, and I have to deduct a star on that alone. I have to say though that the phone is a lot better in responsiveness to my old LG Optimus G Pro, and I am really in love with it overall, except for the lack of 4G. :(I really love the size of the phone, and I also love the fact that I am not accidentally opening apps and the home screen every time I pick it up or put into my pocket.... the Optimus G Pro was absolutely a nightmare when it came to this and I got tired of it.I highly recommend this phone to anyone who does a lot of social networking and picture taking ,as there are plenty of apps for that already installed on the phone. The pictures that you can take with this phone are gorgeous, and I think any enthusiast would be pleased to have it.The only knock I have with the phone is that the battery life could be a lot better in my opinion, which might boil down to a software issue that perhaps Sony can fix in the future.If you look at the reviews and benchmarks on this phone concerning battery life, you will see that it has a higher battery life than most all other phones in talk time, but falls way short in web browsing and watching videos, and I can see that for myself using it to verify it.I hope that for those looking to enjoy 4G on this phone with the TMobile and ATT network will not make the same mistake I made in getting the C6902 model ,and find this review helpful",25,4
Sony,"Better than ip6, perfectly handle with 1 hand",10,5
Sony,"This is hands down the best phone if you're looking for something smaller than the 5 inch+ monsters flagships that are on the market today.The only competition on the market is the iPhone 6. So let's do a quick comparison. The Z3 Compact is about the same size as the iPhone 6, weights exactly the same, and has very similar screen in size and resolution. The Z3 has 4 cores running at 2.5 GHz with 2GB of RAM compared to iPhone 6's 2 cores running at 1.4 GHz with 1GB of RAM. Oh and it has a bigger (longer lasting) battery.Most impressive is the camera on the Z3 Compact. It is a 20MP at f/2.0 using a 1/2.3"" chip. And it shoots 4K video (which the iPhone 6 does not do).Oh and it's waterproof! So when you drop it on the men's room floor, you can pick it up and just rinse it off while bystanders gape at you like you're insane. Or when your psycho girlfriend drops it in the pool (ala Taylor Swift ""Blank Space""), as long as you fish it out in less than 30 minutes, you can text her using it and tell her it's over.And here's the kicker: It costs less than half the price of an iPhone 6. I've been a loyal Apple customer for a long time, and bought the first iPad on the day it came out. I'm sorry to say that I'm no longer willing to pay the Apple Tax.This phone works great on AT&T. First make sure you get the D5803 model. Then to get LTE data, you need to add the correct APN setting as instructed here: http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB424489&cv=820. You should have no problems. I sure didn't.",13,5

All of its functions are superb and I felt quite happy about it....but it's not the phone I'm going to gripe about in this review...After nine months of continuous and satisfactory performance, the phone can now no longer connect to call signals. It turns out the unlocked bands on the phone only last for so long. I use it in Colombia (Southamerica) and the phone is supposed to be unlocked, and it was for the first nine months of use, but now I am forced to spend about $50 bucks on having the phone unlocked again through a tedious 2 week process.

Sony,"Bought the phone 2 weeks ago. The phone came in a small box, and it is a Hong Kong version, with everything in Chinese since this is a international version of the phone. I use T-Mobile in USA, and it worked just find with the LTE. The phone did came with a VERY SMALL scratch on the side. I contact the seller, and they are willing to take the phone back for a look and replace a new one, but I had to leave town couple of days later so I did not return it since it was a very small scratch, and they were willing to accept the return. The seller however was not from Sony, it is by OE USA. The phone is also very thin and I am still not fully used to it, also I took the phone to the pool, and was able to use it for a good while, but it started to heat up and after a long while, it turn off by itself. After that I was able to turn my phone back on with no problem at all. So far I like it, will give more update later.Update Oct 21 2015- The phone seem to work fine still, one problem I do seem to be having is that when I put a phone call on speaker, the other caller seem to not be able to hear me when I talk. Not sure what is the cause of the problem.",10,4
Sony,"Absolutely beautiful, flawless phone. Can't wait to get it rooted. This phone is great in every way, the SD810 can run a bit warm under load, but cools quickly and doesn't seem to effect battery much. Sleekest phone with the best display I've seen since the Z Ultra. Would absolutely buy again.",10,5
Sony,"Replaced my S6 edge that had overheating and speed issues/no issues on this phone with over heating or slowing like my s6 other pros and cons below (Spoiler Alert: not many cons)Pros:Great Screen (Once pre-applied screen protector is removed)Fully waterproof ip68 (Trust me it is, took some underwater video in a pool)Camera is sharp and fast video looks great and color reproduction is spot on (After update)Front facing stereo speakers are loud and clear (but nexus 6 is louder and clearer)Super thin and light, but doesn't feel fragileNO CAMERA BUMP!!!!!Copper color is absolutely beautiful especially compared to samsung and apple's tacky gold (Copper is really closer to Rose Gold)Front camera is wide angle and has excellent image quality ( Yay for selfies)Battery, Unlike the S6 i actually get through a full day of normal usage (After Software Update)MICRO SD!!! Put in a 64gb card and have over 90GB to store stuff!!Lanyard loop, its great for hiking or taking photos and video underwater (Doesn't Come with lanyard though)CAMERA SHUTTER BUTTON!!!!!!! just like a real camera , press it to launch the camera even when the phone is off, half way focus full press shutter... every phone should have this (also is a requirement for underwater photography as no touch screen works underwater)Near stock android (avoids software related issues and makes things run smoooooth, (rumor is that the next update will bring an even closer to stock android experience)Cons:MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE ALL THE SOFTWARE! (otherwise you will have overheating issues and camera quality wont be as good)REMOVE SCREEN PROTECTOR THAT COMES PRE-APPLIED (it smudges more easily than the glass, it is very reflective, and it ruins the screen quality) (i was very disappointed with the display until i peeled it off)No fingerprint sensorNo OIS in the camera (but also no camera bump!)No USB Type C (although only one phone has this and you cant even buy it)This to me is the only true con, no QI wireless charging",43,5
Sony,"I felt obligated to leave a feedback because some of the negative and inaccurate reviews users were leaving led me to believe that this phone was not a good buy. I just had the all great and mighty Samsung S7 and I absolutely hated the phone! It ran a bit sluggish, in addition, out of the box the battery was horrible, and I am coming from the Sony Xperia Z3 which I only had to charge once a day. I returned the S7 $800 paperweight that T-Mobile attempted to charge me and decided to purchase the Xperia Z5 since I loved the Z3 so much, but with some of the negative reviews I almost did not purchased the phone. I am so happy that I did not listen to the negative reviews and did it. It has been less than 24hours and this phone is absolutely amazing! I have it running on T-Mobileƒ??s sim card and the service is great, no overheating, in addition I purchased a solid case to keep this amazing phone protected. I think that this is the best phone on the market right now and I wish that people would provide accurate feedback so that others who want to take a chance will also have an amazing experience as I am having. Please, if you are thinking about this phone and already know how solid Sony is, donƒ??t get despair by the negative reviews, take a chance on a brand that you know and get the phone! Life is too short to just settle for anything, treat yourself and live your life!",10,5
Sony,"Received the phone yesterday and it is as expected. I haven't gotten the device soaked yet but it is fast, runs cool, and the display looks great even in direct daylight. Didn't get outrageously warm and the battery life looks like it will outperform what reviews led me to expect. I didn't really care about or want the finger print scanner so I am not torn up about that. The phone itself is understated ""chic"" I suppose. Its solid in the hand, has a nice little loop notch which was an unexpected surprise that will probably go unused here.I am particularly impressed with the headphone output on this phone. resolution and quality of output are on par with an HTC One M8. The M8 has the edge in absolute power output but this phone is capable of making good use of a Tidal account on the go. Has enough power to drive the Shure Srh-1840 to uncomfortable levels. Doesn't seem to mind hte ultra-low impedance of the Shure SE846 although absolute refinement of sound seems to take a slight hit compared to the HTC one M8. Four hours of Tidal streaming @ CD quality seemed to eat about 10% of the phones battery driving the SRH-1840 and the screen mostly off which I consider to be another solid showing.Especially for the money, I feel its quite a nice device.",32,5
Sony,"Coming from a Z3, I had very very high expectations, but due to the recent development of a flickering display issue, I decided to give the Z5 a chance.Within 3 hours of arrival, and fresh off a system update, the phone was shutting down the camera app due to thermal issues, and I was getting notifications about temperature problems. Whether I was taking 8mp images or 60fps full hd, same problem. If a phone's primary advertising feature is its camera's capabilities, those features should work.The display has a very odd tint to it, making whites appear red/purple, and giving other colors a weird cast, regardless of the xreality settings...maybe they put too much red in their Triluminos display technology...Adjusting the color calibration brings it closer to white, but gives things a greyish cast as well.While attempting to charge the phone using the supplied adapter, it was discharging faster than it could charge...all I was doing was downloading apps through google play, and had the screen on.Maybe I just got a dud, but Sony support killed it for me when their only solution was to check the return policy of the store from which I purchased, and then get sarcastic with me when I asked if that's all they were able to suggest.If this were priced as a midrange phone, I'd be more lenient, but at more than half a grand this is just unacceptable.Given that Sony has shuddered direct US sales of this phone, and their support is all overseas, I think I'm done with Sony Mobile. Too bad, too, cause the Z3 really was incredible.",25,2
Sony,"I'm a big gamer, and I don't need to go over those features for you for the thousandth time, but after deciding not to upgrade to the Sony Xperia Z3 or Z3+ due to the heating issues, and a couple other reasons, I drooled over the Xperia Z5 specs for months waiting to buy this phone in the U.S. with a warranty. I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!",13,5
Sony,Upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Xperia Z (3 1/2 years old) which was locked; therefore I'm using the unlocked Z5 on T-Mobile and have not had any issues. I have a LTE signal on the device. One of the biggest pros for the phone is that its nearly stock android and all apps except a few can be removed completely from the device (for example i was able to remove the Google+ app which i was unable to do before). The phone is fast and fluid and i have not had any lagg on it. For me the camera is superb but I'm not a big photographer unless I'm at a concert or something. The auto-focus is extremely fast to where i don't even see it focus unless i manually use my finger to focus on a particular item. No regrets with my purchase,22,5
Sony,"Coming from the Z3C, I can't help but make some comparisons to that phoneThe good:ƒ?› Shipping was very quickƒ?› Phone was flawless in its original packagingƒ?› Very quality build and heft to it. Doesn't feel cheap or plasticky at all.ƒ?› Screen is nice and bright. Call quality is excellent.ƒ?› Easy to navigate screen interface one handed. Holding it correctly, with your pinkie under the bottom to support the phone, there should be no issue using one handed. Your thumb should be able to reach all spots on the display. As far as I know, this is the only newly released premium handset in this size/form factorThe bad:ƒ?› Like the Z3C, the back is glass, although frosted this time so the grip is slightly better. Premium feel, but very fragile.ƒ?› Despite the faster CPU, the interface is slower and not as instant as the Z3C when opening apps.ƒ?› Battery life is not as good as the Z3C, but still better than any other premium smart phone out there. I was charging every other day with the Z3C, but must charge at the end of the day with the Z5C. This is with moderate use.ƒ?› The camera is just above average. With Sony optics you would think it would be better than it is.ƒ?› When taking a photo, the camera is slow to open, and even slower to preview a picture just taken. Can be an issue when trying to catch a moment at just the right time.ƒ?› For T-mobile, although the hardware supports band 12, T-mobile's 700MHz spectrum, it is not enabled. So you may find spotty reception in areas where you had excellent reception in the past with a T-mobile phone purchased from the carrier. This is more a carrier issue than Sony, since the support is there built into the hardware.",11,4
Sony,"EDIT (1/9/16): My original evaluation of this phone remains the same but I would encourage people to look at the HTC One A9 as it addresses the US compatability aspect while still being pocketable. It is not as compact as the Z5c, meaning Sony is still the only name in the game but the A9 is still manageable. You can read my review here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017D554UKI have been through every phone you can imagine and the Sony Xperia Compact line continues to impress me. I recently had a Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x and the sizes are just to much for me. Yes, I really want Marshmallow but can wait an extra few weeks for it. I asked a few questions before buying and had trouble getting clear information due to the technical nature, but wanted to clarify for those who are looking.This phone is almost fully compatible with T-Mobile USA and I can confirm Band 12 (Extended Range LTE) *does* work (confirmed with LTE Discovery). However, there is no HD Voice, VoLTE or WiFi Calling. For me, these trade-offs were well worth it because of the phenomenal battery life (which will likely get better on Marshmallow), the compact form factor and water resistance (just nice to have as a backup). If WiFi calling is an issue for you, you can use something like Hangouts phone calls as a backup. It is of course not as convenient, but it works. HD Voice is only compatible T-Mobile <> T-Mobile and, yes, you can tell the difference and I wish I had it - but again, not a huge trade-off. VoLTE is the one that gets me. For those of you that don't know, this means the phone drops your data down to 3G/HSPA when making a phone call. Not the end of the world but you may notice the difference when navigating, tethering to your PC, trying to navigate, etc. Again, you could get around this by using a third-party dialer (Hangouts) since that is a VoIP call but for most people, this may be overkill. I suspect though most people buying this phone are pretty familiar with these things since the phone is not advertised in the US. The lack of VoLTE/WiFi Calling/HD Voice is the only reason I knocked off a star.Note the phone comes with an international charger and adapter. It is compatible with QuickCharge technology and charges rapidly for example with this?ÿSwiftrans 3221263 Quick Charge 2.0 36W Dual Ports USB Car ChargerThe camera on the phone is pretty good - not the best - but will be fine for 9/10 people.I am using the phone with?ÿAomax??

It was important to me I protected the device but didn't go overboard on the bulkiness - the combination of these two are perfect. I have reviewed each of these independently but included one picture here of the phone, glass and case together.Overall this is an awesome phone for people who aren't concerned about buying direct from a carrier and don't want a huge phone.",28,4
Sony,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3bWribaf04I have the problem exactly the same as shown in the video on YTB, and I'd like to know if the problem is only with white z5c?if yes, Can I change for another color?",14,3
Sony,"Phone arrived in 2 days. I am a US customer looking to use the unit with ATT. I received it on Tuesday, and end of day Thursday today, the phone is fully setup customized and functional, but for the carrier. I had some lingering items to wrap up on my old phone, and today I'll be getting ATT service connected. My goal was to keep a smaller phone (~4.5"") like my previous unit to preserve the 1 handed capability, and convenient pocket fit. I don't want a tablet for a phone, and have struggled to find a good modern model match for my needs. The Z5C looked to be a great match, and so far, it's a perfect fit for me.Package appeared to have been opened, however carefully, and then re-sealed. I suspect the reason it was opened was the addition of a US plug adapter for the EU style plug the unit comes with, as it does not look like a Sony converter. Where the phone uses a pretty standard 5V, 1500mA mUSB charger, of which I have a bunch, this wasn't a big deal. All other packages in the box (headphones, USB cable, extra earbud cushions, documents) were all intact and looked brand new, untouched. Phone itself still had original sticky film and packaging, and was in perfect new condition.Phone turned right on, and was ~60% charged. I was prompted quickly to change the language (second or third screen) as I ran setup from German to English I organized the OS as I prefer my phone laid out and set up and connected to wifi. The phone immediately ran two major system updates in parallel, and then after a restart, ran another. I'm now on Android 5.1.1, and admittedly, I'm not sure what it shipped with before the updates as they happened so fast.I love the square edges, which allow for some grip in a smartphone world where everything is slick and like holding onto a watersock if you don't have a cover on it. The phone looks like a sleek, black slab of sexy tech. Seriously, what a cool looking, striking design. The photos don't do it justice. I did buy a low profile cover for drop protection, and have used it intermittently. Compared to the IPhone 6 or the new Galaxy Edge, this is much easier to hold one handed without worrying about it squirting onto the pavement. That said, it's still a pretty slick and smooth piece of hardware in general, and I'd suggest a cover/protection.The phone is a great unit, and a perfect fit for my needs. I love the frosted glass back, the large screen/body ratio, and the charcoal colored polycarb frame.. I know some people take stars away for not liking the case/finish (non metal), but I find that odd. If you don't like it, why'd you drop $500 on it? It's a first class material, so the rest is just opinion. It actually has a pretty metallic look anyways. No one's going to look at this and say ""man, what a cheap looking phone. I promise. Phone does get a bit warm (which I really only experienced during the initial startup/setup), but there's a lot of horsepower in there, and that's to be expected. Nothing that bothered me.The fingerprint tech is awesome, and responds quickly and flawlessly. I have a few different fingers stored so that it's a comfortable unlock both righty and lefty. The hardware is clearly sufficient, as I've had a dozen things going on at once including downloading, a bluetooth beam, installing and updating apps, surfing a few internet tabs and writing a note all at once, and Android ran smooth, slick, quick and didn't break a sweat. Phone a very *solid* feel, very high quality, and certainly a first class phone that can be discussed in the circles of the current high end smartphone competition.Two minor drawbacks that I didn't think were worth removing a star for:1) No wireless charging. If the unit didn't have the rapid charge capability, this may have been a -1, but it charges so damned fast, and keeps charge so long, I couldn't do it. Still would be cool to drop it on those powermats at starbucks. Oh well.2) Volume buttons are too low on the thumb side (righty.) These should have been up top. I'm guessing there was a hardware conflict, but either way, it's a nitpick worth mentioning.Setup with personal and work emails was seamless, and calendar, emails and contacts all downloaded via wifi quickly and easily.I'm headed to ATT to finalize my new account and get the carrier service completed. Unless you see a follow up note from me, assume it also went smoothly.",14,5
Sony,"I am a previous owner of the sony xperia z3 compact. This version came with a micro USB cable, power brick, headphones, and some manuals( mostly were not in English). The phone will have android version 5.1.1 (lollipop) straight out of the package with a few pre-installed software that you can delete. After just receiving this phone I noticed that the design was different, and the original fingerprint magnet glass on the rear of the phone from the z3c is replaced by frosted glass. So No more finger prints. Also the phone is slightly more thicker than the z3c and the edges are more round with a matte feel to it. There is only one flap on the left side to insert a memory card or micro SD card on the side. The volume keys are now under the power button which needs getting used to for me. The phone can be charged from the bottom using a micro USB cable which is included. You no longer have to open a flap to charge the phone which doesn't change the fact that the phone is still water proof/resistant. The power button is now longer providing a finger print sensor which works flawlessly so far. I haven't got much time into the user interface but have noticed that the display is very dim compared to the z3c if the adaptive brightness setting is on. So far it feels responsive, no lag, a few tweaks in the UI, and 4G LTE works fine for me. The camera is now 23 MP with fast auto focus, and the front facing camera is 5 MP. Overall great phone, but design could have been better and display is still 720p.UPDATE: Dropped phone on concrete from just above 3ft (with no case), and slightly dented the phone's edge. Screen survived any cracks or damage and phone still works fine.",38,4
Sony,"If you want an Android *phone* - not a mini-tablet, something that fits in your hand and doesn't feel like a plate of armor in your front pocket - Sony is now the only game in town (and not in any USA towns...these are imports). I've only owned Nexi before this, but I find Sony's customizations are almost all additive, like glove mode or being able to reboot or screenshot with a click of the power button. Any uninstallable apps you don't like, just disable in Settings.I use mine without a case and with a lanyard (not included, but I bought some silver ones on Amazon for about $5), which adds no bulk, keeps the phone pure but like a case, offers (preventative) protection against drops. Some have complained about the ""lip"" of the outer frame, but I don't find it remotely bothersome in hand and it protects the glass. It's functional - something any great design must be, not just beautiful. I laugh at all the iPhones wearing ugly cases.I have noticed a couple of intermittent software bugs here & there (example: blacks sometimes look gray when waking from sleep and auto-adjust brightness is on) but nothing I can't live with, and Sony has OTA-air shipped both a firmware and a camera update in the month I've owned the phone.Battery life is great, solidly over a day with moderatly heavy screen-on time use and up to two days with Stamina mode enabled.Just buy it. I hope Sony sells enough to make Z5 Compact successors.",17,5
Sony,"I had the Z3c, replaced it with this Z5c. The 5 is a further polished version. If you are in the market for a high end phone and dislike mandatory two hand texting and holding a book to your head, this is for you.",10,5
Sony,"The Z5C is a phone I wished that Sony would bring state side, but it appears as though plans to do that aren't in the pipeline. This is probably due to the bad marketing job from Sony in America, and a botched phone agreement with a couple of the big carriers. The Z5C is a phone for someone who values a compact size phone that has power, good battery life, good camera, and isn't looking to watch videos. There are plenty of reviews out there about what the critics think, but I just want to point out a couple of big wins for me.1. This phone allows me to stream music over bluetooth headphones while taking pictures at the same time. I value this because I work at a gym and usual do both things at the same time. When I take a photo there is no skip in the music. Everything is seamless. It is something that other phones can't do (Samsung S6 Edge).2. This phone has a very stock flavor of Android. While I wish it had marshmallow right now for the SD card system integration and doze features. Sony does plan on pushing out Marshmallow for this phone. For the time being, I'll just use the SD card slot for video and photos. The Stamina feature that Sony puts on the system appears to help a lot with battery longevity.3. I can use the phone on AT&T (Not verified) or T-Mobile (verified) workingPlease don't hesitate to ask a question about the phone. I was a little nervous about purchasing it at first, but worth it.",13,5
Sony,"I really want to like this phone. It's beautiful. I can use it one handed. It fits into my front pocket. It's got a great battery life. It supposedly has an incredible camera (yet to be tested). But then I start using it... and almost immediately forget all the reasons I like it and get really angry at Sony for ruining such a beautiful phone with such crummy software.The software experience is a nightmare... the phone thermal throttles like crazy. The UI is super laggy. I've had the phone 1 day and starting the camera can take up to 15 seconds. Sony has managed to pack so much bloatware onto a phone so small that it blows my mind.While going through and trying to ""disable"" - because you can't uninstall - the garbage (e.g. augmented reality camera plugin - who the hell wants a 1980s style 3D dinosaur in their picture?), I had to stop and just contemplate that some pencil d*ck project manager approved sticking 500 useless apps - some that half-assingly replicate default Android behavior - on this phone for apparently no reason other than ""screw it.. why not?!?"". WHY SONY?! WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO US?!?I can keep going on and on.. the absolutely useless ""small apps"" that you can't completely disable.. the Sony photo album app that breaks the camera app if disabled.. there's just so much bad about the software experience that it makes me regret buying this phone.It really makes me even more sad that Sony hasn't pushed Android 6.x to this phone. It's been 6 months since Google released it.. and supposedly Sony has addressed some of the issues mentioned above in their Android 6.x OS. But for now, it's not here and all I have is this nightmare. This phone should be a no go for anyone looking for a compact phone. The software is just too bad to use on a daily basis. There's no excuse for it.Sony.. your phone is bad. And you should feel bad.** UPDATE **Feb 15: the phone is going back. Summary: beautiful phone ruined by crap software experience. For those reading the comments to this review... finding a replacement ROM and then loading on this phone is next to impossible. If you side load a ROM, you lose the DRM camera software and there's more challenges beyond that. Not worth it. Not worth it at all.",75,1
Sony,"First of all there are few choices in sub 5"" Android phones. And you probably already know why you use Android and won't switch to something else. So lets detail why you want this Android phone and not another:-It is very comfortable and has good weight in one hand-The call quality and microphones work really well (Okay google hotwords work with very very few failures)-The micro SD/SDXC/SDwhatever slot is a big deal. I put in a 200GB card and don't think about storage anymore.-The battery life is good enough if you have a strong data signal on Marshmallow-Marshmallow was available as soon as I turned it on. Upgrade available!-Limited skinning on the OS. Coming from a Nexus and later two Moto phones, I like stock android.-Contrary to many reviews I think the camera is excellent. When I use mine next to my wife's iPhone 6s she says my photos always look better. That may be because I switch to manual and use exposure compensation on most every image.-4K video is gorgeous and plays well on this tiny, low res screen. I was surprised it played at all.-Signal strength. I haven't dropped a call or failed a text on AT&T or T-Mo in 2 months. And my area has bad signal. Even when LTE says no bars I can get good speeds.-I think the speakers are very good for watching videos. I often run at half volume and that's enough. Little to no distortion.-Waterproof. Or is it? I showered with it and its fine. I dunked it in water. I washed it off. I dry after each time but that hot shower for the length of a YouTube video should be some kind of standard test.The not so good points I found were-Disabled fingerprint reader being that this is the US version. I use my Pebble watch as my ""trusted device"" so I don't mind this.-The screen is not as pretty as an OLED. Moto X 2013 had a 4.7"" OLED screen that I prefer to this one. Better blacks and better battery life.-The camera... I wan't a raw file format. Sony being an imaging company can do better.-The price. I guess I want better specs for this price after I've been spoiled by Motorola's deals or the Nexus phones. I haven't paid this much for a phone since my iPhone 3G S. I certainly could have gotten a Z3C for less but since my Moto X 2014 has similar specs and is struggling at times to keep up with basic apps I figured the Z3C would have similar issues. So I got the updated model.-I hear it overheats. I shot HD video for 10 minutes without issue. I charge and it gets hot but no noticeable issue. I'm no power user. I have no games installed. I cannot confirm any heat problems.Disappointing problems are-Battery life in poor signal area. I live in the suburbs and my LTE coverage is GARBAGE. Moto says 1 bar, Apple says 1 circle?, Sony says 0 bars. More on the disparity later. I would be at 20% by lunch until I made some changes. At work the battery lasted until dinner without using battery saving apps.-Doze replaced Stamina mode? With Marshmallow Stamina mode is gone (rumored to be returning as of May 2016) and the battery life is pretty bad without doing some homework. The Doze function only works if you don't jostle your phone so put it down and ignore it.-Low reported signal strength. Look up what signal db translates to bars and you'll see a -74db signal is full bars. To this phone its 0 bars.At home. At the gym -80db is full bars again. You cannot trust the signal strength meter and I can't figure out why. Neither could Sony support. So -110db should be 0 bars, -83db is full bars and you can figure out what is in between. I can't figure this one out. However, its signal (when looking at -db) is on par with the iPhone 6s and Moto X 2013 and 2014, all of which are known for having great radios.How to fix your problems:-Install Greenify, enable all the permissions it asks for and Hibernate just about everything (I think that helps). Enable agressive Doze (that really helps). Greenify will make Doze (the function not the app) useful and make that battery history graph go sideways instead of a sharp slope.-Its slippery. I knew this ahead of time and got a ""Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Case Compatible for Sony Xperia Z5 Compact"" and am very happy with the grip, plus it slides less and I've had a few drops with no damage. I'm not saying its the most attractive case but I have a small phone that I'm not worried about being rough with.If I missed anything or if you have any questions, fire away. Its still not perfect but if they bring back Stamina mode I think it'll be nearly so.45 day update: I've flashed the phone three times as recommended by Sony and the forums and I can't seem to get a handle on battery life. Sometimes I'm losing 1% per minute with the phone doing nothing (Google Play Services wakelock issue) even after restarts, and some days I can get though most of the day without charging. Add to that that the 4k video function only shoots for 1-3 minutes before the camera app shuts down (@115 degrees F on the back). And Sony's response to this is give us the phone and we'll have it back in 3 weeks or so. 14 business days, 2 weeks and 4 days, is their solution. I miss Motorola's loaner phone program where they'd give you a backup until they fix your phone. Free. Performance is getting very slow and I imagine its the processor getting too hot and slowing the system down. I'm worried but too far out of warranty to get a different phone at this point. I can't tell you what TO get but I can tell you what NOT TO GET.RETURN FROM REPAIRS UPDATE: They apparently lost my phone in repair for a month. I called again and all they could say is the phone had been ""scrapped."" In their warranty they say they can return your phone in pieces and its not their problem anymore. I told Amazon and they said send us the pieces and we'll refund you. I told Sony to send me the pieces so I can be refunded and they sent a replacement phone. It seems the problems (aside from it not being water resistant) stemmed from it having Android 6.0 as it doesn't overheat and crash the camera until about 15 minutes in. Stamina mode, the thing that makes the battery so good, exists so long as I don't update the OS. It still bugs me to update to 6.0 over and over and Sony says the only way to get rid of the constant popup is to do it, therefore ruining the phone. I rooted it (to allow me to stop the Sony Update app) and it works okay but that is not a solution unless you're very tech savy. Right now Youtube stopped working since rooting and I'm diagnosing that. Of course I have no warranty now because I rooted. I still can't identify a better choice but don't get this if you want Marshmallow. Don't get this if you don't want to turn down an update multiple times a day (I read days later you can adb into the phone to stop the updater without root). Don't get this if you want a phone with a warranty or customer service. Don't get this.",60,1
Sony,"Design: Beautiful phone! Love the front and back surfaces; it's isn't cheap plastic. Easy access to the SD and SIM slots.Size: Personally, I still find this compact size still a bit big but it's manageable.Apps: Yes, all manufacturers include their own apps but the amount included isn't overwhelming. There is nothing that forces you to use use the Sony apps; I just default to Google apps; I think others may have opened up the apps. Many of the included non-sony apps could be deleted. Navigation is very smooth. Not sure what emails a previous reviewer is talking about; I didn't receive a single email from Sony.Battery life: I've used Sony's stamina mode on another Sony phone and like how this one has lots more options. For example, you can select which apps has data access while your phone is on standby. Battery life is great with basic stamina mode; it may be able to last a week. There's been complaints that the phone runs hot so that was one of my concerns about this phone but during the download/installation of all the apps I use while using GPS, the phone was barely warm to the touch.I use mine on T-Mobile's network and haven't had an issue. Places where I could previously access the network still works; places where I previously could not, I still can't.",36,5
Sony,"Update 8/8/16. Although my initial review was quite positive, that didn't last long. 3 months after purchasing, I got a teeny-tiny crack in one of the corners. A week later, the entire operating system failed. I sent to Sony Repair, received it back about a month later, With a one-sentence explanation that phone was irreparable, and not covered under the warranty. They sent me back the phone, which is useless,Other issues I found before the phone went kaput.-Glass is weak-Wifi issues galore. Not only for me, but other uses in Sony Z5 forums.-Runs hot. Another well-known issue documented.**DONT BUY THIS PHONE $400+ down the drain***I have small hands for a woman, and there isn't a lot of options out there at the moment for compact cells. For me, its major factor when purchasing a phone. Performance-wise, I have only had the Xperia Z5 Compact for a week now, but so far its been excellent! Only complaint is its availability! I waivered about buying this phone - because so far Sony only offers this phone online.. Only Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H websites. There is ZERO brick and mortar stores selling this phone. I was very hesitant to purchase an expensive phone without being able to view & try it in-person. Maybe I'm old-school, but that's how I roll :) I finally took the plunge after hearing Sony's future nextgen cells, Xa's, wont have a compact option available. No regrets on my purchase though. Superfast, and haven't run into any bugs. Upgraded itself immediately from Lollipop to Marshmellow. Battery is great compared to my old Moto X. Lasted about a day and a half with moderate use.",33,1
Sony,"So I have been waiting for this phone to be available for a LONG time and am so glad it stands up to virtually all my expectations. If only they could have made it a LITTLE smaller!So the first thing I want to note is that this DOES indeed work with Tmobile with no manual setup or configuration - I just went into the Tmobile store, told them I have a phone I want to activate, they gave me the nano-SIM which I put in, turned the phone on and everything worked including MMS messages - super simple!I tested Internet speed while cell reception was on 2 out of 4 bars LTE, and was getting an average of 4 Mbps.Even though T-Mobile's wifi calling won't work, I just installed the updated hangouts dialer app and I'm all set to make calls when off-network and on only wifi from my free Google number.I don't have very big hands, but can still hold use this with only one hand which is my main objective, and it looks great too! Front speakers are great and you can really tell the difference in sound when you turn the phone sideways and allow your ears to pick up the stereo effect.In regards to the camera, the automatic mode is great. However the maximum advertised resolution for both the front and back cameras is only achieved in 4:3, not 16:9 to match the wide screen, though 16:9 is available with slightly smaller resolutions.Battery life is great with stamina mode - after a full day of being connected to my Bluetooth and typical handful of calls and several texts though leaving Internet off, I got home at 5:30 with still 93% remaining!No overheating issues as some have mentioned - it was barely even warm after playing a graphically intense game for over 20 minutes +Overall very happy with this phone, and I have high hopes for durability.",12,5
Sony,"I want to write an update for this phone. I now had this phone for 8 months. The marshmallow update 6.0.1 fixed all of the cons of this phone. Phone does get warm to the touch but that is during heavy usage. This happens when you spend 2 hours streaming or playing games and the battery drops down to 10%. You then plug it in to charge and resume your constant streaming and games.The phone does get slow when you have like 10 apps running at once. But that's with every phone. What I did enjoy was some photos i took underwater. See Photos. I really enjoy how it is somewhat water proof. Please know that it was under water for maybe less than 20 seconds.__________________________________________________________I just recently bought this phone 7 days ago. The shipping was prompted and the item looked well. This phone is really good but once the memory usage gets past 80 percent, it lags. If you are going to buy this phone, take out all the preinstalled app you wont be using and only install apps you will be using on a regular basis. It worked better after i got my memory uses below 70%",13,4
Sony,"I'm a former iPhone 5 owner and I bought this phone because I wanted an android smartphone with the same compact form factor, without sacrificing the features I'd gotten used to. The Xperia z5 compact is slightly taller and wider than the iPhone 5, but still very easy to use with one hand (the same can't be said for most other smartphones on the market!)The build quality of this phone feels great - it's got a slick glass body with a hard plastic bumper around the edge. The phone is water-resistant while still leaving the headphone and microUSB charging ports uncovered, which is a nice upgrade from the previous model (Z3 compact). Note that the phone is rated to be dust and water resistant, but not completely waterproof - Sony will not guarantee protection from activities like taking photos underwater. While I would've liked to be able to take my phone swimming with me, it's nice to know it'll hold up to rain, sweat and spills that could damage most other devices. The only flap on the phone's body covers the SIM card tray and SD card slot, but it's not a major inconvenience as you shouldn't need to access these often. It's tempting to carry this phone with no case but I'm cautious with glass-backed phones so I purchased a cheap TPU case for it in case I drop it and it hasn't been a huge compromise, it's still very pocketable. The power button, volume controls and camera button are all along the right side of the phone - another reason I like having a case on this phone is that it's possible to trigger the camera button accidentally if you aren't used to a hardware camera button.The 23 megapixel camera was one of the main selling points for me, and it's by far the best camera I've had on a smartphone! The hardware button is convenient for capturing photos quickly, although the camera interface takes a little longer to capture photos than the one built into iOS. The automatic camera settings do a decent job at capturing most photos, but if you'd like more custom options a fully manual mode is available with the swipe of a finger, along with a slew of presets for different subject matter. I replaced the stock camera app with an open source alternative because it's a little bit faster and compatible with some other apps I've installed on my phone.I've seen people complaining about bloatware, but in my experience just about every smartphone comes with some pre-installed apps. At least most of the pre-installed apps on the Xperia z5 Compact can be deleted, unlike Apple's stock apps (which I always end up putting in a folder out of my way, where they still take up precious memory). This phone comes with a generous 32gb of storage on board, but can be expanded up to an additional 200gb with a microSD card. Out of the pre-installed apps there were a few I found useful, including Sony's lifelog app, which acts as an activity counter and lets you compare your physical activity with smart detection of walking, biking or time spent in a car - as well as the activities you use your phone for, such as web browsing, gaming and listening to music. The 4.6"" 720p screen might not be the best on the market for gaming or viewing media, but the on board speakers impressed me compared to most other phones I've used, and screen size is a compromise I'm willing to make for a phone so small. Also packaged on board is Sony's Playstation remote play app, which allows Playstation 4 owners to play Playstation games on their phone. I can't speak to how well this works because I don't own the console, but I haven't experienced any lag so far playing mobile games on this phone (although the handset will heat up a little during more graphically intense titles).Overall, the Z5 compact has given me everything I want out of a smartphone during the first couple of weeks I've owned it, but I will update this review if I run into any issues. If you're looking for a small but powerful android phone that will survive daily life and occasional accidents, this is the one!",21,5
Sony,"I am very pleased with my new phone. I was nervous, having only used an iPhone up to this point, but the Xperia app and the cord made to bridge the phones to jump info to the new Xperia made this phone a very worthy replacement for my old iPhone. I couldn't be more pleased. I haven't run down the battery yet, it handles everything I need it to do, and is a very attractive phone. The sound quality is something I was worried about -- worry not! The sound quality is every bit as good as my iPhone was, if not better. The android platform really isn't that hard to get used to on this phone either. I'm already spoiled rotten, no turning back.",10,5
Sony,Great clarity for the screen - seems like 4k has arrive to cellphone.,10,5
Sony,"I've had my Z5 for about a week now and I am more than happy with it, lots of upgrades, the fingerprint scanner is super fast, responsive, accurate and we'll positioned; the camera is outstanding, the focus is top notch and colour representation couldn't be more accurate and stunning unlike iphone's saturated photos and the front facing captures a lot of detail, great for selfies. The ui remains simplistic and elegant which is why I prefer Sony's take on Android, very fast, no lagging at all and multi-tasking couldn't be easier, I use the little calculator a lot. The over-heating have been resolved although it does heat up a bit when running a lot of apps and from heavy usage and battery life is awesome!The design is stunning, you can see and feel it's premium and the frosted glass back is much better in terms of looks and how it feels. Only thing I did notice is that the front facing speakers on my Z5 were louder, but other than that, it's a great flagship phone, highly recommended and it's WATERPROOF! No need to wait for an alternative version like Samsung and iPhone hasn't ever had that feature so, yeah. Great job Sony.",10,5
Sony,"The Xperia Z5 is an improvement over the Xperia Z3+ with a new fingerprint sensor the phone if fast, I can go a whole day without charging it up I charged it the night before and the following night it still has power left. The camera is amazing and clear in low light and bright, but I expect improvements to come with updates, as I know they can do better on the software side, still the best camera on a phone.",10,5
Sony,"1. Beautiful design, looks absolutely premium.2. Camera: A huge upgrade from XPERIA Z3, I feel that it produces better photos than my LX-3 does.3. Removal of the lousy flip covers on Z3 makes the water-proof function more practical, I took it with me to Santa Monica beach and take pictures in the sea - no problem.What I don't like -1. Sometimes It can take almost 10 seconds to launch the camera.2. Battery life is not as good as Z3. My Z3 COMPACT has 70% power left after 5 p.m. and Z5 has only around 40% to 50% so it's burning almost twice of the battery.2. Overheating at the upper part of the phone (above the NFC logo), but it's acceptable as most of the time you won't be touching that area",48,5
Sony,"Please I need some help with a BIG problem with this phone. First I don't live in USA, I live in Ecuador, I bought the phone with the help of a relative. I received the phone in perfect conditions, no problems with hardware or software. The first two weeks I enjoyed a lot the phone. But two days ago, I had a terrible issue: the phone stopped working. The screen is in black, the LED of notifications doesn't work, the phone won't turn on. I'm not a novice in this kind of things, so I tryed to turn on the device. I've tryed in three different ways: firstable I tryed to hold on the power button with the +volume button for 10 seconds and the phone is supposed to vibrate but anything happens. My second option was the little OFF button which is located near from the sim card, I read that holding on the OFF button for 10 seconds can help but again anything happens, other sources say that you have to hold on the OFF button for 120 seconds, I've tryed but again, anything.Finally I tryed with the PC Companion, but when I start the process the PC doesn't recognize the phone, and it says that I have to hold on the power button with the +volume button, but again anything happens.I didn't do anything weird with the phone, just installing the most common apps, do some calls. But the phone just stopped working. It's obvious that is not the battery, I checked it before the phone died and the battery was in 80% of charge. As you can read, I tryed a lot of things but the phone don't want to come alive again. I don't think the problem is the screen because as I said, even the LED of notifications and the vibration have gone. I'm really mad about that. I'm searching for a special center here in my town, but I want to tell you my problem. I hope that someone can help me with this. Finally I want to show you that the phone is not broken or things like that. Thank you for reading and excuse me if I did somegrammatical mistakes.",11,4
Sony,"Here is what I personally think of the Xperia Z5.I have to say this has to be the best phone I've ever used, the features are incredible and so is the hardware. I've been an iphone user for about 6 or 7 years, in all that time owning a galaxy s3 and having a horrible experience of it breaking the second week I had it, so to me it was too delicate and expensive. So just until a few months ago I had the ""all new"" iPhone 6 plus. Before that I had the I phone 5s and it was pretty solid and fast for the time. Well just after owning the I phone for about a month the camera stopped working so I had to send it out to Apple to get the camera fixed, turns out they sent me a new one. Well all was good for about two more months when one day I forgot my phone in my back pocket and sat down in my car and I shattered the screen and bent the thin aluminum housing.that was it after seven years it was over, it was time for something else.So on to the phone...Compared to the I phone this phone is way ahead of its league. Let me start of with what I've noticed in the week that I've owned the phone. When I go to you tube and choose the 1080p option it works flawlessly with zero buffering,as to the I phone I could never watch 1080p, it would never load. Another thing is the keyboard, it is spot on. It is rare if I ever press the wrong letter while I'm trying to type, where as the I phone I would ALWAYS press the wrong key, it was extremely frustrating. Another thing I like is the ability to choose from 8,16,20,23 mp depending on the type of picture your taking and they all come out extremely detailed. Plus the ability to record in 4K. So far I love it. I also like how everything is connected. If I set a reminder or appointment it will automatically sync with my account and I'll actually get an email. So far that's all I've discovered for now, this phone is packed full of features and options I haven't even had the time to take advantage of. All I can say is I'm more than happy I made the decision to switch and chose a great phone to replace it with.",12,5
Sony,"(Update review) 4 month now with the phone and i got a problem the power button stop working to wake the phone i have to use my nail because the button is stick to the phone this problem is common in this model this is a nightmare(power button stuck so is a hardware problem). I chat with sony support and they told me this phone is a hong kong version so they can't help me. (Sorry for my bad english)The phone is beautiful the feel is really premium the back of the phone is so much better, is matte so you don't have fingerprints problems anymore and is anti scratch, the sound of the speakers are really good the speakers are in the front(i like that). the sound with the earbuds are excellent Sony has his own Equalizer (in sound settings) the sound is really good with earbuds.The screen is really good but is not the best, Sony has bad viewing angle and the screen is too glossy(still is a good screen maybe in top 5 screens). i think samsung S6 have better screen and better camera. The first few days the phone is little heat in the top corner because i used a lot installing and doing updates and playing with the phone , but later days you have no problems with the heat.The battery is a beast some days i come home with 60% and the charge is so fast, Sony call it quick charge.The volume buttons are in really bad spot, sometimes i dont know if my phone is upside down because the position of the volume are in the bottom really weird, took me a week master the volume :).Sony is really late with this phone because is not better in speed screen or camera than samsung S6 is so late to the market i think carriers is Usa don't want this phone.(review date) The sim card and memory slot are really difficult to take out at the beginning you have to check youtube to do it, then is easy, i like that you don't need a pin to change sim card so when i travel i can change sim card in the plane with no problem.So why i bought this phone ? i do a lot of exercise and i always have my phone in my pocket and usually the sweat kill my camera.(that happend with my last 2 phones) this phone is waterproof so i have no problem running or Jogging or in the gym and the sound is crazy on spotify the phone is really beautiful the camera is very good the android version is good, look almost like stock android there's some apps that you can't uninstall, you have to life with those apps :( (i hate that) I know samsung S6 is $150 cheaper but for my lifestyle is better for me Z5 i am really happy with the phone.

Sony,"I'm not too impressed with the phone so far. The overall design is very similar to the Z3 except for the finger print scanner which is great. I like how the charge port is on the bottom of the phone without a cover unlike the Z3's side covered port.I took my Z3 all over the world where the battery life was excellent and the signal was great. I find traveling with the Z5 to not be up to par with the Z3. I feel like I'm constantly charging the Z5 and I have a harder time acquiring service. At home (in the US) my Z3 had full bars and good 4G LTE connection all over the state. With the Z5 I only get half bars and it drops calls (not often but compared to the Z3, which didn't drop calls, it's a little annoying). With the Z3 the charge would last a full day to a day and a half. Now I have to charge twice a day with the Z5. Not all the time depending on usage, but it's obvious the charge doesn't last as long as the Z3's.Also, the Z5 seems to overheat. More so than the Z3 did. Just turning it on seems to heat the phone. I don't have my Z3 anymore so I can't compare the two.I feel like I wasted my money buying a finger print scanner. Maybe I have a defective phone? Maybe service sucks in the US because it's an Asia model? Overall, I'm not impressed.",23,3
Sony,"I ordered my phone from Cellphone Lifestyle and it arrived early and looked exactly as expected. This is to replace a T-Mobile Z3 that I dropped and broke. I very much liked the Z3 but T-Mobile no longer offers them. This new Z5 is freakin awesome I totally love it. Just a lovely and elegant design, and it's plenty speedy for whatever I use it for. I just popped in my old SIM card and it worked perfectly. Hard to imagine ever not using a Sony phone again.",21,5
Sony,"Alright so after about a full month of using, I think I'm ready for a review now. First of all let me note that I use a E6683(Dual SIm) and its from Hong Kong. The first thing I will say is YES the LTE does work in the US, be it T-mobile or AT&T actually any GSM carrier will do.Screenƒ?› The screen is really sharp even though it's just a 1080p, thanks to it X-reality. However if you were to compare this to a Galaxy S6 or any smartphone with a AMOLED display, I would say the AMOLED does produce more vibrant color. Pixel vise I highly doubt anyone can tell the different unless you hold the very very close to your eyes (which of course, not a lot of people will do that). I do think that reading on the Z5 is more comfortable thoughSoundƒ?› Sony has a lot of commercial regarding about their ""Hi-res"" music and ""Hi-res"" player and I think they are right. The stereo front speaker is nice since you will rarely block it but don't get your hope on it since its not really that loud. I mean you wouldn't want to use it as an entertain system with a lot of people anyway. Next the headphone, I've seen a lot of review saying the sound quality isn't as good as the other smartphone out there, in this case I will have to take a different ground. I own a Sony MDR-1ADAC and the sound is amazing when pair with the Z5. I tried compare with it Galaxy S6 and to me I feel like there is clearly different quality in music. On the down side, you are require to have a Hi-res music quality otherwise the quality isn't that . . . .Performanceƒ?› ""SoC 810 does it overheat ?"" my answer is ""It really depend"" If you're recording a 4K video then yes it will definitely heat up but so does the other smartphone. Gaming vice I think the Z5 is doing fantastic, the Z5 can run any game so far that I tried smoothly. It does though lag sometime when it heats up (rarely, like 1% ) and has low battery mode is activate. It definitely run smoother than my HTC oneM9+ haha.ƒ?› Now everyday uses such as email, texting, web surfing, all of these are buttery smooth. In fact I would say any flagship is the same in this area, unless you came from an IOS which is a lot heck smoother.Cameraƒ?› That hybrid focus ! Yes it focus really fast BUT it take like a WHILE to processing the image. If you came from a Galaxy S6 or even from an Iphone 5 you will notice a substantial different in time. Iphone took a picture in like a blink of an eye, while S6 is a little slower than that but still in a blink of an eye. But for the Z5 its like 1-2 second on camera processing after picture was taken which can be huge deal if you really need to get that picture. I would say the Z5 is more like a digital camera since it be ""hit"" then done. The image quality though I would say the Z5 is better compare to the S6 or Iphone 6 but its not really a by a big margin though. Also if you really want to take a professional picture, then any smartphone wouldn't do as of now. Overall I wouldn't sacrifice the 1-2 second for a little better camera, but if you can live with that, then I would just say go ahead.ƒ?› Front camera is okay but wouldn't say it's the best out there in the market compare to like a selfie centred phone. It does produce a satisfy result though.Softwareƒ?› If you like Stock-Android then you will probably like this too. It ran almost identical to stock android except with the small app. There's a bloatware but you can un-install it or just disable it. The finger print scanner on this phone is superb, its super and way more accurate than the Iphone 6 or even the S6 (at least to me).ƒ?› This is for people who has a PS4 and want it to use for a remote play. It work technically but don't expect the same experience from the TV also a good internet connection is require to a smooth remote play too. Unless you want to connect you Z5 to a Lan cable, which work haha (I did that :D)ƒ?› The battery on this phone is last longing, you can expect a whole day or more with this phone. The charging is quite slow to me though even with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but maybe I was just used to a tiny battery of an Iphone 6 and S6.Phoneƒ?› The phone also come with expandable storage which could give you an 32GB boost in less than $50ƒ?› The water proof and dust proof thingy isn't really a big deal if you're always careful around with your phoneƒ?› The strap hooker or whatever it call, to me is something I really miss. With this I can use the phone without fear of dropping, I can even take a photo without fear of dropping the phone into a river, jungle, mountain or so whatever you can name it.OverallThe phone is a premium phone if you ask me but does it worth the price, I wouldn't say it worth it to buy this phone as of now. The music quality on this phone is superb if you use a Hi-res audio and headphone. The camera is also really good but take about 1-2 second longer than the IPhone or S6 to process the image. Heating isn't something you have to worry anymore, as per gaming it will eventually heat up after a while of playing but so does every phone. Overall I would say this is a great phone, it would be perfect for me if the camera processing is at least as fast as the S6",17,5
Sony,"great phone, update helps. fingerprint scanner is fast and works 9 out of 10 times, camera colors are reproduced but quality of pic and zoom is amazing. screen is very good and so is the battery life. charges quick with quickcharge 2.0 have dropped this phone in a glass of water and ran it under the sink many times and it works just like its advertised. the matte gold finish is amazing and doesnt attract fingerprints at all. android os is simple and works really well. front speakers are not bad, bluetooth connects really fast compared to my note 5 and iphone 6s. solid phone with quality written all over it. wish the bezels were smaller thou",16,5
Sony,"Okay, just so you know, I am what you might call an ""early adopter"" In other words I am a sucker for smartphones. Every time somone came out with something new I just had to have one for my own. Ever since I brought home my brand new first generation iPhone, I have always been enthralled with these little magical rectangles made of metal and glass. I have had every iteration of iPhone, right on up through the 6S. I have had three HTC's including the amazing M7 and M8. I have owned a OnePlus one, an LG V10 a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, and I still use my S7 Edge as a back up phone. But, I can honestly and unequivocally say that not a single one of them hold a candle to the Xperia Z5 Premium. The 4K display is amazing of course, and the camera is incredible, but what makes this phone stand out is that every little feature that it has works flawlessly. I liked my Galaxy phones but both of them would heat up, lock up, refuse to connect to my car via bluetooth, refuse to charge ...the list goes on. On the other hand, the iPhones worked perfectly, but the un-customizable UI just became so damned tedious after a while. Enter the Z5 Premium. It has none of the cartoonish color saturation and UI of the Galaxy models that the tekkies fawn over. The Z5 Premium just has a 4K display that is smoother, cleaner perfectly colored and blows your mind when you watch 4K media. Anybody who has ever seen a Sony Bravia HDTV as compared to a Samsung will know what I mean. The Sony makes the images look like they are recorded on smoothsilky 16mm film, while the Samsung's images ""pop out"" but look like they are recorded on soap opera videotape. Moreover, every single little feature that glitches or lags, or freezes the Samsung, the Z5 Premium handles without even breaking a sweat. The Z5 Premium's hardware feels ""premium"" in the hand and it's solid, minimalistic, thin bezeled design is pure art. Oh, and did I mention that it's water resistant? Yeah, customizable too. I read somewhere that the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the ""Lamborghini"" of smart phones. Let the kids have their ""Lamborghini"", I will happily keep my ""Aston Martin"" Xperia Z5 Premium.Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual E6883 5.5"" 23MP 32GB Smartphone - International Version / No Warranty (Black)",20,5
Sony,Exactly as described loved the phone and arrived earlier than expected,10,5
Sony,"Probably the best phone in the US that no one has heard of unless you're a phone geek. I've had to work with phones for 10 years in the cellular industry and have seen many phones come and go. I have loved the recent Xperia series from Sony and always believe that they deliver the best products. In terms of phones, it's no secret that Sony has had a rocky history to say the least (Sony Ericsson partnership and a myriad of failures).I'll try and keep this short, but at least provide some more of a detailed review. Feel free to check the other versions of Z5 Premium (Chrome and Black) for others, but I notice the Gold version is sorely lacking any thorough review so here go:I've been using this phone for about month and don't typically review anything until I have had a chance to use it for more than a few days. First impressions can be misleading, so I let myself download apps, use throughout the day, take pictures, videos, etc and get a feel for the phone. I will say I have used a few other Xperias before. I am jumping from a Xperia Z1 I purchased in Japan about 2 years ago and loved that phone as well. Probably some Sony fanboy-ish going on here, but I will try and be as neutral as possible.Performance of the phone is fantastic. Everything moves very quick and smooth. Responds very well overall. One of my favorite features (yes it's nothing new, but performs so so well) is the fingerprint scanner. Like I said, I have worked in the cellular industry and I know the iPhone first brought this to the mainstream but I've really found myself using the fingerprint scanner a lot and the fact that the phone is larger, the scanner is actually a much easier way to unlock the screen than sliding up the unlock motion. And again, it just works so smooth!Perhaps my favorite part of this phone, and a big purchasing decision, is the camera. I have two little ones and whenever the family is out, I am typically default camera man, so there was a lot of debate with the wife as to whether I should invest in a good DSLR camera or buy the loaded Z5P phone. I haven't regretted my decision as the Z5P takes beautiful pictures, 23MP, though I find myself using the 20MP 16:9 format and even the Premium Auto mode is great for taking quick shots (using the quick wake up mode). Yes, it does take 4K video, which looks unbelievable. And Sony does have a little snapshot tool to take 8MP screenshots of 4K video stills if you so desire. The 4K SCREEN ON THE PHONE looks phenomenal. I've read a lot of tech sites instantly saying that the 4K screen is unnecessary and a gimmick, however to be honest, I'm not sure what screen they're looking at. I've put up the Z5P screen next to my Z1 (1080p) and for me personally I can definitely tell a difference. The Z5P is so much clearer and the colors are very vibrant (though not overly saturated). Also, the camera has a 1080p/60fps video mode which also works great. Lastly, the camera has an insanely fast autofocus, which does actually autofocus, which helps with quickshots. Again, camera alone was worth the purchase.Battery: Always a touchy issue with so many and always the quickest to get people to stop buying your product. With heavy usage, and again, from experience, I know what constitutes heavy, you can still EASILY get a days worth of usage on your phone. I have tried several times to intentionally kill my battery doing things that typically kill other phones instantly--biggies being streaming video, games, GPS, camera and the often under-appreciated phone calls/video(data) calls. I don't think people really know how much phone calls kill your battery, but again, tried to get it to under a day and it didn't really work. I would still have about 20% at the end (say 9-10pm) of the day. Now again, I don't have the luxury of literally sitting down from 8am-8pm doing nothing but that, but throughout the day, I would watch/play/listen/etc and still had enough battery to do more by the time I put the kids to bed. Also, the last few days I've been trying something else and seeing how the battery preserves itself. During work, I don't heavily use my phone (because, you know, I'm WORKING), but even at that with 2 email accounts synced up, and other various services running (mind you, no facebook, twitter or other SNS-sorry no social life :) I still do some messaging but still have about 80% at the end of day. I DO NOT charge the phone overnight, lose a couple more percentages and start day 2 with about 75-78%. I then continue to work again and continue to drain battery and again still have a moderate (about 65%) battery. Now again, by no means am I saying this is an end-all guide to the 5-day battery phone, but again, for practical usage for people who don't live on their phones 24/7 I can easily get 3 working days of usage on my phone, maybe 4 if I push it. Again many factors go into this, screen brightness, accounts, etc. but I have been thrilled with my battery life.Ok, I'm rambling too much so I'll wrap it up. Quickly wanted to address a negative:Bezel--never understood why people think this phone has larger bezels than others. I think there was someone who actually measured the % of screen that the bezels take up and Xperias actually have a better % than iPhones and some others. Now one thing I will note is the 3 touch buttons (back, home and apps) are taking up part of the 5.5"" screen. While others, like Samsung have the buttons underneath so you get a true full screen. Anyway, minor design gripe, but still more than enough real estate on the screen.Little extra here too, again, read about how some people thought it was such a novelty that the phone was water/dust proof rated yet kept the charging port open. If you have experience with Japanese phones, you probably know that waterproofing phones is very old news. Almost all Japanese phone manufacturers, Sony, Sharp, Kyocera, make all their phones waterproof because many Japanese take their phones in the bath with them. In fact, my wife has a basic Sharp Aquos from about 2-2 1/2 years ago that is also waterproof, but already had the open charging port design implemented. Again, just a little tidbit there about the novelty of waterproofing phones, so yes the charging port is open, but the phone is still sealed. I also can attest to this as I have used the phone for pictures in not only heavy rainfall but also at a waterpark (my little girl drenched my phone but totally fine).Alright, I'm done now. Hopefully this helped out and if you purchase it, ENJOY!",105,5

Sony,"Robert here...I got my Z5 Premium this past Sunday and thus far, I absolutely LOVE this phone. After doing much research, I picked the single sim International version as it has capacity for faster download. I'm really impressed with the sound quality of this piece. I'd been using an old Droid3 as my Mp3 player and using a cheap ZTE Maven as my communicator with Cricket service. I had to take it to a Cricket store to get the mini sim cut to nano size (free). Being an E6853 vs the E6883, the product registration site wouldn't allow me to register so I had to call. It turns out mine was originally set for the Panamanian market. The young lady I spoke with, Alice, was very helpful with getting me set up for my 1 yr warranty.I chose the gold color and it is so beautiful. It's such a shame I have to cover it up with a TUDIA Slim-Fit MERGE case. The case actually is very nice though. I am really afraid of damaging this thing.I chose the Z5 Premium mostly for it's music handling prowess. This thing must have some Walkman genes in it. I think I found a replacement for my Zune with the cracked screen. I've read some iffy reviews regarding the fingerprint scanner but' I've not had any problem with it at all. It does not work when you first power up the phone and that's by design. The volume button location is a bit kooky but, I can get used to that. It seems a bit slow to sync with MediaPlayer. I'm gonna try and use a faster port. I've also heard of people complaining about a lack of image stability. Mine has it and it works very well. One cool thing I found with this being an unlocked phone is I'm able to use tethering on USB/Bluetooth and WiFi HotSpot with no restrictions.This is going to be a rolling review as I gain more experience with it so, I will update later.Update: 08/09/2016I've had my phone shut down/reboot on me twice. Both times it had been in my front jeans pocket. I bet it overheated and went into protection. Thinking back now, I wonder if this is why I've had so much trouble with my android phones. I've had them reboot on me before and this Xperia Z5 Premium is the first one that's performed the same after. I think I like that. I'm still going to work on that pocket thing though. Everything else is perfect so far.",12,5
Sony,"I'm a big Sony fan, and think they make great products, much more so than Samsung, LG or even HTC, and certainly on par with Apple. Sony products are well designed/engineered, solid build quality consistent with the long established reputation. Where as Samsung/LGs may have great specs. on paper and look good on the outside, their inside components are definitely lower quality in call quality, antenna reception or durability/design. Just remember there are no free lunches out there. Samsung LG is more like Honda/Toyota and will never be BMW/Mercedes. I have been using Sony smart mobile phone/tablets pretty much for the last 3 years now, and I'm hooked. From the Sony Xperia Z, to the Z Ultra, to the Z1s, Z3 smartphones, Z, Z2, Z3 tablet compact, to the Z4 tablet and now trying the Z5 premium. I have to say that While it's not Sony's fault in the SD810 processor, all the overheating issues are still true, no matter what Sony had tried, to engineer extra heatsinks to dissipate the extra heat generated by a horribly made Qualcomm SnapDragon 810. Qualcomm SD810 single handedly ruined this otherwise superior phone. From the 4k Screen, touch screen improvements, to the beautifully made premium look and feel, having all the makings of a topline product. In 90 degree+ ambient temperatures, normal use, no multimedia, the phone got hot enough that I can't take a call without a BT device, because putting it up against my face is too uncomfortably hot. Even though the phone doesn't shut down, but you'll feel like you're holding a hot potato in your hands and that's not good. This would have been a wonderful device, and potentially a top seller had it come with the SD820 chipset, what a combination that would be. This also explains why Sony decided to not sell any of the Z5s here in the US, as American tech savvy consumers will not likely put up with overheating issues. So I would say, if you love Sony's get the Z3s, no issues what so ever, or skip the Z5s and go straight to X series, but know you're no longer getting the best latest greatest from Sony with the Xperia Xs. Wish I had better news, but I'm struggling with upgrade choices as well.",12,3
Sony,"This is my first ever Android Phone, having used BlackBerry since 2009. So most of my ""problems"" are just learning a new User Interface / Operating System (I'd have that problem regardless of what Android or Apple phone I switched to).One feature I didn't think I'd use is the fingerprint scanner. This scanner is accurate and trouble free. I love it. Compared to my wife's Note 5, it feels like a next generation technology (I don't tell her that). The USA Version of the regular Z5 has deleted this option. Big mistake, I'd get the international version of the Z5 regardless if I was getting the Premium or not. It's a very cool scanner, very impressed with the technology.I saw a few reviews saying that LTE doesn't work - it does. It doesn't display ""4GTLE"" it only displays ""4G"" but rest assured you're on LTE. I took a screenshot of a speed test using T-Mobile, USA but AT&T is also a GSM carrier and this phone has the bands for it as well.OK, I love the screen. I know that OLED is all the rage these days but I love this LCD screen because it can dim low in a dark room and can get very bright. The auto sensor works great on this phone too. The screen is beautiful.The camera is great! Coming from BlackBerry which always used subpar crappy cameras, I admit anything would have been an improvement but it takes great photos in line with my wife's Note 5 (probably better but we won't tell her).The front stereo speakers are fine. They are not as loud as one or two out there but are louder and clearer than many if not most.I love that it's water resistant.It looks beautiful. I got the Chrome but since I'm afraid to carry it naked and put a minimal transparent case on it, I'm wondering if I shouldn't have gone with the Gold. Any color choice is beautiful.As far as the 4K - The stock 4K video by Sony does look great but so does anything I'm viewing on here. I'd base my choice between Z5 or Z5 Premium based on what you prefer in phone size and screen size rather than 4K or not.I used to love BlackBerry because I liked carrying something different (they are very rare these days in the US) and I like this phone for the same reason. Everyone has either an Apple or a Samsung - but this Sony is something different. I really like it and recommend it.I intend on updating this review at the start of 2017 to give an update on how it works long term. But the initial quality is outstanding.",26,5
Sony,"Awesome phone, lots of people have commented it while I use it. Love it. The back I use as a mirror.",13,5
Sony,"This phone is awesome! Nice big vivid screen, stylish gorgeous looks that make you want to double take. Gives you a really good quality premium feel for a phone. Sound clarity is decent with two front facing speakers. Words of advice protect this phone from front to back because it easily slips right through your fingers making it very easy to drop, but other than that I love this phone and highly recommend it if you have the extra money to throw at it!",23,5
Sony,"Came a day earlier than expected! The phone is brand new, booted up and is working on AT&T (and probably any other GSM network). I was pleasantly surprised that mine came with headphones and the quick charger! Hopefully, everything continues to work fine and I won't have to deal with any peculiar defects.",15,5
Sony,"Base on some commends on the web, sounded like this one would work with T-Mobile's LTE. Well I give it a shot. So far, I have tried to enable different radio software and all I got is HSPA+. But the HSPA+ is faster than my Galaxy Nexus. Good news is, this phone works with my $5.00 Tzone plan. Will T-mobile stop it in a few days.... time will tell.The speaker is loud, but not clear like the HTC one. I like the screen size and it's very stylish. For $50 more, I would get the C6506 with LTE instead.",10,4
Sony,"1 hour review.Pros:Fast - Quad-core CPUDesign - Love the slick, compact design with camera features. Reminds me of my old K750i. Roughly the same size as the Galaxy S2Screen - Bright, clear and the viewing angles isn't an issue for meOS - Sony's typical foot print. I prefer this over Tmobile or any carriers in general because they don't install a ton of bloatwareCamera - Very nice, the smile shutter? feature is awesome. Taking pictures in 9m mode will be 16x9 formatCons:Speaker isn't as loud or clear as previous Sony phonesPhone runs HOT. Was looking around in the settings etc and the phone already got warm.Overall, I'm loving this phone. I'll probably update this review once I get more hands on experience with it.",22,5
Sony,"Over the last few years I've used several devices ranging from the OG Droid, Droid 2, and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. I was on the market to purchase a new phone because I was looking for cheaper service and all of my phones were on Verizon's network. I've always been a Sony fanboy, and I already own their Tablet S, PSP, PS3, and Vaio. The Xperia ZL Allowed for seamless integration between them all, and shares data and media between them easily. The phone is comfortable to hold and doesn't feel too light or heavy. I opted for the ZL over the Z because i wanted the physical camera button, and I wasn't a huge fan of all the flaps that Sony had used on the Z to make it waterproof. The Camera quality is amazing and all of the filters and add-ons have been fun to use. Sony adds a slight skin on top of Jelly Bean 4.2, but only so that icons and transitions have been a little stylized, making it an easy transition from my Nexus device. I ditched my data plan with Verizon, and am using a call & txt plan with Red Pocket Mobile. I'm reliant on wi-fi for data, but surprisingly it hasn't been a problem. I would definitely recommend this phone to others who love a pretty screen, a good camera(13mp), and value a quality build.",17,5
Sony,"There are better reviews than I could do written elsewhere, just wanted to comment a little.I have it rooted and the bootloader unlocked, running PACMan ROM(CM10.1 based) perfectly fine.If you have decent headphones the output on this tends to be a little quiet.It comes with a screen protector pre-installed. (but it still scratches easy, I ended up buying another one and plopping it on top)Once again, it's red. When I ordered this I didn't realize until a couple days later when I was looking at the order that it was, in fact, red and not black as I thought.I wasn't attached to it being black so it still looks good.Battery will last about 5 hours of non-stop video watching, or 20+ hours(I haven't gone past that yet) if you're not really using your phone much for anything(like maybe 30-60 minutes of sporadic screen usage for messaging or something in the whole day at minimum brightness)I don't see what the big fuss about viewing angles is, it doesn't render it unreadable or anything... It's not even bothersome if I'm watching a video.T-Mobile just started rolling out LTE in Los Angeles so I've been picking that up around town, I'm able to reach speeds of almost 30/10 in some areas.Overall, coming from a Samsung Exhibit II 4G aka Galaxy Exhibit 4G, I'm fairly happy with this purchase.08/14/13 Update: Still going strong, running Illusion ROM now. Also wanted to comment that if you want to use this phone on T-Mobile it's as simple as ordering a mini-SIM card from them and putting it in.(Obviously you need service too) If you already have a T-Mobile SIM card then you can take it to any T-Mobile store and they will resize it for you, otherwise it costs about $20 to get a replacement SIM.11/13/13 Update: Everything's good in Sonyland, I'm now running Omni ROM which has great performance so far, I've combined it with Xposed Framework + Modules to get back the features that are missing from other ROMs, everything works great. Battery life is pretty decent so far, depends on how much I use the screen and whether I'm on mobile data or not. If I'm at home all day on Wifi and not using my phone much besides listening to some stuff now and then and some socializing, I'm at 46% after 14 hours.Now, in the real world, when I'm working and out and about, I tend to get about 8-10 hours before I hit the 20% mark, but personally I use my phone a lot when I'm working for various things, Wifi hotspot and Wifi analyzer are probably the most draining, along with using the screen more simply to look stuff up. Some people might fare better, but even still in an age where you can find an outlet anywhere, and car chargers are fairly cheap, I don't really see any reason to be worried about the battery, unless you plan on watching videos all day, in which case you can expect the same 5 hour battery life as the Galaxy S4.Myself, I carry a 12000mAH(claimed) backup battery when I need to charge while working around since I don't like leaving my phone to sit by an outlet(plus it looks a little janky), but the only times I've truly needed this are during a convention where there was poor mobile data reception and wifi was outrageously priced, thus forcing my phone to work probably twice as hard to maintain a decent connection, thus draining the battery faster than normal.Also, I have to exclaim about the build quality on this phone as it seems to be really quite solid, due to various mishaps my phone has fallen a couple of times onto concrete from probably 3-4 feet with just some minor cosmetic damage mostly on the bottom left corner, what was really surprising was the second time I dropped it, now keep in mind I have a Skinomi screen protector which has kind of a soft springy feel to it, the second time I dropped it the phone had landed flat on it's face, when I picked it up I was amazed to see not a single scratch of damage. My running theory is that the screen protector absorbed most of the shock, but even still, whatever Sony did with this phone seems to be alright.So far though, my biggest gripe is whatever amp they used on the phone is simply not powerful enough. For the earpiece it seems to be more than adequate, but I often find myself wishing to be able to raise the volume past maximum during a call on speakerphone, and the headphone out is just simply not powerful enough for most headphones.Now, after almost half a year, would I recommend this phone to people? Maybe. If you want more accessories or stronger developer support, the Nexus 5 is a fine choice along with the Galaxy S4 and LG G2. If you want a great phone that compliments class and is different compared to most people, I would strongly suggest the ZL. If you want a phone that's waterproof, you should probably be looking at the Xperia Z or Z1 not the ZL.In the end it comes down to preference, You have the Nexus 5 which is quite nice albeit lacking any sort of excitement and a microSD slot, the Galaxy S4 which is more expensive and everybody and their mothers have one(though the replaceable battery is quite nice), the LG G2 which is pretty much the Nexus 5 but with a bigger battery and with LG's software mods, then you have the Xperia Z1 which is just a second generation Z, and finally the HTC One which not only is similar in price to the S4 but it also lacks a microSD slot.And then the ZL itself, expensive yes, but not too expensive, different from the majority in design, yet similar in performance(for the most part), if anything, the ZL is a jack of all trades, master of none, managing to exceed at not exceeding, which sounds kind of dumb but if you have the phone it kind of makes sense, it's simply a good phone, nothing more, nothing less.Honestly the most surprising part of this phone is that the battery isn't removeable, considering the Xperia ZR, which is also waterproof mind you, does include this feature.Here's hoping to a new ZL for 2014 that can truly set a name for itself.04/28/14 Update: New builds of 4.4 ROMs for this phone have been pretty damn good at managing battery life, I usually expect my phone to last at least 8-12 hours during a normal workday, though I think my record so far is 35 hours, which was staying home for 2 days and using my phone only for some podcast listening.Performance feels smoother with newer ROMs, hoping to better battery and performance once the Sony official 4.4 ROM is out.I've gone through various screen protectors at this point, mostly to experiment, I still think Skinomi is the best at actually protecting your screen but it can sometimes make the screen look a little funny.A little bit of the paint on the back has scratched off but I think that's from the fall it took before, I just never noticed.Everything else on the phone is still in perfect, functioning order.",13,5
Sony,"I was really happy with the phone, it was great, but after 3 months of using it the WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity started to fail until it stopped from connecting to all networks.Factory reset or repairing android with PC companion didn't solve the issue.Apparently this is a very common defect. I recommend carefully reading of Sony support forums, just search online for ""xperia zr wifi issue"" on your favorite search engine before buying this. You will find a LOT of complains.Note that my phone was never in contact with water or dropped, flashed or anything else.I recommend carefully reading of Sony support forums (search online for ""xperia zr wifi issue"" before buying this).Sadly Xperia Care is not supporting the warranty outside the U.S.[UPDATE] I managed to send it over to Sony, after explaining the issue several times, the unit was replaced for a new one. I hope it lasts this time.",10,2
Sony,"I lost my Note 2 to my swimming pool and didn't want to make the same mistake twice, so I purchased this phone to make sure water damage never claimed my phone again.I'm happy to report the phone functions more smoothly than the Samsung Note 2 & is far less glitchy.I kept wondering why the Note 2 had so many good reviews once I started using it because just before the Note 2 I had a iPhone 4s, obviously if you've used an iPhone, you'd naturally know the 4s functioned much better than the Note 2, well, the same does not apply to this phone.The Xperia in so many ways works just as well if not better than my phone just prior to the Note 2 (the 4s) - In fact it's likely the best functioning phone I've ever had.One thing I really really don't like about it is the face cam, it's awful. Yes, the regular camera is super high res, but if you're planning on taking a lot of instagram pics of yourself, you'll have to get good at doing it blind, because the face cam is pretty darn useless in low light & certainly isn't high res even in good lighting.If any new developments come up, I'll let you know.",17,5
